WEBVTT

00:42.199 --> 00:46.202
Ah, so satisfied drinking.

00:46.203 --> 00:50.164
Ah, so lazy to go home.

00:50.165 --> 00:52.458
Just stay overnight, Suneo.

00:52.501 --> 00:54.502
But Dekisugi also drank a lot, right?

00:54.503 --> 00:57.004
I use the "Wake Up Soon"
gadget so I'm not drunk.

00:57.005 --> 00:57.838
Me too.

00:57.839 --> 01:01.050
Haha, you two are really boring.

01:01.051 --> 01:04.136
Why drink if you wake up quickly?

01:04.930 --> 01:08.224
Goodbye, Nobita!
Don't get lost on the road, OK.

01:08.225 --> 01:09.517
Okay, Gian.

01:09.518 --> 01:14.522
Yeah, but he's on auto-drive,
so there's no way to get lost.

01:14.523 --> 01:16.649
That's right, hahaha.

01:18.276 --> 01:20.194
Sorry, I can't come tomorrow.

01:20.195 --> 01:22.947
There is a sudden work, right?
That can't be help.

01:22.948 --> 01:25.408
Being an elite person
is indeed difficult, huh.

01:25.409 --> 01:27.451
Bye, yes.

01:27.452 --> 01:30.413
Goal: Go home. Go, scooter.

01:30.414 --> 01:33.040
Tomorrow, don't be late, you know!

01:33.041 --> 01:34.542
I know too!

01:37.212 --> 01:41.048
Finally tomorrow comes the day.
His wedding day.

01:41.466 --> 01:43.843
Even though he is just Nobita.

01:58.859 --> 02:00.192
Doraemon...

02:30.474 --> 02:34.602
We'll see the wedding
day next time, shall we?

02:34.603 --> 02:38.105
Okay. Let's hurry back to our times.

02:38.106 --> 02:41.859
I also want to meet Shizuka at my dinner.

03:19.314 --> 03:22.233
Birthday, birthday!

03:22.234 --> 03:25.444
I am home!
Mom, what's for lunch today?

03:25.445 --> 03:27.530
Nobita!

03:27.906 --> 03:31.784
I found this in your desk drawer!

03:32.744 --> 03:36.205
Can't we talk about this later?

03:36.206 --> 03:37.289
Today it's...

03:37.290 --> 03:38.791
It is enough!

03:38.792 --> 03:42.753
I'm not angry because you got zero points,
but because you hid this paper!

03:42.754 --> 03:45.673
Mom didn't teach you
to be a child like that!

03:45.674 --> 03:50.427
Why do you have to be mad
about this on summer vacation?

03:50.428 --> 03:52.638
How embarrassing it really is.

03:57.352 --> 03:59.728
Today is bad too, huh.

03:59.729 --> 04:01.939
Even though you don't
have to be that angry.

04:01.940 --> 04:06.402
Nothing can be done, right?
Because you're the one at fault.

04:07.529 --> 04:09.655
But today is my birthday.

04:11.241 --> 04:14.952
Could it be...
Oh, yeah. It must be!

04:14.953 --> 04:18.037
Hah? What have you
been talking about earlier?

04:18.038 --> 04:20.117
I am not the biological
child of this family.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.084
They must have picked
me up from somewhere.

04:22.085 --> 04:24.920
Hahaha, how stupid.

04:24.921 --> 04:28.132
If I were their real child,
Mother wouldn't speak that badly!

04:28.133 --> 04:31.844
After all, if I really am their son,
why did they name me Nobita?

04:31.845 --> 04:33.971
Isn't that a common name, huh?

04:33.972 --> 04:36.473
I want a cooler name!

04:36.474 --> 04:44.273
Ah, where is my biological mother?

04:44.274 --> 04:46.233
You're talking ridiculous.

04:47.110 --> 04:49.737
What are you doing up there, Doraemon?

04:49.738 --> 04:53.032
Oh, I'm checking my magic gadgets.

04:53.033 --> 04:58.996
If the floor is messy, so I use this
Gravity Paint to work on the ceiling.

04:58.997 --> 05:02.458
Now, lots of it, huh.

05:02.459 --> 05:05.809
Nobita, don't hold it
carelessly, you know. I just

05:05.821 --> 05:09.381
want to test whether these
gadgets are damaged or not.

05:09.382 --> 05:11.884
Uh, don't touch it carelessly!

05:11.885 --> 05:13.010
What is that?

05:13.011 --> 05:16.263
This is the "Stick of Forgetfulness".

05:16.264 --> 05:20.267
If we use this stick, we can
forget what happened before.

05:20.268 --> 05:23.743
Eh?! If you hit Mom
using that stick earlier,

05:23.755 --> 05:26.649
she doesn't have
to be angry like that.

05:26.650 --> 05:29.652
I wont use this wand
for something like that!

05:29.653 --> 05:33.280
Don't say that, please.
I want to borrow it.

05:33.281 --> 05:36.629
Instead of that, you
better study harder,

05:36.641 --> 05:40.162
so you don't need to
get another zero score.

05:40.163 --> 05:42.164
How can I be!?

05:45.919 --> 05:50.214
See! There is more!

05:51.549 --> 05:54.301
Already collected a lot, huh.

05:54.302 --> 05:57.596
Please, lend me that gadget!

05:57.597 --> 06:00.391
If not, please hide this in
your magic pocket, please!

06:00.392 --> 06:03.102
Cannot!

06:03.103 --> 06:06.814
How it come to this?
If she see this, surely...

06:08.608 --> 06:10.651
This is from the future department store.

06:12.195 --> 06:14.321
What is that?

06:14.322 --> 06:19.660
Sometimes, they like to send
sample items like this one.

06:19.661 --> 06:21.829
Oh, I see?

06:23.164 --> 06:25.082
Let us see

06:25.083 --> 06:27.126
Soul Swapping Ropes?

06:27.127 --> 06:29.086
Wait, again, you just grabbed it!

06:29.087 --> 06:30.087
Changing.

06:40.724 --> 06:42.599
Exchange completed.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.729
Whoa, what is this? Very weird!

06:46.730 --> 06:50.858
So this rope can be used to turn us into
someone else who also holds this rope.

06:50.859 --> 06:55.028
I became Doraemon!

06:55.029 --> 07:00.159
Hm, hm, so that's how it is.
If we use the rope one more time...

07:00.160 --> 07:01.285
Back to normal.

07:05.832 --> 07:07.541
Oh, so this is it!

07:10.503 --> 07:16.008
If so, can we not take it back one more
time, so I won't be nagged by Mother?

07:16.009 --> 07:17.801
Don't talk carelessly!

07:17.802 --> 07:19.303
You really can't, can you?

07:22.182 --> 07:26.602
Nobita! Nobita? Nobita!

07:27.896 --> 07:29.396
Oh, is that so?

07:29.397 --> 07:31.064
Are you alright?

07:32.025 --> 07:34.902
Hahaha, it worked!

07:34.903 --> 07:37.613
Are you alright? Nobita!

07:37.614 --> 07:39.239
Yes, I'm fine.

07:40.074 --> 07:43.577
I have to hurry and save both of us.

07:43.578 --> 07:46.455
Nobita! Nobita!

07:50.794 --> 07:54.671
Where the hell is he?

07:55.799 --> 07:59.051
Eh? Me why?

07:59.052 --> 08:02.554
Suddenly they drove me
here on a time machine.

08:02.555 --> 08:03.972
Who?

08:03.973 --> 08:05.933
You and I!

08:05.934 --> 08:11.522
Hey Nobita, I do not understand
at all what you are talking about.

08:11.606 --> 08:15.442
But I can only. Say that.

08:15.443 --> 08:19.071
Hm, I don't understand.

08:19.072 --> 08:22.074
Looks like something happened somewhere.

08:22.075 --> 08:26.495
Yeah, but now I'm here,
so no problem, right?

08:26.496 --> 08:30.415
Really, you are so relaxed!

08:30.416 --> 08:32.584
What's more important is this!

08:32.585 --> 08:35.586
We have to find a place
to hide, so it won't be found!

08:35.587 --> 08:40.050
Rather than that, wouldn't it
be easier if you just studied?

08:40.051 --> 08:42.802
You are very talkative, Doraemon.

08:42.803 --> 08:46.223
Nobita, go shopping for a while.

08:46.224 --> 08:47.599
It's Mother!

08:47.600 --> 08:49.935
There is something that I want you to buy.

08:54.691 --> 08:57.860
Just recently, mom said you too much.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.158
Eh? Very weird.

09:06.244 --> 09:10.205
I thought he was here. Where did he go?

09:14.043 --> 09:16.211
It's very dangerous.

09:17.505 --> 09:20.799
Oh, I found a great place!

09:22.552 --> 09:24.553
This way it's safe.

09:24.554 --> 09:27.055
Oh? It's..

09:27.140 --> 09:30.934
Wow, I missed you so much!

09:31.728 --> 09:34.897
This teddy bear that I
loved when I was little.

09:34.898 --> 09:37.399
Lots of patches, huh?

09:37.400 --> 09:40.194
Yes, Grandma fixed this.

09:40.195 --> 09:42.279
You have Grandma?

09:42.280 --> 09:45.115
She died when I was in kindergarten.

09:57.545 --> 09:58.712
This is it!

09:58.796 --> 10:02.299
The person who's Nobita hugging, right?

10:02.300 --> 10:05.344
Looks like the person
is very friendly, huh.

10:05.345 --> 10:09.556
Grandma always spoiled me.

10:18.942 --> 10:23.695
Gian... Gian broke my doll!

10:23.696 --> 10:28.533
Wow, what a pity.

10:35.959 --> 10:40.212
This, in this way, the
bear is no longer sick.

10:40.213 --> 10:41.588
Grandma!

10:42.715 --> 10:44.675
Whoa, walah...

10:44.676 --> 10:48.470
Nobita is really a spoiled child.

11:11.619 --> 11:14.641
So you've been whiny and
spoiled from then on, huh?

11:15.665 --> 11:19.626
What I want to talk about is
Grandma's kindness and warmth!

11:19.627 --> 11:21.545
Listen carefully, please!

11:21.546 --> 11:23.505
Sorry Sorry!

11:33.766 --> 11:36.768
Hah? Why, Nobita?

11:38.730 --> 11:40.147
I want to meet...

11:40.148 --> 11:41.023
Hah?

11:41.024 --> 11:45.235
I want to see Grandma one more time!

11:45.236 --> 11:47.738
If you say that too..

11:47.739 --> 11:51.408
Oh yes! If we use a time
machine, we can go back in time.

11:51.409 --> 11:53.160
Better not.

11:53.161 --> 11:53.952
Why not?

11:54.037 --> 11:58.040
If Grandma saw that you suddenly became
an adult, what do you think would happen?

11:58.041 --> 12:00.667
Surely he will be
shocked and fall and slip!

12:00.668 --> 12:02.794
If we talk carefully, she will understand!

12:02.795 --> 12:05.672
You think you can understand time machine!?

12:08.342 --> 12:09.926
But, but...

12:11.554 --> 12:15.724
Oh yes! How about we just look from afar?

12:15.725 --> 12:17.768
We can hide somewhere.

12:21.022 --> 12:23.398
After seeing her for a while,
come back straight home, huh?

12:23.399 --> 12:24.691
Hooray!

12:25.568 --> 12:26.568
Let's go!

12:33.576 --> 12:35.827
Wait a minute!

12:37.205 --> 12:39.915
We go back to when I was 3 years old.

12:43.461 --> 12:45.921
We're leaving, here.

12:45.922 --> 12:46.671
Okay!

13:03.106 --> 13:07.192
Wow, I missed you so
much! Home in the past!

13:08.361 --> 13:10.112
There's still a litter box!

13:10.822 --> 13:12.739
Oh, Persimmon fruit tree!

13:13.950 --> 13:16.284
Two years ago, this tree was cut down.

13:16.285 --> 13:21.123
Nobita, if anyone sees us it could be
dangerous. Hurry and look at Grandma!

13:22.625 --> 13:23.917
Oh yes.

13:25.128 --> 13:28.839
Grandma is always in this room.

13:28.840 --> 13:32.008
Remember, yes. Well only see her from afar.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.020
You know?

13:44.021 --> 13:47.232
Nothing. What's on the second floor?

14:03.583 --> 14:09.004
This door has always been jammed.

14:09.005 --> 14:11.298
If it can't be pulled, try to push it.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.010
Who are you?

14:16.220 --> 14:19.848
Now, so young!

14:19.849 --> 14:20.932
Is it true?

14:20.933 --> 14:24.686
But 7 years later, her face
became covered with wrinkles.

14:24.687 --> 14:25.562
Yes yes.

14:27.064 --> 14:29.941
What the hell are you guys going
into someone's house! Get out there!

14:34.030 --> 14:36.239
Even though it's me. Doesn't she know?

14:36.240 --> 14:38.825
How could she possibly know?

14:40.536 --> 14:43.830
Looks like Grandma went out.

14:46.459 --> 14:48.710
That was me when I was 3 years old!

14:48.711 --> 14:52.964
How cute. The one now isn't cute at all.

14:52.965 --> 14:54.466
What the heck?

15:02.016 --> 15:04.559
Nobita, don't cry.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.728
It's Shizuka!

15:06.729 --> 15:08.855
Let's play house.

15:10.733 --> 15:13.360
Come on, I'll take you home.

15:17.698 --> 15:20.283
Nobita is very whiny, huh.

15:22.745 --> 15:26.248
I took the candy.

15:30.378 --> 15:32.254
Why are you making fun of me?

15:32.255 --> 15:34.172
Stop it. They're just kids!

15:34.257 --> 15:37.717
Yesterday they pushed me down at school!

15:37.718 --> 15:40.178
Don't mix the past with the present!

15:47.895 --> 15:49.437
Grandma!

16:02.785 --> 16:05.787
Grandma is alive...

16:05.788 --> 16:07.289
Grandma is alive... Grandma is walking...

16:15.673 --> 16:18.800
Dad, go to work first, okay.

16:18.801 --> 16:21.678
Okay, be careful.

16:22.430 --> 16:23.888
Here's your lunch.

16:23.889 --> 16:25.015
Thank you.

16:25.016 --> 16:32.105
Wow, wow...
Nobita and Shizuka are very close, huh.

16:32.106 --> 16:33.023
Grandma!

16:34.317 --> 16:36.318
Have you bought fireworks, haven't you?

16:36.819 --> 16:41.823
Forgive me. Grandma has
been around to all the toy stores.

16:42.908 --> 16:46.953
But they only sell fireworks in summer.

16:46.954 --> 16:48.955
Don't want, don't want!

16:48.956 --> 16:50.498
Forgive me.

16:50.499 --> 16:52.584
You don't sulk like that, please.

16:52.585 --> 16:55.003
I want fireworks!

16:55.004 --> 16:57.714
Yes, sorry, yes.

16:57.715 --> 17:02.052
Shut up! I hate Grandma! Get in the house!

17:02.053 --> 17:03.428
Yes yes.

17:07.933 --> 17:10.226
I don't like Nobita like that!

17:16.317 --> 17:19.361
Hey, me! Don't be so
mean to Grandma, please!

17:25.326 --> 17:27.160
What are you doing?

17:28.371 --> 17:30.872
Why are you teasing my son?

17:32.666 --> 17:38.129
Um, er... all of this has a reason...

17:38.130 --> 17:39.631
Reason?

17:41.217 --> 17:44.636
Actually I am Nobita.

17:45.513 --> 17:47.639
Nobita is this kid, you know.

17:47.640 --> 17:52.811
No, I'm from the future...

17:52.812 --> 17:54.145
What a pity...

17:55.147 --> 17:56.898
What a freak.

17:57.733 --> 18:01.528
That's not it... Wait!

18:02.822 --> 18:06.116
See? How could they believe.

18:06.117 --> 18:10.912
Satisfied, right?
You saw Grandma, let's go home.

18:18.546 --> 18:21.214
Okay, let's go.

18:21.215 --> 18:22.632
Once again!

18:29.724 --> 18:32.517
Ah, you were that weird kid earlier!

18:32.518 --> 18:33.768
Mother!

18:38.232 --> 18:40.066
Is he really here?

18:40.067 --> 18:42.360
Geez, to enter the house.

18:42.445 --> 18:44.237
How scary.

18:44.238 --> 18:45.447
Here, here.

18:47.533 --> 18:49.951
Whose child is he?

18:53.622 --> 18:58.793
Grandma, did a strange
child come into this room?

18:58.794 --> 19:00.462
No.

19:01.255 --> 19:02.630
Hah?

19:04.341 --> 19:07.844
Seriously, where is he hiding, huh?

19:07.845 --> 19:12.724
How about this? Do I
have to go to the police?

19:14.643 --> 19:15.727
Thank you.

19:22.985 --> 19:26.821
Grandma, don't you suspect me?

19:26.822 --> 19:27.822
No.

19:30.201 --> 19:33.620
Grandma, do you really love Nobita?

19:33.621 --> 19:37.123
Yes, of course.

19:37.791 --> 19:44.214
If possible, Grandma wanted
to always be by his side.

19:45.716 --> 19:51.179
But no way, huh? Grandma is already old.

19:51.263 --> 19:54.140
Don't talk so pathetic!

19:56.018 --> 20:02.774
At the very least, Grandma
wants to see him get to school.

20:04.527 --> 20:09.113
Seeing him wearing a
backpack and going to school...

20:12.034 --> 20:14.327
Want to see it just once.

20:20.918 --> 20:22.126
Wait a minute, please!

20:26.924 --> 20:30.218
I have to wait until when? Damnit!

20:31.512 --> 20:34.305
Doraemon! Backpack, backpack!

20:34.306 --> 20:36.683
What the heck? Backpack?

20:36.684 --> 20:38.977
I want to get my backpack!

20:41.647 --> 20:43.523
Backpack, backpack!

20:46.318 --> 20:47.944
Just stop it already!

20:58.706 --> 21:00.331
Grandma.

21:01.625 --> 21:02.959
Oh...

21:02.960 --> 21:07.964
Maybe you doesn't
believe it, but I'm Nobita.

21:09.216 --> 21:12.135
That is true.

21:12.136 --> 21:16.347
From earlier Grandma thought so too.

21:17.099 --> 21:20.101
You believe it?
Don't doubt it at all?

21:21.312 --> 21:25.815
Who doubts Nobita's talk?

21:26.817 --> 21:27.984
Grandma!

21:32.031 --> 21:36.618
There, there. You are so spoiled, huh.

21:38.203 --> 21:46.502
After seeing you in elementary
school, Grandma thought.

21:47.963 --> 21:54.218
Grandma wants to see your bride just once.

21:57.598 --> 22:01.517
I understand, Grandma.
I'll show my bride to you.

22:03.228 --> 22:05.730
Wait for me, yes, Grandma.

22:05.731 --> 22:06.731
Nobita.

22:06.732 --> 22:08.232
Doraemon!

22:08.233 --> 22:10.735
Grandma believes you!

22:10.736 --> 22:13.613
Yes! Look, I want to show
Grandma a look at the future.

22:15.199 --> 22:19.243
But is it alright, making
a promise like that?

22:20.245 --> 22:22.997
The future can still change!

22:22.998 --> 22:26.125
But recently we saw my future, right?

22:26.126 --> 22:32.423
We can't say for sure that you
are 100% going to marry Shizuka.

22:34.510 --> 22:36.761
Oh yes. Time Television!

22:36.804 --> 22:38.262
Take out Time Television!

22:38.263 --> 22:40.056
Yes yes.

22:41.892 --> 22:47.146
The wedding venue was at
the Prince Melon Hotel, right?

22:47.147 --> 22:49.399
Is it alright?

22:58.325 --> 23:00.702
It can't be. Not connected, here.

23:00.703 --> 23:03.413
If he doesn't come quickly
it could be bad, right?

23:03.414 --> 23:06.582
What is Nobita doing, anyway?

23:06.667 --> 23:09.502
Ah, that's right!

23:09.503 --> 23:12.422
Until the last second it was too late.

23:12.423 --> 23:14.549
How pathetic.

23:14.675 --> 23:17.802
He couldn't not have come, could he?

23:17.803 --> 23:23.891
But there are stories, where the bride
and groom run away on their wedding day...

23:25.978 --> 23:28.062
No way, right?

23:28.063 --> 23:33.901
Nobita... Nobita, is everything okay?

23:34.528 --> 23:35.737
Grandma!

23:35.738 --> 23:38.072
Good afternoon, I am Doraemon.

23:38.157 --> 23:41.325
Yes, good afternoon.

23:41.326 --> 23:43.703
Doraemon who brought me here.

23:43.787 --> 23:47.707
If so, thank you, yes, good raccoon.

23:49.418 --> 23:51.794
I'm not a raccoon, you know.

23:51.795 --> 23:55.214
Grandma wait a little longer, yes.

23:55.215 --> 23:57.800
I will definitely meet
Grandma with my bride.

23:58.302 --> 24:01.471
Isn't it a hassle?

24:01.513 --> 24:05.808
Grandma has made strange wishes.

24:05.809 --> 24:11.189
It is okay. I just need a little more time.

24:11.190 --> 24:13.733
A little bit more! But
there is no problem, really.

24:13.734 --> 24:19.238
Oh, I see? Then just slow down.

24:19.281 --> 24:19.822
Okay!

24:20.324 --> 24:27.330
Grandma will wait here.

24:31.710 --> 24:34.796
We'll be home soon!

24:38.008 --> 24:40.092
Let's go to wedding day!

24:40.093 --> 24:44.931
It's about you, so we don't know
what problem you created this time.

25:00.906 --> 25:04.534
Ah, it's raining.

25:04.535 --> 25:06.410
Nobita, hurry up!

25:06.411 --> 25:07.203
Okay!

25:21.760 --> 25:23.678
Let's hide there.

25:36.191 --> 25:40.027
Maybe he got lost inside the hotel.

25:40.028 --> 25:42.488
Maybe. Let us find!

25:42.573 --> 25:43.823
Come on, let's follow them.

25:44.575 --> 25:45.908
Shizuka!

25:46.952 --> 25:49.453
I can't just stand by.

25:51.206 --> 25:52.748
How beautiful!

25:52.749 --> 25:55.084
Just leave it to us!

25:55.085 --> 25:56.752
Where's Nobita?

25:56.753 --> 26:01.007
Sorry, Shizuka. Also sorry to your parents.

26:01.008 --> 26:04.594
It is okay. We're just worried.

26:04.595 --> 26:06.512
Let's go there, get closer.

26:06.513 --> 26:07.597
Okay.

26:07.598 --> 26:13.227
Where is the boy?
Even though he came out before us.

26:13.228 --> 26:16.397
As long as there is no accident, it's okay.

26:16.398 --> 26:19.609
But that kid was so careless.

26:19.610 --> 26:24.655
There is currently no news of
any accidents around here at all.

26:27.034 --> 26:31.245
I wonder why, Nobita?

26:32.039 --> 26:36.751
Um, it looks like you guys are worried.

26:36.752 --> 26:39.420
But the time is near...

26:40.756 --> 26:43.925
Geez, why didn't he come?

26:43.926 --> 26:47.011
So it's true. He didn't have
confidence in himself, so he ran away.

26:47.012 --> 26:48.846
It can't be that!

26:51.516 --> 26:53.851
Nobita will definitely come!

26:59.733 --> 27:03.945
What is this? How about this?
Troublesome for everyone like this...

27:03.946 --> 27:09.617
Will the marriage be canceled?
Do something, please, Doraemon!

27:09.618 --> 27:11.911
Only you can replace, right?

27:13.163 --> 27:16.165
Before you have to wear
this and become an adult.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.459
No, no, I can't!

27:18.460 --> 27:20.586
There is only this way!

27:20.587 --> 27:22.254
I can't!

27:22.255 --> 27:23.631
Get caught!

27:31.807 --> 27:33.432
I will follow you, really.

27:34.226 --> 27:37.561
I don't understand anything about marriage!

27:37.562 --> 27:38.813
Nobita!

27:40.065 --> 27:43.609
Nobita! What are you doing until this time?

27:45.696 --> 27:48.698
Nobiita, are you okay? What happened?

27:51.702 --> 27:53.703
Um...

27:53.704 --> 27:58.332
Oh yeah, l-l got lost on the way.

28:02.337 --> 28:04.297
That's right.

28:04.298 --> 28:06.132
He really is Nobita.

28:07.342 --> 28:10.845
Come on, everyone in the
party room. Please enter.

28:10.846 --> 28:11.929
Please.

28:11.930 --> 28:13.639
"Small Light".

28:55.766 --> 28:57.808
Hey, look at that.

29:00.020 --> 29:03.773
Nobita's teeth are grinding.

29:07.027 --> 29:09.320
Is it alright?

29:10.739 --> 29:12.823
I'm here, really.

29:13.992 --> 29:16.911
That's very worrying.

29:16.912 --> 29:19.246
Start, that's it.

30:08.672 --> 30:16.971
Nobita, do you vow to marry Shizuka
and love her in good times and bad times?

30:16.972 --> 30:20.641
Vow to be with her until the end?

30:25.605 --> 30:28.399
Nobita, do you swear?

30:28.900 --> 30:30.025
Are you alright?

30:33.405 --> 30:36.449
Ah, his head is empty.

30:36.450 --> 30:38.200
What should I do?

30:38.201 --> 30:39.034
Oh yes!

30:45.792 --> 30:47.918
Oh, sorry!

30:50.422 --> 30:52.047
It's fine.

30:54.134 --> 30:57.052
I swear!

30:58.430 --> 31:00.639
Is it okay if I do it?

31:00.640 --> 31:03.267
The real one didn't come,
so it can't be helped, right?

31:04.895 --> 31:08.481
It feels so weird!

31:17.908 --> 31:21.285
Now is the time for our bride
and groom to kiss each other.

31:21.286 --> 31:23.329
Kiss?

31:25.916 --> 31:29.335
Nobita?

31:41.181 --> 31:45.184
Wow, all this can be eaten, right?

31:45.185 --> 31:49.939
Nobita, you are really relaxed,
after making a fuss like that.

31:49.940 --> 31:52.441
How delicious!

31:53.818 --> 31:55.528
Hey, Nobita.

31:55.529 --> 31:57.821
If you are too excited you
can get caught, you know!

31:57.822 --> 31:59.281
Congratulations, yes, Shizuka.

31:59.282 --> 32:01.116
Thank you.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.122
Did I catch a cold, okay?

32:09.084 --> 32:12.211
Everyone, please pay attention.

32:12.212 --> 32:17.341
Our bride and groom are
going to cut the cake now.

32:17.342 --> 32:23.013
First, let's make the
cake here. Please watch it.

32:23.014 --> 32:25.349
Those who want to see
closely are also allowed.

32:25.350 --> 32:27.017
Let's go.

32:29.646 --> 32:33.983
I couldn't believe it had rained suddenly.

32:33.984 --> 32:38.821
But it's okay. This is a gardening
party room with a see-through roof.

32:38.822 --> 32:43.242
We are given the use of this room because
the owner is an acquaintance of my father.

32:49.749 --> 32:51.542
Great! Great!

32:57.632 --> 33:00.342
Looks delicious.

33:01.970 --> 33:04.054
Hugh!

33:04.055 --> 33:10.519
The cake is finished, please cut it.

33:15.817 --> 33:16.609
'Hah?

33:16.610 --> 33:17.610
What is wrong?

33:17.611 --> 33:19.820
There is only one knife, you know.

33:19.821 --> 33:23.741
What are you saying?
We'll both hold the knife.

33:23.742 --> 33:26.035
Hehe, that's right, yeah.

33:26.036 --> 33:29.663
Nobita, cut it quickly!

33:29.664 --> 33:36.086
This cake cutting will be the first
activity the couple will do together.

33:36.171 --> 33:40.132
Nobita, look here, please!

33:41.718 --> 33:46.805
Nobita, Shizuka,
congratulations on your marriage.

33:46.806 --> 33:49.850
Even though you can only
get 0 points in the past...

33:49.893 --> 33:55.189
I'm happy you can be a good
man and get married today.

33:57.025 --> 34:00.944
Now, marriage is really fun, huh...

34:09.079 --> 34:11.955
Oh, right, Shizuka became suspicious.

34:11.956 --> 34:14.416
Eh, really?

34:14.417 --> 34:19.922
Now, let us hear the remarks from
our groom, Nobita Nobi.

34:21.049 --> 34:24.218
Oh, okay, remarks, right?

34:31.017 --> 34:32.643
Good afternoon!

34:35.480 --> 34:38.857
Ah? Why? What is wrong?

34:38.858 --> 34:43.487
Not good afternoon.
You've thought about the speech, right?

34:43.488 --> 34:46.532
Eh? Speech?

34:46.533 --> 34:51.412
Oh, yeah, so you mean that, huh?

34:52.997 --> 34:56.125
Where will I put it?

34:56.126 --> 34:58.627
I don't know, you know.

34:59.838 --> 35:03.257
If I'm not mistaken... here, right?

35:03.258 --> 35:06.510
No, this is it?

35:06.511 --> 35:08.011
There can't be.

35:09.764 --> 35:11.807
Oh yes!

35:11.808 --> 35:18.105
Hahaha, how could I forget that...
Looks like I left it in the waiting room.

35:18.523 --> 35:20.524
I'll take it first, yes!

35:22.569 --> 35:26.488
! 11 Looks like our groom
has to get ready first.

35:26.489 --> 35:28.449
Let's wait.

35:31.286 --> 35:33.746
We're really sorry...

35:35.915 --> 35:38.709
The bride and groom are such a pain.

35:38.710 --> 35:41.044
Wait a minute, give me the mic.

35:48.219 --> 35:52.639
Everyone! While waiting
for Nobita to return...

35:52.640 --> 35:57.978
I, as his best friend,
will sing for all of you.

35:58.062 --> 36:00.230
Hey... Wait... Sorry, huh...

36:00.231 --> 36:02.816
Gian, let's go back to the seats.

36:02.817 --> 36:04.777
Shut up, leave me alone!

36:04.778 --> 36:05.778
Let's just have a drink.

36:05.779 --> 36:07.821
Music, start!

36:12.577 --> 36:15.954
Buttobasu denjarasu!
Am strong and dangerous!

36:16.247 --> 36:18.290
Ore Gian!
I am Gian!

36:18.291 --> 36:21.335
Ittoushou. Addokkoishou! I beat everyone!

36:21.336 --> 36:25.088
What are you doing? Gian is singing!

36:26.299 --> 36:30.803
Even here too, the singing
can break your head!

36:33.097 --> 36:36.892
The only way we have
is to find my adult self!

36:36.893 --> 36:40.604
At this rate, the wedding
party could be ruined!

36:40.605 --> 36:43.857
Nobita, go back quickly!

36:43.858 --> 36:46.401
I can't! I don't know
what greeting speech is!

36:46.402 --> 36:48.612
You just need to talk
about yourself, right?

36:48.613 --> 36:54.493
I can't! We have to find the grown me!

37:03.127 --> 37:08.173
By the way, isn't the greeting speech
"Good Morning" or "Good Afternoon", huh?

37:08.258 --> 37:13.220
In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents.

37:13.221 --> 37:17.849
Be thankful? They Always
get mad when I get 0 points!

37:17.850 --> 37:20.561
Impossible impossible!

37:20.562 --> 37:22.646
You're still talking about that.

37:25.817 --> 37:29.194
He's nowhere.

37:29.195 --> 37:32.155
Oh, yeah, let's just use the search stick.

37:32.156 --> 37:33.490
What is that?

37:33.491 --> 37:37.035
The stick can be a signpost
for the person we want to find.

37:37.036 --> 37:39.580
Heh, very practical.

37:46.337 --> 37:47.045
Why?

37:47.463 --> 37:50.424
Remember when we came here?

37:52.677 --> 37:55.345
Tidying up magic gadgets.

37:59.934 --> 38:04.563
You were in a hurry, I was
panicking too, that's why I missed a lot.

38:04.564 --> 38:07.524
How about we go back to the
original world and take it first?

38:07.525 --> 38:09.443
We don't have time.

38:09.444 --> 38:11.528
Don’t worry.

38:12.405 --> 38:15.574
For example, we leave at 2.

38:17.702 --> 38:21.038
We go back to the origin
and waste 1 hour there.

38:21.039 --> 38:23.206
Keep going back to the future.

38:25.043 --> 38:31.048
When we go out we put it in 5
minutes, so it's 2 past 5 o'clock.

38:31.049 --> 38:34.051
Finally we only waste 5 minutes.

38:34.052 --> 38:36.928
Doraemon, you are so smart.

38:36.929 --> 38:44.728
Not really, ah.

38:44.729 --> 38:46.396
Let's go to the time machine place.

38:46.397 --> 38:47.105
Okay!

39:08.127 --> 39:10.045
Ah! That's right...

39:10.088 --> 39:11.463
There he is!

39:11.506 --> 39:15.926
Geez, just make people
worry. He didn't fall asleep, right?

39:21.599 --> 39:24.017
It is nothing.

39:24.018 --> 39:25.310
Do not tell me...

39:25.311 --> 39:28.230
W-Wait! Where are you going?

39:28.231 --> 39:29.231
Toilet!

39:29.232 --> 39:31.191
Are you dying?

39:31.234 --> 39:32.609
Don't talk stupid like that!

39:37.240 --> 39:38.865
This isn't the one!

39:40.118 --> 39:41.159
Nothing! Nothing!

39:41.160 --> 39:42.244
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

39:42.245 --> 39:43.870
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

39:45.081 --> 39:47.124
It's not anywhere!

39:47.125 --> 39:48.542
What happened?

39:48.543 --> 39:51.128
The time machine was taken by someone!

39:51.921 --> 39:53.130
By whom?

39:53.131 --> 39:57.634
There is only one person who
can drive a time machine today.

40:00.221 --> 40:02.514
Your adult self!

40:04.267 --> 40:07.936
Geez, haphazardly riding time machine.

40:07.937 --> 40:12.274
Did he go to another era?
Your adult self.

40:12.275 --> 40:14.109
But why?

40:14.110 --> 40:17.529
I do not know? He is you!

40:17.530 --> 40:19.823
Don't you have any ideas?

40:19.907 --> 40:23.785
I do not know?
He's me from the future.

40:26.789 --> 40:32.127
Ah... no him, not you.
Nobita is always like that.

40:32.128 --> 40:33.420
Forgive me.

40:36.549 --> 40:37.924
What is wrong?

40:39.844 --> 40:43.472
So we can't go home from this era?

40:46.309 --> 40:50.562
This has happened before.
You can do something, right?

40:50.563 --> 40:55.609
Everything will be all right, right, Doraemon?
Oh yes! What about the Time Belt?

40:55.610 --> 40:57.569
I told you...

40:57.570 --> 40:59.821
Being tidied up.

40:59.822 --> 41:03.283
Everything that could help
us get home was left behind.

41:04.952 --> 41:07.245
How about it, Doraemon?

41:07.246 --> 41:11.958
Well, we have to live
in this era like this...

41:24.430 --> 41:26.932
am hungry.

41:26.933 --> 41:30.769
Surely everyone has come
home from the party venue.

41:32.605 --> 41:35.524
Everything must be messy.

41:35.525 --> 41:40.237
Of the gadgets here, is there anything that
can be used to return home or not, huh?

41:46.869 --> 41:49.996
This is it! We can use this!

41:51.999 --> 41:54.751
"Soul Time Machine"!

41:54.752 --> 41:57.003
"Soul Time Machine"?

41:57.004 --> 42:01.383
This gadget will absorb your soul
and send it to you in a different era.

42:01.384 --> 42:07.305
With this, we can send your
soul to the moment before we left.

42:07.306 --> 42:10.076
At that time, the time
machine was still there, so you

42:10.088 --> 42:12.769
could use the time machine
and come back here, right?

42:14.397 --> 42:17.023
If you try it, you will understand.

42:26.158 --> 42:28.034
Please, yes, Nobita!

42:49.557 --> 42:55.187
Hey, if we do it one more time, don't
you the one who will be nagged by Mother?

42:55.188 --> 42:56.771
Don't talk carelessly!

43:04.947 --> 43:10.160
Nobita! Nobita! Nobita!

43:11.203 --> 43:12.829
Oh, so it's like this, huh?

43:12.830 --> 43:14.122
Are you alright?

43:17.001 --> 43:18.335
It worked!

43:18.336 --> 43:21.046
Are you okay, Nobita?

43:21.047 --> 43:23.298
Yes I'm fine.

43:23.299 --> 43:27.052
I have to hurry and save both of us.

43:27.053 --> 43:29.763
Nobita? Nobita!

43:35.811 --> 43:37.270
Is he all right?

43:39.398 --> 43:42.734
Looks like he's taking a nap.

43:42.735 --> 43:46.529
This is indeed hobby, hahaha.

43:46.530 --> 43:51.451
Ah, what a mess.

43:53.329 --> 43:55.538
Doraemon!

43:57.041 --> 43:58.458
Nobita!

43:58.542 --> 44:00.669
I got the time machine!

44:08.177 --> 44:10.136
Then, let's return it to normal, OK.

44:10.137 --> 44:10.845
Okay.

44:18.938 --> 44:20.730
It worked!

44:20.731 --> 44:23.817
Eh? Me why?

44:23.818 --> 44:26.236
I have two?

44:26.237 --> 44:29.030
This is the future, right?

44:29.031 --> 44:31.700
Stop it. Do not worry about it.

44:31.701 --> 44:33.535
What is it?

44:33.536 --> 44:35.537
Alright, really.

44:36.580 --> 44:40.834
Hey, why am I suddenly in the future?

44:40.835 --> 44:43.795
Why there are two me?

44:43.796 --> 44:46.172
Do not worry about it.

44:46.173 --> 44:49.509
How could that be? Please explain!

44:54.724 --> 44:59.144
Before it got complicated, we
made this Nobita forget about it.

44:59.145 --> 45:01.521
This forgetful stick is useful too, huh.

45:01.522 --> 45:05.275
Eh? Why am I here?

45:05.276 --> 45:07.902
No, don't think about it.

45:12.491 --> 45:16.494
Duh, where is he?

45:17.496 --> 45:24.210
Hah? Me why?
They took me there on a time machine.

45:24.211 --> 45:25.587
Who?

45:26.380 --> 45:28.923
This way, we can rest easy.

45:28.924 --> 45:30.884
Oh, no!

45:30.885 --> 45:34.387
Nobita, go shopping for a bit!

45:34.388 --> 45:35.680
It's Mother!

45:36.724 --> 45:39.184
Hurry up and hide here!

45:44.523 --> 45:47.859
Just recently, mom said too much.

45:49.779 --> 45:51.863
If you're there, please answer...

45:53.657 --> 45:59.871
Well, now... where is
the adult Nobita, huh?

46:13.260 --> 46:15.220
What does it mean?

46:15.221 --> 46:20.058
Nobita who has grown
up may exist in this era.

46:55.052 --> 46:58.054
I have no reason to meet you guys.

46:58.055 --> 47:02.016
Especially after I said
that half a year ago.

47:02.351 --> 47:04.602
Do you want to meet Doraemon?

47:04.603 --> 47:06.813
No, I don't have to.

47:06.814 --> 47:12.485
Doraemon is your friend...
my friend when I was little.

47:12.820 --> 47:16.698
Oh yes!

47:16.699 --> 47:18.533
What's wrong?

47:18.534 --> 47:21.995
By the way, why did you
run away from the wedding?

47:21.996 --> 47:24.414
Don't you like Shizuka anymore?

47:24.415 --> 47:27.750
How could that be!
I like her! I really love her!

47:27.751 --> 47:32.005
Being able to marry
Shizuka is truly a dream.

47:32.006 --> 47:33.381
But?

47:33.465 --> 47:36.718
But what?

47:36.719 --> 47:40.354
Yesterday, after
drinking with friends and I

47:40.366 --> 47:43.850
was alone, I was
thinking about the future.

47:44.727 --> 47:51.524
Then, I got scared
Afraid... Afraid... So scared!

47:51.525 --> 47:52.734
Afraid of what?

47:53.194 --> 47:58.990
Since I'm like this, maybe I
can't make Shizuka happy!

47:58.991 --> 48:01.242
Why are you so weak?

48:01.243 --> 48:06.372
After all, you also know why
Shizuka wanted to marry me, right?

48:06.373 --> 48:10.043
She felt that I was unreliable.

48:10.377 --> 48:15.423
Nobita has not changed at all, huh.

48:15.424 --> 48:20.428
If we let it go, we don't know
what will happen, I get worried.

48:22.514 --> 48:24.015
1 understand.

48:24.433 --> 48:30.897
If she married me for a reason
like that, pity Shizuka herself!

48:32.399 --> 48:35.693
She's too kind.

48:35.694 --> 48:38.404
So that's why you came back to this time?

48:38.405 --> 48:42.116
At that time, I happened
to go to a public toilet.

48:51.627 --> 48:54.045
Why is there a time machine here?

48:55.256 --> 49:01.177
I don't care where the machine
takes me. I just want time to think.

49:01.178 --> 49:04.190
The reason I return
to this time is because

49:04.202 --> 49:07.433
the time machine is
set to return to this time.

49:07.434 --> 49:10.144
So that's the reason you left the wedding?

49:10.145 --> 49:14.315
Don't you think you've
been a bother for everyone?

49:14.316 --> 49:20.071
Don’t worry. When I got more confident, I
would go back to my wedding party, really.

49:20.072 --> 49:21.906
If that's the case, I also know...

49:23.117 --> 49:25.118
Could it be, have you seen it?

49:25.911 --> 49:27.245
I'm not coming back?

49:27.329 --> 49:29.205
That's why we are looking for you.

49:30.291 --> 49:32.292
What happened?

49:32.293 --> 49:33.793
1 don't know!

49:33.836 --> 49:37.297
When the wedding started, you were gone!

49:37.298 --> 49:38.631
Then the wedding?

49:38.632 --> 49:41.259
I replaced you.

49:41.260 --> 49:43.678
But in the middle I also ran away.

49:43.679 --> 49:45.847
The marriage must have gone awry.

49:46.974 --> 49:48.683
What are you doing?

49:48.684 --> 49:49.851
But why?

49:49.852 --> 49:52.353
Suddenly I didn't feel confident, you know.

49:54.231 --> 49:56.232
So sad?

49:56.233 --> 50:00.111
Didn't you come back
because of an accident?

50:01.613 --> 50:05.283
Then what, then?

50:07.786 --> 50:09.746
What kind of accident?!

50:22.718 --> 50:25.636
Can't you forget Nobita?

50:28.223 --> 50:31.225
I don't know why he disappeared suddenly.

50:31.226 --> 50:33.519
Even though he said he liked me.

50:33.520 --> 50:38.691
Seriously, Nobita. If I find
him, I'll beat him black and blue.

50:38.692 --> 50:43.237
But I believe, Nobita
will definitely come back.

50:43.238 --> 50:49.077
And when he comes back, he'll
tell me everything. I believe it.

50:49.161 --> 50:57.794
I'm sorry, Shizuka! But
understand! I'm doing this for you too!

50:57.795 --> 51:00.922
Take out your courage and come back.

51:00.923 --> 51:04.550
I can not. If time has
passed any minute,...

51:04.551 --> 51:10.723
...surely Shizuka would forget
me and meet another man.

51:10.724 --> 51:15.520
If she forgets me, she can be happy.

51:15.521 --> 51:19.065
Then, do you want to
see Shizuka's future again?

51:19.066 --> 51:28.741
No. I don't want to see
Shizuka happy with another man!

51:28.742 --> 51:31.035
How selfish.

51:31.036 --> 51:38.042
But if she turns out to be unhappy,
I don't want to look anymore!

51:38.043 --> 51:39.919
How troublesome this guy is.

51:39.920 --> 51:42.630
He's you after all.

51:42.715 --> 51:46.590
Come to think of it, this is
all because you are usually

51:46.602 --> 51:50.012
just taking naps, which
is why I became like this.

51:50.013 --> 51:53.933
Homework is not even
done, and tests can be 0 only.

51:53.934 --> 51:55.601
Have no confidence anymore.

51:55.602 --> 51:57.937
Don't blame me, please!

51:57.938 --> 52:01.023
Don't fight with yourself!

52:02.109 --> 52:07.196
Ah, if I could go back to this
time, maybe I could fix things up.

52:07.197 --> 52:09.240
If you want, it's easy, really.

52:11.910 --> 52:14.203
"Soul Swapping Ropes"!

52:14.204 --> 52:19.500
If you hold this rope,
you can change bodies.

52:30.721 --> 52:33.014
Why are you so excited?
It's Dangerous, you know.

52:33.015 --> 52:37.185
Besides, when are you coming
back? Just now you still weren't around.

52:37.186 --> 52:41.147
Now, how happy. This feeling and that...

52:42.024 --> 52:43.274
No, nothing.

52:43.317 --> 52:44.734
I'll play first, OK!

52:44.735 --> 52:46.402
Ah, Nobita, the shopping...

52:48.947 --> 52:51.240
It was out suddenly.

52:57.915 --> 53:02.335
Wow, Gian and the others are still kids.

53:02.336 --> 53:05.004
Of course, hahaha.

53:05.672 --> 53:07.799
Hey, how are you?

53:07.800 --> 53:10.343
What are you doing, Nobita? Very arrogant.

53:10.344 --> 53:13.304
Even though you are Nobita,
you really don't hesitate!

53:13.305 --> 53:15.056
I also want to play, please.

53:15.057 --> 53:19.644
Oh, it's the first time you
asked to enter yourself.

53:19.645 --> 53:20.978
Okay, let's try it.

53:21.063 --> 53:24.357
You want to play baseball yourself.

53:24.358 --> 53:28.069
He must have been training hard and finally
become an expert at playing baseball.

53:33.158 --> 53:35.451
Catch it fast!

53:36.370 --> 53:39.705
Nobita, you understand, right?

53:43.502 --> 53:45.253
Batter, out!

53:51.218 --> 53:56.264
Even though he is an adult,
he still hasn't changed at all.

53:56.265 --> 53:58.099
That's right, yes.

54:02.145 --> 54:07.149
Nobita! What does this mean?

54:07.150 --> 54:13.197
You asked yourself to come
in, why did it turn out like this?

54:13.198 --> 54:16.033
Oh right, you're angry.
Of course you get angry.

54:16.118 --> 54:19.245
What did you say?

54:19.246 --> 54:22.832
We lost because of you, you know!

54:23.834 --> 54:26.878
His sense of power
simply couldn't stand it.

54:26.879 --> 54:29.130
Damn it!

54:29.131 --> 54:30.882
No kidding!

54:32.384 --> 54:34.760
This is it! This feeling!

54:34.761 --> 54:39.515
He looks so happy. Adults
just can't be understood.

54:42.019 --> 54:46.772
Well, if he's tired, he can
also go home by himself.

54:47.774 --> 54:53.279
Nobita, with a body like that,
we better enter from the window.

54:53.280 --> 54:55.865
Yes, that’s right.

55:06.043 --> 55:10.421
Hey, finally you guys came
home. Where have you been?

55:10.881 --> 55:11.714
Who are you?

55:11.715 --> 55:18.012
Oh, sorry. I'm from the future
department store. My name is Nakameguro.

55:18.013 --> 55:21.932
Oh, those of you who
like to give us samples.

55:21.933 --> 55:23.559
Why are you here today?

55:23.560 --> 55:30.107
Um, about the soul-swaping
rope I sent here...

55:30.108 --> 55:31.943
I want to take it back.

55:31.944 --> 55:34.695
Hah? Is there any problem?

55:34.696 --> 55:36.197
Of course not!

55:36.198 --> 55:40.660
That's the gadgets that we choose
carefully from the shop right away...

55:40.661 --> 55:43.204
How could there be a problem...

55:44.414 --> 55:47.208
Then why?

55:47.209 --> 55:50.836
Um, that... about that..

55:50.837 --> 55:54.048
Don’t worry. We'll
definitely return it, really.

55:54.049 --> 55:56.592
Oh, thank you very much!

55:56.593 --> 55:58.719
But wait a minute, okay.

55:58.720 --> 56:03.140
We just used the rope for Nobita. If they
have exchanged it back, we will return it.

56:03.141 --> 56:05.476
I'm actually a kid.

56:07.229 --> 56:08.521
So what?

56:08.522 --> 56:12.608
H-H-H-How long has it been
since you guys used that rope?

56:12.609 --> 56:15.569
Hmm... how many minutes has it been?

56:15.779 --> 56:19.407
Almost 1 hour, right?

56:19.491 --> 56:21.867
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-What!

56:21.993 --> 56:22.576
Hah?

56:22.577 --> 56:24.662
This is bad!

56:24.663 --> 56:27.206
Listen carefully.

56:27.207 --> 56:32.628
Actually, the gadget has
a slight error in its design...

56:34.631 --> 56:38.217
After 1 hour, their
consciousness will disappear?

56:38.218 --> 56:40.761
And the memories of both of us...

56:40.762 --> 56:43.929
If you don't quickly
return to your original

56:43.941 --> 56:46.767
self, the memories
will be lost forever.

56:46.768 --> 56:47.977
Nobita!

56:47.978 --> 56:49.145
Come on, quickly!

56:52.357 --> 56:54.650
W-Where are .you going?

56:54.651 --> 56:57.278
First of all we ask this gadget.

56:57.320 --> 57:00.322
Where is the adult Nobita?

57:04.703 --> 57:06.787
Why can't it?

57:06.788 --> 57:10.458
What can I do, we just
search from here first.

57:15.756 --> 57:17.423
Why? What is wrong?

57:17.424 --> 57:21.844
Could it be... Nobita who has grown
up was not returning to the future..

57:21.845 --> 57:24.055
Because he couldn't
go back to the future.,

57:24.473 --> 57:25.556
What do you mean?

57:25.557 --> 57:29.643
If he has lost his memory,
he doesn't know himself, right?

57:31.688 --> 57:37.193
Then, my memories in this
era will also be lost, right?

57:37.194 --> 57:41.197
It's a shame, but there you have it.

57:41.198 --> 57:44.492
I don't want that!

57:44.493 --> 57:46.911
Nobita, wait a minute!

57:56.421 --> 58:01.300
Finally I am free from them,
and Suneo are so stubborn.

58:01.301 --> 58:03.010
Excuse me.

58:04.596 --> 58:08.182
Hey. Excuse me, you said?

58:08.183 --> 58:12.895
Why are you angry?
It was just a little hit.

58:12.896 --> 58:18.442
What's with this kid?
Why are you so arrogant?

58:18.443 --> 58:20.986
Stop it, all of you.

58:23.740 --> 58:25.533
He told us to stop...

58:26.993 --> 58:28.786
You don't know, do you?

58:29.996 --> 58:35.501
Oye, don't you have any
sense of apologies at all?

58:35.502 --> 58:36.627
Y-yes.

58:36.628 --> 58:41.340
What? Do you know what
usually happens at times like this?

58:41.341 --> 58:42.716
N-No.

58:42.717 --> 58:47.471
Don't know? Then I'll tell you.

58:47.472 --> 58:49.515
Listen carefully, you know.

58:51.142 --> 58:55.312
What about compensation money?

58:55.313 --> 58:58.232
Compensation? How much?

58:58.233 --> 58:59.942
Yes, 1000 yen.

58:59.943 --> 59:04.280
Wait, because you are
arrogant, how about 2000 yen?

59:04.281 --> 59:11.162
But this is not coercion, you
know. This is just a suggestion.

59:11.955 --> 59:15.708
Hahaha, you junior high school student.

59:15.709 --> 59:19.420
If that's all I can pay happily.

59:19.421 --> 59:24.300
I always carry paper
money for times like this.

59:24.467 --> 59:26.552
Take this.

59:27.053 --> 59:32.182
Hah? Why is this money
has picture of Osamu Tezuka?

59:32.183 --> 59:36.061
Alas, this is money from the future.

59:36.062 --> 59:38.272
Did you take this money
from the children's bank?

59:38.273 --> 59:41.567
Oye, don't mess around. Bring
out the real thing! Take it out!

59:41.568 --> 59:44.111
Come on, get out the real money!

59:51.286 --> 59:56.790
I can drive this vehicle, you know,
because I'm actually an adult.

59:58.293 --> 1:00:00.044
Go, scooter!

1:00:03.673 --> 1:00:05.633
Okay, scooter!

1:00:05.634 --> 1:00:07.009
Hey, scooter!

1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:14.725
In this era there is no
control of the sound, huh?

1:00:15.685 --> 1:00:20.397
Then, how about we start the punishment?

1:00:20.398 --> 1:00:21.690
Stupid brat...

1:00:28.406 --> 1:00:31.200
My scooter!

1:00:31.201 --> 1:00:33.619
Forgive me!

1:00:33.620 --> 1:00:35.371
Dammit.

1:00:38.124 --> 1:00:39.541
Hah?

1:00:55.684 --> 1:00:57.559
Excuse me!

1:01:12.117 --> 1:01:14.618
Forgive me!

1:01:26.131 --> 1:01:27.381
Shizuka?

1:01:45.984 --> 1:01:48.152
Hey, you...

1:01:53.241 --> 1:01:55.743
Yes, you are interesting too.

1:01:58.997 --> 1:02:04.626
Wait a minute. Come to think
of it, this is your fault, right?

1:02:06.379 --> 1:02:10.507
You're just junior high school kids.
You can't do like this.

1:02:10.508 --> 1:02:13.886
How can you threaten
adult who is older than you.

1:02:15.305 --> 1:02:18.974
How could you be...

1:02:25.148 --> 1:02:28.233
How could you avoid it!

1:02:28.234 --> 1:02:31.153
Eh? Why just now?

1:02:31.613 --> 1:02:36.408
How dare you. I can't forgive!

1:02:37.535 --> 1:02:39.286
Take this!

1:02:41.581 --> 1:02:45.793
It hurts... It's scary...

1:02:45.794 --> 1:02:50.839
Geez.
Where is the adult Nobita?

1:02:53.301 --> 1:02:55.010
Nobita!

1:03:06.106 --> 1:03:07.314
Nobita!

1:03:08.108 --> 1:03:10.067
Nobita!

1:03:23.206 --> 1:03:25.874
It's very dangerous. Let's go down first.

1:03:29.254 --> 1:03:31.713
Nobita, are you okay?

1:03:34.843 --> 1:03:37.845
Who are you?

1:03:37.846 --> 1:03:42.224
It's me, Doraemon! Just hold on!

1:03:43.810 --> 1:03:49.106
That is true. I'm just stunned a little...

1:03:49.107 --> 1:03:51.316
Your consciousness starts to
lose little by little! Nobita, hang on!

1:03:51.317 --> 1:03:53.610
Hang in there, Nobita!

1:03:55.697 --> 1:03:57.322
Don’t worry.

1:04:00.618 --> 1:04:02.870
I will definitely restore
my future with Shizuka.

1:04:03.830 --> 1:04:04.830
Nobita...

1:04:09.711 --> 1:04:12.004
We don't have time. Come on, quickly!

1:04:12.005 --> 1:04:15.507
You guys calm down, please.

1:04:15.508 --> 1:04:20.012
It's your nature that makes us nervous!

1:04:20.013 --> 1:04:22.139
Stop bothering weak people.

1:04:23.766 --> 1:04:26.393
Who are you?

1:04:26.394 --> 1:04:29.521
The kids in this town are all so arrogant.

1:04:30.732 --> 1:04:34.026
If you don't step aside
it can be dangerous.

1:04:34.027 --> 1:04:35.861
Shizuka, run away!

1:04:45.330 --> 1:04:47.372
Why?

1:04:47.373 --> 1:04:49.625
Get away from Shizuka!

1:04:49.626 --> 1:04:51.126
Nobita!

1:04:53.254 --> 1:04:55.214
You are!

1:04:59.177 --> 1:05:00.928
Hah? Again, again...

1:05:02.388 --> 1:05:03.931
My head is dizzy...

1:05:03.932 --> 1:05:06.016
It felt like he was so hard to hit!

1:05:06.017 --> 1:05:09.144
That's not the case...

1:05:09.145 --> 1:05:11.313
You can't run away!

1:05:14.901 --> 1:05:15.526
Gian?

1:05:16.236 --> 1:05:19.696
So you ran off here, didn't you, Nobita?

1:05:19.697 --> 1:05:21.490
You!

1:05:32.669 --> 1:05:35.671
If this toy is damaged, you
have to compensate, you know.

1:05:35.672 --> 1:05:37.172
Suneo!

1:05:38.633 --> 1:05:40.634
Who are you?

1:05:42.011 --> 1:05:48.058
The only ones allowed to
beat Nobita are us, you know!

1:05:56.234 --> 1:05:57.943
Just remember, yes!

1:06:04.325 --> 1:06:06.243
You're great too, Nobita.

1:06:07.203 --> 1:06:11.957
You are so sloppy, huh.
Even though you can't fight.

1:06:12.917 --> 1:06:17.462
Did 1 protect Shizuka?

1:06:19.924 --> 1:06:22.134
Hooray!

1:06:28.349 --> 1:06:31.435
Nobita? Why? Just hold on!

1:06:31.436 --> 1:06:34.021
Nobita got on a scooter earlier and fell.

1:06:34.022 --> 1:06:34.813
What?

1:06:34.814 --> 1:06:36.606
Maybe he hit his head.

1:06:36.607 --> 1:06:41.612
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!

1:06:42.822 --> 1:06:45.324
Hang in there, Nobita!

1:06:46.034 --> 1:06:48.035
Don’t worry.

1:06:48.036 --> 1:06:52.205
We will surely find my adult myself.

1:06:52.206 --> 1:07:00.213
I will protect my future with Shizuka...

1:07:00.214 --> 1:07:03.091
Nobita! Ah, Nobita!

1:07:03.092 --> 1:07:07.596
How about this? At this rate,
Nobita will lose his memory!

1:07:07.597 --> 1:07:10.015
Where is the adult Nobita? Damnit!

1:07:11.893 --> 1:07:17.105
How about this? Is there
no gadget that can be used?

1:07:17.106 --> 1:07:18.273
Oh yes! There is this!

1:07:20.026 --> 1:07:22.235
Go to where adult Nobita is!

1:07:24.906 --> 1:07:29.451
He's not an adult Nobita currently...

1:07:29.452 --> 1:07:35.707
Ah, what should I do? What should I do?

1:07:36.542 --> 1:07:38.126
Wait a minute.

1:07:38.127 --> 1:07:41.671
If I say more carefully, will it work?

1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:47.511
Go to little Nobita's place
where there is an adult Nobita!

1:07:55.770 --> 1:07:58.105
Nobita! Nobita!

1:07:58.106 --> 1:08:00.399
Oye, hang on, Nobita!

1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:02.859
We've called an ambulance!

1:08:03.611 --> 1:08:05.112
Hooray, it worked!

1:08:08.991 --> 1:08:10.951
Who is it?

1:08:10.952 --> 1:08:14.705
Do not ask.
Just put this rope on that Nobita.

1:08:14.706 --> 1:08:15.706
Okay!

1:08:18.418 --> 1:08:20.252
He can't go back.

1:08:22.755 --> 1:08:24.172
What happened?

1:08:24.173 --> 1:08:27.801
Just try it first!
Don't say you can't!

1:08:27.802 --> 1:08:30.429
But the mechanism was set up like this...

1:08:30.430 --> 1:08:35.683
I said try it first! If Nobita doesn't
come back, I'll crush you to pieces!

1:08:35.684 --> 1:08:37.185
Even if you say so...

1:08:37.437 --> 1:08:42.149
Do not give up!
If we don't try it, we won't know, right?

1:08:42.150 --> 1:08:45.944
A-Alright. Geez, using the
rope is very rough, though.

1:08:48.990 --> 1:08:53.034
See. The time has been
too long, so he can't go back.

1:08:53.035 --> 1:08:54.035
Shut up!

1:08:54.996 --> 1:08:56.329
Hold on...

1:09:00.710 --> 1:09:02.460
I can't do it...

1:09:03.171 --> 1:09:05.046
What happened?

1:09:05.047 --> 1:09:08.424
Nobita, do you want this?

1:09:08.425 --> 1:09:13.013
Your memories of Gian, Suneo,
and Shizuka will be lost, you know.

1:09:13.014 --> 1:09:15.307
Really? You're kidding, right?

1:09:15.308 --> 1:09:16.475
You're kidding, right?

1:09:17.101 --> 1:09:21.855
Nobita, you will forget me too.

1:09:21.856 --> 1:09:24.775
Do you want that?

1:09:38.372 --> 1:09:41.875
I do not want!

1:10:00.436 --> 1:10:02.562
Oh, It's moving!

1:10:03.940 --> 1:10:05.524
We made it in time.

1:10:06.818 --> 1:10:08.109
Nobita!

1:10:46.899 --> 1:10:49.568
Nobita! Nobita!

1:10:52.405 --> 1:10:54.155
Shizuka?

1:10:56.617 --> 1:10:59.744
Geez! Nobita, you idiot!

1:10:59.829 --> 1:11:03.248
Why are you fighting,
even though you can't?

1:11:03.249 --> 1:11:05.333
Don't force it.

1:11:05.334 --> 1:11:08.753
Let it be what you are!

1:11:23.144 --> 1:11:25.228
Are you alright?

1:11:25.229 --> 1:11:29.399
Yes. I think I can go home.

1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:32.027
Yes. Looks like I've been able
to go back to my Shizuka's place.

1:11:36.824 --> 1:11:41.161
But before returning to the future,
there is one place I want to visit.

1:11:41.162 --> 1:11:46.791
Because I have to make a
speech at the wedding, right?

1:11:46.792 --> 1:11:48.084
Could it be, you want to go to...

1:11:48.085 --> 1:11:49.669
Yes, our

1:11:49.670 --> 1:11:51.129
Yes, our birthday!

1:11:51.130 --> 1:11:57.010
That's right. I also want to make sure that
I really am the child of this family,...

1:11:57.011 --> 1:11:59.596
...and why they gave me the name Nobita.

1:11:59.597 --> 1:12:01.556
I also want to know.

1:12:01.557 --> 1:12:05.936
Okay, okay. It's been this
far, I just follow your wishes.

1:12:16.530 --> 1:12:19.658
Wow, this was my house 10 years ago!

1:12:21.702 --> 1:12:24.245
At that time, this room
was still Father's room.

1:12:24.246 --> 1:12:27.165
Looks like we've stolen her hobby room.

1:12:27.166 --> 1:12:30.543
There are no blisters on the pillars yet.

1:12:30.544 --> 1:12:33.421
But there's nobody here.

1:12:33.422 --> 1:12:36.883
If my parents are not here, how am I born?

1:12:36.884 --> 1:12:40.387
Could it be that you are
really an adopted child?

1:12:40.388 --> 1:12:43.348
See. That is right!

1:12:43.349 --> 1:12:46.142
Calm down, they must be in the hospital.

1:12:46.811 --> 1:12:48.436
Where is she? Where is she?

1:12:48.437 --> 1:12:51.690
Oh, Dad! 10 years younger!

1:12:51.691 --> 1:12:54.442
From my point of view,
he's 25 years younger!

1:12:55.695 --> 1:12:57.570
Still like a young man.

1:12:57.571 --> 1:13:00.365
Who are you?

1:13:00.449 --> 1:13:02.742
You forgot your own son!

1:13:02.743 --> 1:13:06.329
Do not say like that!
You weren't born here!

1:13:06.330 --> 1:13:10.834
Excuse me, it looks like
we are at the wrong house.

1:13:13.337 --> 1:13:15.130
What is that?

1:13:15.131 --> 1:13:19.342
Instead of thinking about
that, where is the baby, huh?

1:13:19.343 --> 1:13:23.013
Even though I was home early from work.

1:13:24.223 --> 1:13:27.600
Ah, where? Where? Here, huh?

1:13:29.228 --> 1:13:31.229
Isn't he at the hospital?

1:13:31.230 --> 1:13:33.022
Oh yes! That is true!

1:13:35.526 --> 1:13:37.527
In such a hurry.

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:40.864
By the way, where is the hospital?

1:13:40.865 --> 1:13:44.534
Wait a minute! We're coming too!

1:13:49.206 --> 1:13:52.959
Congratulations, sir! Your son is born.

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.753
Oh, thanks for the food!

1:13:54.754 --> 1:13:57.255
No, I mean... thank you.

1:13:57.256 --> 1:13:58.423
Come here.

1:13:58.424 --> 1:14:01.801
Huh, I'm so excited.

1:14:01.802 --> 1:14:06.181
I'm excited too.
What type of baby that be?

1:14:06.182 --> 1:14:09.768
Must be a cute kid like us.

1:14:09.769 --> 1:14:13.897
Hahaha, it's better not
to get your hopes up.

1:14:15.900 --> 1:14:16.858
Tama-Chan!

1:14:19.528 --> 1:14:22.906
Hello, this is Dad, son!

1:14:23.783 --> 1:14:27.911
How cute he's. This is my son, right?

1:14:27.912 --> 1:14:30.413
Hello, my baby!

1:14:30.414 --> 1:14:33.249
1 want to see too!

1:14:34.001 --> 1:14:35.668
Is this me?

1:14:35.669 --> 1:14:38.630
Why are there wrinkles like
this? Looks like a monkey!

1:14:39.673 --> 1:14:42.383
What do you mean monkey, huh?

1:14:44.929 --> 1:14:48.139
That was shocking. Don't be that angry too.

1:14:48.140 --> 1:14:50.391
He's mad because you
weren't being polite, right?

1:14:50.392 --> 1:14:53.686
After all, isn't baby Nobita cute?

1:14:53.687 --> 1:14:59.234
No! Not cute at all!
Surely that baby is not me!

1:14:59.235 --> 1:15:02.195
Newborn babies are like that, you know.

1:15:02.196 --> 1:15:04.531
Who are those kids?

1:15:04.532 --> 1:15:06.950
They've been following me from earlier.

1:15:06.951 --> 1:15:09.744
I wonder what their parents look like.

1:15:11.122 --> 1:15:14.499
Where's my mom, by the way?
She should be with you, right?

1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:17.836
Oh, she said she wanted
to tell our ancestors.

1:15:17.837 --> 1:15:19.629
She must be very happy, huh?

1:15:19.630 --> 1:15:23.508
Yes, she couldn't stop crying.

1:15:24.510 --> 1:15:26.344
This bear?

1:15:26.345 --> 1:15:28.721
Mother's gift for this child.

1:15:29.849 --> 1:15:31.724
Too fast, right?

1:15:37.314 --> 1:15:41.401
By the way, what about this child's name?

1:15:41.402 --> 1:15:43.486
I thought about it carefully.

1:15:43.487 --> 1:15:45.572
What is that?

1:15:45.573 --> 1:15:48.867
Tadaaa, I'm telling you, yes.

1:15:48.868 --> 1:15:51.119
Nobita Nobi!

1:15:52.121 --> 1:15:53.830
Nobita?

1:15:53.831 --> 1:15:55.456
Nice name, right?

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.918
I want a cooler name.

1:15:58.919 --> 1:16:01.296
They should listen to our hopes, please.

1:16:01.297 --> 1:16:04.257
Stop it, stop it. You'll be
scolded again, you know!

1:16:04.258 --> 1:16:07.635
The meaning of the
name? Of course there is!

1:16:07.636 --> 1:16:13.725
I want this child to
grow up healthy always.

1:16:13.726 --> 1:16:15.768
What a nice name.

1:16:16.645 --> 1:16:18.438
Nobita Nobi.

1:16:21.192 --> 1:16:22.525
I like that name.

1:16:23.777 --> 1:16:27.113
So they thought about the name carefully.

1:16:30.284 --> 1:16:33.328
I want to raise him to be a good boy.

1:16:34.413 --> 1:16:37.040
He must be a good boy!

1:16:37.041 --> 1:16:41.044
If he looks like you,
he will be doing well.

1:16:41.045 --> 1:16:45.548
If he looks like you, he
will be good at sports.

1:16:45.549 --> 1:16:46.424
Truly.

1:16:46.425 --> 1:16:49.636
You only looks alike in the
weak spots of your parents.

1:16:49.637 --> 1:16:51.220
What a chatterbox, ah!

1:16:51.931 --> 1:16:56.434
Is he going to be a professor?
Or a baseball player?

1:16:56.435 --> 1:16:57.977
He can be a painter too.

1:16:59.605 --> 1:17:02.357
Painter, sculptor, musician.

1:17:02.358 --> 1:17:03.691
Anything is okay.

1:17:03.692 --> 1:17:06.945
As long as he is of
use to those around him.

1:17:06.946 --> 1:17:09.948
Care for others and be brave.

1:17:09.949 --> 1:17:14.744
A cheerful child, a real boy,
strong, fair, and handsome.

1:17:16.705 --> 1:17:21.000
Um, don't get your hopes up, anyway.

1:17:21.001 --> 1:17:23.670
He's not that great kid, really.

1:17:23.671 --> 1:17:28.508
From earlier you kept bothering me.
Do you have a grudge against my son?!

1:17:35.015 --> 1:17:36.849
Father and mother

1:17:36.850 --> 1:17:38.810
They are very happy.

1:17:38.811 --> 1:17:41.729
They are full of hope.

1:17:47.611 --> 1:17:50.113
Let's go back to the future.

1:18:06.046 --> 1:18:08.131
Finally we are back.

1:18:14.388 --> 1:18:16.431
Oh, come here.

1:18:16.432 --> 1:18:17.181
What? What?

1:18:17.224 --> 1:18:18.182
Why?

1:18:19.935 --> 1:18:21.227
Look at that.

1:18:22.271 --> 1:18:27.233
In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents.

1:18:27.234 --> 1:18:33.322
Be thankful? They always get
mad when I get 0 points! I can not!

1:18:34.324 --> 1:18:36.534
You're still thinking about it.

1:18:36.535 --> 1:18:38.786
To run like that...

1:18:41.832 --> 1:18:43.332
Come on, quickly.

1:18:43.333 --> 1:18:48.921
Um... sorry, yeah. But can you go alone?

1:18:49.798 --> 1:18:53.926
We still have important
promise that we must keep.

1:18:53.927 --> 1:18:55.636
Right, Doraemon?

1:18:56.805 --> 1:19:01.017
Oh, I see?
If so, this is goodbye.

1:19:06.106 --> 1:19:07.982
Thank you for finding me.

1:19:07.983 --> 1:19:09.942
Thank you for finding me.:

1:19:09.943 --> 1:19:13.863
Your future is mine too.:

1:19:13.947 --> 1:19:17.408
Oh yes! This.

1:19:21.705 --> 1:19:22.705
This...

1:19:24.708 --> 1:19:25.541
See you later, yes!

1:19:28.837 --> 1:19:31.714
By the way, what is that important promise?

1:19:50.526 --> 1:19:53.444
Thanks for waiting!

1:19:56.031 --> 1:19:58.825
Thank you!

1:20:00.577 --> 1:20:06.916
Everyone, my healthy
friend, Nobita, is back!

1:20:06.917 --> 1:20:10.086
Thank goodness, we survived.

1:20:10.087 --> 1:20:11.671
Thank you, Nobita!

1:20:12.881 --> 1:20:14.799
Really grateful!

1:20:15.634 --> 1:20:17.426
But it took him a long time to come back.

1:20:19.012 --> 1:20:21.097
I've bought time for you, you know.

1:20:34.111 --> 1:20:35.820
Welcome back.

1:20:36.613 --> 1:20:39.407
I am back.
You must be worried, right?

1:20:39.408 --> 1:20:40.950
Not really.

1:20:40.951 --> 1:20:43.744
Not at all.

1:20:44.955 --> 1:20:51.586
Then, let us hear the Greeting
remarks from our groom once again.

1:20:52.713 --> 1:20:54.046
The rain has stopped.

1:21:10.189 --> 1:21:13.482
Everyone, good afternoon. I am Nobita Nobi.

1:21:13.483 --> 1:21:15.276
We know already!

1:21:17.321 --> 1:21:20.990
At first, I didn't like this name.

1:21:21.700 --> 1:21:23.784
Because it seems slow and stupid.

1:21:24.995 --> 1:21:30.144
But when I was born, my
parents gave me this name

1:21:30.156 --> 1:21:35.421
in the hope that I will
continue to grow.healthily.

1:21:35.422 --> 1:21:39.008
Now, I really like this name.

1:21:39.510 --> 1:21:42.053
It's like he was there and saw
everything that was going on, huh?

1:21:42.888 --> 1:21:46.265
I was raised by my
parents and my grandma...

1:21:46.266 --> 1:21:51.229
And also my grandma, they
took care of me with great love.

1:21:51.688 --> 1:21:57.818
When I was a kid and came home
crying, Grandma always comforted me.

1:21:58.403 --> 1:22:03.699
And Grandma always believed what I said.

1:22:04.535 --> 1:22:10.540
When I got zero points,
Mom always scolded me.

1:22:10.541 --> 1:22:15.628
And Father taught me
to try to reach my dreams.

1:22:16.129 --> 1:22:22.802
I grew up with your love.

1:22:22.803 --> 1:22:25.680
And Shizuka's father...

1:22:26.515 --> 1:22:33.062
You once said that I am a person who
understands the pain of other people.

1:22:33.063 --> 1:22:39.026
It's because my family taught me that.

1:22:40.946 --> 1:22:46.575
Maybe I did not become the child my
parents and grandma expected me to be.

1:22:46.576 --> 1:22:55.960
Maybe they expected me to
become a painter or a baseball player.

1:22:55.961 --> 1:22:57.962
Wow, their hopes all failed!

1:22:58.463 --> 1:23:00.006
You're so loud!

1:23:03.844 --> 1:23:07.638
But I can say this one thing.

1:23:07.639 --> 1:23:12.101
I've been raised by a wonderful family.

1:23:12.102 --> 1:23:16.606
Because of that, even
though it can't be expected,

1:23:16.607 --> 1:23:21.110
.. I want to make a
warm family with Shizuka.

1:23:21.111 --> 1:23:25.656
In this regard, I am very confident.

1:23:25.657 --> 1:23:35.333
If I do that, I feel I have returned the
services of my parents and grandma.

1:23:36.126 --> 1:23:39.128
Mother, father.

1:23:39.129 --> 1:23:42.131
Shizuka's Father and Mother.

1:23:42.132 --> 1:23:45.134
We will follow in your footsteps;

1:23:46.428 --> 1:23:47.720
Shizuka.

1:23:48.972 --> 1:23:53.684
Let's make a happy family like them.

1:24:44.861 --> 1:24:46.070
What is wrong?

1:24:49.074 --> 1:24:52.076
No, nothing.

1:25:10.387 --> 1:25:11.846
Are you going home already?

1:25:12.806 --> 1:25:17.226
Grandma has seen enough.

1:25:29.531 --> 1:25:33.743
Looks like Mom was here just now.

1:25:33.744 --> 1:25:35.244
Oh, you feel so too?

1:25:36.455 --> 1:25:41.000
It's -possible that Mom actually came here.

1:26:00.896 --> 1:26:01.937
Nobita.

1:26:03.023 --> 1:26:05.024
Your earlier was fake, right?

1:26:06.276 --> 1:26:09.653
That... er...

1:26:09.654 --> 1:26:13.032
Even though you are better off just you.

1:26:13.033 --> 1:26:16.535
You always hide your own sadness...

1:26:16.536 --> 1:26:22.249
But in the end, you must be
helped by Doraemon again, right?

1:26:28.924 --> 1:26:32.176
I came back for the sake of my happiness.

1:26:32.594 --> 1:26:37.223
With that, Shizuka must also be happy.

1:26:39.893 --> 1:26:41.435
Very good!

1:26:44.356 --> 1:26:46.440
Oh yes. This.

1:26:49.069 --> 1:26:52.196
I want to start all over again.

1:27:44.249 --> 1:27:46.834
OK, we're going home?

1:27:47.711 --> 1:27:48.711
Nobita,

1:27:49.713 --> 1:27:53.674
You really did fulfill Grandma's dream.

1:27:55.176 --> 1:27:56.510
Thank you.

1:27:57.262 --> 1:28:02.141
You're welcome. I'm also grateful for being
able to keep my promise to my grandmother.

1:28:02.142 --> 1:28:07.146
Yes. Grandma is really very happy.

1:28:08.481 --> 1:28:09.523
But...

1:28:10.483 --> 1:28:11.275
But...

1:28:12.152 --> 1:28:17.323
In order to keep Grandma's promise...

1:28:18.742 --> 1:28:30.044
You must have suffered a lot
just to keep Grandma's promise.

1:28:30.045 --> 1:28:35.049
That whiny little Nobita...

1:28:36.009 --> 1:28:39.929
To end up being a good boy like this.

1:28:41.514 --> 1:28:49.229
That's what made Grandma the happiest.

1:28:50.482 --> 1:28:51.649
Grandma!

1:28:53.568 --> 1:28:54.943
I'm not like that.

1:28:56.196 --> 1:28:59.615
I'm a stupid coward,

1:28:59.616 --> 1:29:01.575
also a crybaby...

1:29:02.744 --> 1:29:09.041
But Nobita has real strength, right?

1:29:10.585 --> 1:29:19.093
Shizuka must know that too,
that's why she became your bride.

1:29:19.094 --> 1:29:21.220
Grandma!

1:29:21.221 --> 1:29:28.352
Oh, oh, you're back to
being little Nobita again.

1:29:31.106 --> 1:29:33.399
Can I come again?

1:29:35.318 --> 1:29:38.696
You can come no matter how many times.

1:29:38.697 --> 1:29:43.450
Grandma will be waiting for you here.

1:30:03.263 --> 1:30:07.016
So the time machine can drive itself, huh?

1:30:07.017 --> 1:30:11.103
Yes. I'm tired of driving today.

1:30:11.104 --> 1:30:16.900
So many things happened.
It's you, really.

1:30:17.235 --> 1:30:20.237
Hehehe. Sorry, yes, Doraemon.

1:30:20.238 --> 1:30:22.364
Are you really sorry?

1:30:22.365 --> 1:30:23.991
Of course! It's true!

1:30:24.033 --> 1:30:26.160
Really?

1:30:29.497 --> 1:30:31.790
How stubborn, huh!

1:30:35.295 --> 1:30:38.297
Oh, damn it! Forgetful Stick!

1:30:38.298 --> 1:30:43.218
This is bad! Nobita forgot his memory.

1:30:43.219 --> 1:30:45.596
This is really bad, right?

1:30:47.223 --> 1:30:48.515
But wait!

1:30:49.309 --> 1:30:54.313
Nobita, Nobita, Nobita...

1:30:58.651 --> 1:31:04.031
Doraemon?
Why am I riding a time machine?

1:31:04.032 --> 1:31:07.148
You see, we have just
experienced something very

1:31:07.160 --> 1:31:10.287
troublesome, but also
something very beautiful.-

1:31:10.288 --> 1:31:12.956
Eh? What is that? What
is that? Please, tell me!

1:31:12.999 --> 1:31:15.209
When you grow up, you will know.

1:31:15.335 --> 1:31:17.085
Until then, it's better if you don't Know.

1:31:17.253 --> 1:31:20.756
Why is that? What happened?

1:31:20.757 --> 1:31:23.008
How much do you remember?

1:31:23.009 --> 1:31:27.262
Hmm, we met Grandma...

1:31:27.305 --> 1:31:30.724
Oh yes! We have to show
my .bride to Grandma!

1:31:30.725 --> 1:31:33.352
Take it easy. Everything is finished.

1:31:33.603 --> 1:31:38.357
Eh? What does it mean? Tell me please!

1:31:38.399 --> 1:31:41.985
How stubborn, huh! I won't tell!

1:31:41.986 --> 1:31:45.155
