3
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,666
What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,250
These people have paid to come and watch.

5
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,708
-Where do you think you are going?
-Hey, man, we're waiting for you.

6
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,208
-Come on, sing a song.
-No please, I'll handle it.

7
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,958
This girl paid to come and listen to
a song by Louw… Louw… Louw van Lier.

8
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,750
Keep quiet, please.

9
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,208
I don't give a damn who he thinks he is.

10
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,208
Just give us a song.

11
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,791
No.

12
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,791
I'll send you to your grave!

13
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,250
Who do you think you are?

14
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:53,458
Everybody told me
Louw van Lier is a nobody.

15
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:59,333
But for Karien's sake,
I decided to give you another chance.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,583
Now I see they're right. You are a nobody.

17
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,208
And don't think you can
ever come back here!

18
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,833
Nobody… will give you a chance again!

19
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,791
Because nobody
will ever remember you!

20
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,916
Matewis!

21
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,208
The boxes.

22
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,250
Matewis!

23
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,375
Sorry, did you… leave it, I will.

24
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,541
Perfect timing, as always!

25
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,708
I'm done.

26
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,708
Why didn't you mention
anything about Louw coming?

27
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,375
I only found out this morning.

28
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,458
This morning?

29
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,583
I told him our home will always be open.

30
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,166
He's my brother, Matewis.

31
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,250
He grew up here.

32
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,458
What about our meeting with Wim?

33
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,500
You'll just have to handle it on your own.

34
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,708
Alright?

35
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,333
I have an appointment with the bank.

36
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,250
I'll first have to hear what they say.

37
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,166
You know it's not going
to help the situation.

38
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,250
Sell me the place, you won't
get another offer like this.

39
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,000
Matewis…

40
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,791
I think the time has come for you
to accept that you're not a farmer.

41
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,875
Is everything okay? I was getting worried.

42
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,958
<i>I'm seated in the passage</i>
<i>Where the sun can sing</i>

43
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:48,000
<i>It's quiet in the corner and it's cold</i>

44
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,541
<i>Can you see what the wind</i>
<i>And the rain does to me</i>

45
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,083
<i>Sun catcher</i>

46
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,125
<i>I'm asking you nicely</i>

47
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,875
<i>Let it shine for me again</i>

48
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,958
Can I help you carry anything?

49
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,291
Your guitar?

50
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,791
No, it's not necessary, thank you.

51
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,250
Let's go inside.

52
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,250
I thought you might like
to be in your old room.

53
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,500
We just use it as a storeroom.

54
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,750
I think there will be a
few shocked faces in town

55
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,833
when they see how much you resemble him.

56
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,333
Almost as if his ghost
is roaming the streets.

57
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,541
Remember when I took this one?

58
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,416
It was the day I think we all knew.

59
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,583
I don't take photos anymore.

60
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,416
What's more to see?

61
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,250
It's always the same.

62
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,333
Nothing changes.

63
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,916
It would probably help
me if I ever go blind.

64
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,791
But luckily my brother is here.

65
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,208
So finally we will have some excitement.

66
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,125
Matewis is somewhere on the farm.

67
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,500
We had to lay off some people.

68
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,916
So he will probably try to convince
you to help him with a few things.

69
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,208
Thank you.

70
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,291
That I can stay here.

71
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,416
Of course.

72
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,125
I told you so, anytime.

73
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,000
It's good that you came.

74
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,583
I've missed you.

75
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,041
-You were unbelievable!
-Thank you.

76
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,333
There you go. Excuse me.

77
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,875
I'll be back.

78
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,750
Hey, what's wrong?

79
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,833
Aren't you excited?

80
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,166
So now you have everything
you've always wanted.

81
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,416
What I wanted?

82
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,708
I thought it was what we wanted?

83
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,208
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

84
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,708
You…

85
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,041
should be proud of me.

86
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,750
Of course, I'm proud.

87
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,083
So what then?

88
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,125
Sometimes I think
you don't really love me.

89
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,250
Did you have to bring that up now?

90
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,333
Hmm?

91
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,458
Can't you… I…

92
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,666
I've just had the biggest
show of my career.

93
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,208
How…

94
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,583
How can you be so selfish?

95
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,916
-Yes, I am selfish.
-Yes.

96
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,250
I'm so sorry Louw, you were unbelievable.

97
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,000
I can see you are so happy.

98
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,291
Now you have everything
you've always wanted.

99
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Nothing!

100
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,625
Typical!

101
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,291
-You know what?
-What?

102
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,875
You will never do it!

103
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,083
I really thought that tonight
would be the perfect night.

104
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,958
-So I…
-Louw! Louw!

105
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,500
I'll… I'll be there now. Hold on a moment.

106
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,875
Karien.

107
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,375
Hi.

108
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,166
I wanted to wake you but I
thought you could do with the rest.

109
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,416
I forgot my phone.

110
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,083
I was afraid you'd try to phone.

111
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,541
Remember Dad never allowed
us to ever touch that cup?

112
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,666
I'm still too afraid to touch it.

113
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,041
Have you eaten? I can make you something.

114
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,166
No. Thank you. I…

115
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,041
I'm just going for a walk.

116
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,333
I can go with you.

117
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,916
Come, come, come boys.

118
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,208
Hurry up! Hurry up!

119
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,916
We don't have the whole day.

120
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,625
Can you lift it?

121
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,500
Louw!

122
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,250
Come and help!

123
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,875
Come help, please! We
still have a lot of work to do.

124
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,916
The guys don't know what they're doing!

125
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,291
Let's go, let's go. Come on. That's it.

126
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,458
Yes! Yes! Yes!

127
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes!

128
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,500
Thank you.

129
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,416
Porridge, huh? Porridge.

130
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,916
Thanks. There's something
else I want you to do.

131
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come.

132
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,291
Sandra, this is a surprise.

133
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,666
-I haven't seen you in a while.
-Sorry, I did knock, but I…

134
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,916
Is Louw here?

135
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,250
Oh, I saw him in town yesterday.

136
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,833
Well, he drove past the school.

137
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,541
He went for a walk.

138
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,875
Hopefully, he doesn't run into Matewis,
else who knows what time he'll be back.

139
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, I brought him something.

140
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,708
Well it's for all of you
but I remember he likes it.

141
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:06,958
Banana bread.

142
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,708
It was always his favourite.

143
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,708
You are welcome to wait a while.

144
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm just clearing up.

145
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,375
No, I must get back.
I have a class just now.

146
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,666
I'll tell Louw you were here.

147
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,791
Okay.

148
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,208
Tell him to pop in when he gets a chance.

149
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,166
The children will be so excited

150
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,583
to see a real musician for a change.

151
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,416
Bye.

152
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,250
It looks like it's all coming back to you.

153
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,208
A few years ago…

154
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,958
we almost lost everything.

155
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,833
See those trees over on that side…

156
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,458
that's where the fire started.

157
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,166
I really feel sorry for that little guy.

158
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,625
His father is Wim Cloete.

159
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,208
Wim thinks he can own this whole town.

160
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,875
He owns the farm next to us
and he has a few other farms.

161
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,250
We…

162
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,791
Marie…

163
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,833
sold a section of the farm to his father.

164
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,208
Oh.

165
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,875
I didn't know.

166
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,958
Nothing is going on there,
just a few dilapidated buildings.

167
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:47,083
We've been using it for a couple
of years to store some broken stuff.

168
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,500
Marie and I

169
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,291
used to go there and shoot my Dad's gun.

170
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,916
How's my sister doing?

171
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,875
You know her.

172
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,791
She has a heart of gold.

173
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,666
She always makes time for everybody.

174
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,041
She is helping out at
one of the shops in town.

175
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,041
Are you finished?

176
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,375
-Hmm.
-Can we go?

177
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,875
Did you bring my guitar in?

178
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,583
I…

179
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,541
It was outside and I…

180
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,500
Did you go through my clothing?

181
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,333
I just unpacked it.

182
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,208
I thought it might be good if
somebody took care of you.

183
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,333
I am not a child! I don't need
anybody to take care of me!

184
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,500
Would you like me to take it back outside?

185
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,958
I'll add it to my list of a million
things I must do tomorrow.

186
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,375
Is the food ready yet?

187
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,958
It smells amazing.

188
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,541
Yes, you can sit so long.

189
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,625
Leave my stuff alone.

190
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,500
<i>I'm longing for you</i>

191
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,125
<i>For the wind that wraps its arms around me</i>

192
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,500
<i>That's how I'm longing</i>
<i>As the sun and the moon and the wind</i>

193
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,333
<i>And the clouds pass me by</i>

194
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,291
<i>Are you longing for me too?</i>

195
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,291
<i>In the distant land where you live</i>

196
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:35,375
<i>And are you longing</i>
<i>As the sun and the moon and the wind</i>

197
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,750
<i>And the clouds pass you by</i>

198
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:49,916
<i>That's how I'm longing</i>
<i>As the sun and the moon and the wind</i>

199
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,416
<i>And the clouds pass me…</i>

200
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,625
Hey!

201
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,958
Sorry, Sir.

202
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,250
I… I didn't know you were there.

203
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,750
No, no, don't worry. I just…

204
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,250
I just got a fright.

205
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,625
I'm Louw.

206
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,833
Was it… Was it you that was singing?

207
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,791
Uh, no… No, Sir.

208
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,500
S… S… Sorry I bothered you.

209
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,666
No, you, you didn't…

210
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,708
Your coach phoned me.

211
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,416
You didn't go to practice again.

212
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,333
Do you want to disappoint me?

213
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,666
Venter, look at your father
when he's talking to you.

214
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,541
And that?

215
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,333
Did you get into a fight again?

216
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,916
N… N… No.

217
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,291
No, Dad.

218
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,416
What have I always told you?

219
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,916
There are only two types
of people in this world.

220
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,416
The hunters and the prey.

221
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,250
The weak ones.

222
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,666
Those who are left behind.

223
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,708
And we…

224
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,083
We are never the prey.

225
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,291
I'll deliver the package if you like.

226
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,458
If through it all, you get the time

227
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,625
please drop that off as well.

228
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,791
Okay, it's fine.

229
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,458
Excuse me… Do you need help, Sir?

230
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Louw!

231
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,208
Louw.

232
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,916
My word! Please to meet you.

233
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,041
Henk.

234
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,208
Marie has told me so much about you.

235
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,416
It's great that you're back in town.

236
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,875
Hopefully, we'll get a
chance to hear you play.

237
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,166
What?

238
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,458
You said he must start playing again.

239
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:39,416
I… sometimes listen to
your music while I'm working.

240
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,125
Really… it's very deep.

241
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,166
Thank you.

242
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:49,333
Your ability… gift to capture emotion is,

243
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,625
you know, the heart
and soul of a song, right?

244
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,291
Well, there's a table back
there that needs me, um…

245
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,083
I'll see you tomorrow.

246
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,958
And… Louw.

247
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,583
A pleasure meeting you.

248
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:06,916
Likewise.

249
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,583
Sometimes I help out at the shop.

250
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,458
Matewis said so, yes.

251
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,750
-Louw, I'm sorry…
-Marie, please it's…

252
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,916
Louw! Marie!

253
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,250
Here you are.

254
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,791
I'm not following you, I promise.

255
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,583
So when are visiting my class? Huh?

256
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,041
I… I don't think…

257
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:42,041
The children were excited when they heard
the famous Louw van Lier is in town.

258
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,791
I played them some of your songs.

259
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,416
Well, actually, some of them
have already been performed.

260
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
I'm sorry. You should know me by now.
I get so carried away.

261
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,833
So how does it feel being back in town?

262
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,708
-Yes, I…
-It must be quite boring?

263
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,708
-He's helping Matewis on the farm.
-Oh, really?

264
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,125
Um… Do you know a…

265
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,375
a child, Wim?

266
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,375
-Wim's son?
-Oh, Venter?

267
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,166
Wim Cloete's son. Yes.

268
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,916
He's in our school.

269
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,500
I mean, he attended
my class once or twice, but…

270
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,500
He just sat there.
I think he was too shy to participate.

271
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,958
Anyways…

272
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,500
Uh, Sandra! I'm late again.

273
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:25,791
Okay, Louw, it was so good to see you.
Come and visit! Please!

274
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,666
Okay, guys. Bye.

275
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:35,958
Wow! She has lots of energy.
She could give some to Eskom.

276
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,625
Um, hey, when…

277
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,333
When last did you see Mom?

278
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,500
I go every week.

279
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,791
I don't think she recognises me anymore.

280
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,791
If you catch her on a good day…

281
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:57,083
She often asks about Dad.

282
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,333
I just say he's somewhere on the farm.

283
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,458
It seems like it makes her happy.

284
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,500
I'll see you back at the farm?
Yes, fine.

285
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,291
Bye.

286
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
It's a farm!

287
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,666
There are always good times and bad times.

288
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,666
I need your help.

289
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,875
I've always paid!

290
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,791
How long have I been one of your clients?

291
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,666
P… P… Piggy!

292
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,458
Nice!

293
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,875
Please listen to me, Mrs. Malan.

294
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,916
The world has become green.

295
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,416
Yes.

296
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,083
My dad has pushed the
workers hard the last few years.

297
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,291
He sounds as if he can be quite strict.

298
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,041
D… D…

299
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,458
D… Do…

300
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:50,875
Do you know…

301
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,500
M… M…

302
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,750
Miss… Naude?

303
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,541
We were friends in high school.

304
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,208
A… A… Are…

305
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:07,458
Are you going to help in her class?

306
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,416
No.

307
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,583
I don't think so.

308
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,125
H… Her…

309
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,583
Her class…

310
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:31,416
performed your version of
"I Miss You" last year.

311
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:38,333
It seems like she really likes that one.

312
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,041
That was unbelievable.

313
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,208
I just needed to tell you that.

314
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,125
Uh.… I um…

315
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:57,958
I love the way you interpret the songs.

316
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,375
I've never heard "I Miss You"
sound like that.

317
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,000
With so much passion.

318
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,958
The whole audience was enchanted.

319
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,541
-Thank you.
-Karien.

320
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,375
Louw.

321
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,791
I think I have a card here somewhere.

322
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,375
I know most of the club owners.

323
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,666
Give me a call.
I'll arrange something for you.

324
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,083
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

325
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,666
Karien… Yes.

326
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,250
I…

327
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,791
often listen to your…

328
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:44,958
music.

329
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,541
I'm sorry to hear that.

330
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,750
So you like heartbreak songs?

331
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,666
I…

332
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,916
I… I like…

333
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,666
to know that I…

334
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:08,541
to know that I'm not alone.

335
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,250
That…

336
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:14,916
That there are other people who…

337
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,416
I always thought…

338
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,041
feeling that way would
make me more creative.

339
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:23,833
But there comes a point where…

340
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,916
where things get too
bad to write about them.

341
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,958
I understand.

342
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:39,166
Uh, uh, that's m… m… m… my dad.

343
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,208
-I… I have to go…
-It's okay. It's okay.

344
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,750
If you ever need anything,
come and look for me at the farm.

345
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,166
T… Thank you.

346
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,458
Where have you been? Huh?

347
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,416
I told you to wait in the car. Huh?

348
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,125
Get in.

349
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,041
I know you don't think
I'm good enough for you.

350
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,250
But I don't know what more I can do!

351
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,291
I did not want to be a farmer.

352
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,625
I did it for your father… for you!

353
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,625
I… Your whole family!

354
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,458
But everything I do,
it's not good enough for you.

355
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,458
What do you expect when
I find out from the bank

356
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,125
that we might lose our home?

357
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,750
I can't live with so much
uncertainty every day…

358
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,416
What do you want from me?

359
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,666
Don't always run away
to the farm every time

360
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,416
when things get tough or dark or unhappy.

361
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,375
I can't talk to you about this.

362
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,458
-I want to talk to you.
-Leave me alone!

363
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:01,041
Louw, I didn't realise
you'd be back already.

364
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,708
I only do it when I need to relax.

365
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,208
And don't be worried,
it's only farm issues.

366
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,958
Nothing for you to stress about.

367
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,666
You left this place
behind a long time ago.

368
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,958
Aren't you going to say something?

369
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,583
You're just like Matewis.

370
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,708
Why do you do this?

371
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:37,541
Even when we were kids,
you'd lock yourself in the room

372
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,500
and I had to get along on my own!

373
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:43,291
And when you came out you'd
make as if nothing was wrong!

374
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,666
I don't know how Karien survived with you!

375
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,125
And you two?

376
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,458
It seems the only thing that
can keep this farm alive is anger!

377
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,916
<i>The dancer was gone</i>

378
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,500
<i>By midnight the moon was sad and beautiful</i>

379
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:35,125
<i>And when the new morning</i>
<i>Arose from the mountain</i>

380
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,875
<i>Grey birds were watching us</i>

381
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:46,291
<i>Forty days and forty nights</i>

382
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,291
<i>We're looking for the mystical farmer</i>

383
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:55,083
<i>Like the black horses of midnight thoughts</i>

384
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,916
<i>He keeps on his guard and watches</i>

385
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:02,500
<i>Over his shoulder with a strange grin</i>

386
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,458
<i>And danced in the night</i>

387
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,625
<i>With the moon over his shoulder</i>

388
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:09,750
<i>With an eye which bravely came closer</i>

389
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:12,541
<i>To ask me my name</i>

390
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,500
P… P… P… Piggy.

391
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,541
P… P… P… Piggy!

392
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,708
Wow, Piggy,
but you've got some pair of tits.

393
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:43,250
They're almost bigger than Miss Naude's.

394
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,666
P… P… Piggy.

395
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,500
Should I get you one of
my sisters br….br…. bras?

396
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,083
P… P… Piggy. I'm talking to you.

397
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,958
P… P… Piggy.

398
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,416
Leave me!

399
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,458
-Leave me…
-Geez!

400
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:00,333
Piggy got himself
a nice pair of balls this holiday.

401
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,291
Hey, hey!

402
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,916
Hey, what's going on?

403
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,083
Hey!

404
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,083
Venter, Venter!

405
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,125
Stop.

406
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,458
Boys.

407
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:11,708
Out.

408
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,500
Hey! I'm warning you!

409
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,250
Venter?

410
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,000
S… Sorry, Sir…

411
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,500
Pl… Please don't phone my parents.

412
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,208
-P… P… Please…
-Okay, okay, okay.

413
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,208
Who can I call then?

414
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,458
Do you want to talk about it?

415
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:43,958
Uh… no.

416
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,708
S… S… Sorry that I bothered you.

417
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,791
Not at all.

418
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,916
I'm glad you did.

419
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:58,791
Did you take music lessons
when you were at school?

420
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,500
-Louw…
-No…

421
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,875
So kind of you to come and visit me.

422
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,791
Well… us.

423
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,791
Hello Venter, it's good to see you again.

424
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,166
Hello, Miss Naude.

425
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,833
Okay, so I told my children
you were going to pop in.

426
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,750
They're so excited to see you.

427
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes, bu… uh…

428
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:26,166
<i>Look if you can bring me the sun</i>

429
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:35,708
<i>There's a song that the sun can sing</i>

430
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:43,041
<i>It's quiet in the corner</i>
<i>In the cold season</i>

431
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:51,250
<i>Can you see what the wind</i>
<i>And the rain does to me</i>

432
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,458
<i>I'm asking you nicely</i>

433
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:09,500
<i>Let it shine for me again</i>

434
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,125
Well done, guys. Okay.

435
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,583
Continue so long with what
we started working on yesterday

436
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:18,958
and next time we can ask
Louw a few questions. Okay?

437
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,208
Quiet.

438
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,291
Hey, are you okay?

439
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:31,916
I can't do this.

440
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,125
Don't stress, they don't bite.

441
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,041
I told you I can't do this!

442
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,041
We need to go.

443
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,208
Louw?

444
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,000
Louw.

445
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,708
Can't you see I'm not ready for this?

446
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,916
Sorry, when I saw you I thought you…

447
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,250
What? Hmm?

448
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,041
What did you think? I was here to see you?

449
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,791
-No, I…
-Don't!

450
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,416
You were always like this.

451
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,416
Leave me alone.

452
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,041
I told you not this one!

453
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,041
Mrs. Malan, let's find the right one.

454
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,083
Philip, tell her to get away from me.

455
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,958
Let's go and sit, Mrs. Malan. Come.

456
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,291
We're just going to sit for a bit.

457
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,041
There you go.

458
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,500
Can you give me the beige jersey, please?

459
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,791
-There you go.
-Thank you.

460
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,250
She never listens to me.

461
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:56,791
I've told her, this one is my favourite.

462
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:06,833
Hey.

463
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,041
Hey, Mom.

464
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,375
Hey, Mommy, it's me.

465
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,833
I'm here.

466
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,833
I love looking at this
photo of the two of you.

467
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,750
You look so happy.

468
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,791
Did you bring her with you?

469
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,083
I would love to meet her.

470
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,166
Your dad as well.

471
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,791
Mom, she um…

472
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,500
She really wanted to be here, Mom.

473
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,750
Marie got those CDs for your dad.

474
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:49,708
What CDs?

475
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,375
I couldn't believe it myself.

476
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:55,916
I always tell them how famous my son is

477
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,250
but I don't think they believe me.

478
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,250
But I always knew.

479
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:05,083
You have this inner strength within you.

480
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:10,291
You always made me so proud.

481
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,958
Mrs. Malan, it's time for your medication.

482
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,125
Thank you very much.

483
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,833
Thank you very much, my dear.

484
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,458
Don't you want to play something for me?

485
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:20,458
It's nice to just feel
normal again for a change.

486
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,250
All I get these days
are pitiful looks. As if…

487
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,750
I'm suffering from some terminal illness.

488
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,791
Except Matewis.

489
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,583
I guess he just doesn't know any better.

490
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,041
Karien is dead.

491
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,875
And… I cannot change it.

492
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,541
Nobody can.

493
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,583
And…

494
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,541
I know you blame me for leaving.

495
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,250
And that's okay.

496
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,250
I know you didn't have a choice.

497
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,625
You also had dreams.

498
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,125
Mom needs me here.

499
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:13,750
I think she would've been in a
much worse condition if I also left.

500
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,208
I went to see her.

501
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:22,041
I tried not to tell you.

502
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,875
She thought I was Dad.

503
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,666
-What?
-I'm sorry.

504
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,500
-I'm sorry.
-What?

505
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,458
I told you, you look alike.

506
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,791
What did she say?

507
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,041
Something about CD's,

508
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,708
that you supposedly bought.

509
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,458
Oh.

510
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,833
Wait here.

511
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,291
Dad asked me to get these
when I came to see you in Pretoria.

512
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:30,416
He also didn't have a CD player,
so I had to get him that too.

513
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,041
I don't think he ever listened to it.

514
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,375
But just to have it…

515
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,291
meant so much to him.

516
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,250
He wasn't very impressed
that you used Mom's surname.

517
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,833
But I think he understood.

518
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,166
I remember when you came to get them.

519
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,500
I even drew a heart because
I thought it was for you.

520
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,250
If I knew it was for…

521
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,333
What?

522
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,541
That it was for Dad?

523
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,041
You probably wouldn't have given it to me.

524
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,625
No…

525
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,208
probably not.

526
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:23,291
Marie.

527
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:29,625
Thank you that you were always
the one who tried to keep us together.

528
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,583
I thought you'd still be at school?

529
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:12,375
I bunked one of my c… c… classes.

530
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:16,833
Were you just playing now?

531
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,291
No.

532
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,208
I…

533
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,500
I'm just thinking.

534
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:28,875
I um…

535
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:32,166
I know people don't
listen to CDs anymore but…

536
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:42,375
Miss Naude said you
attended her class a few times?

537
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:50,250
My dad did not want me to do music.

538
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:55,708
He never even attended one of my shows.

539
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,458
And I always thought it was
because he was ashamed of me.

540
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,958
And I used it… to drive me.

541
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,083
To prove him wrong.

542
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:14,500
C… C… Can you play something for me?

543
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,541
I tell you what,
I'll play you something if…

544
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,625
If you sing with me.

545
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,291
No, no.

546
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,125
I understand you're afraid, Venter.

547
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,000
I am also afraid. Always.

548
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,791
My throat becomes dry and…

549
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,916
my heart beats so fast, it
feels like it's going to jump out.

550
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:39,625
But I've learnt that it's
perhaps a good thing.

551
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:43,208
It means I'm at the point of…

552
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,458
doing something important.

553
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,333
Do what makes you happy, Venter.

554
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,416
Not what other people want you to do.

555
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,166
<i>I'm longing for you</i>

556
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,083
<i>For the wind that wraps its arms around me</i>

557
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:21,041
<i>That's how I'm longing</i>
<i>As the sun and the moon and the wind</i>

558
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:24,166
<i>And the clouds pass me by</i>

559
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,166
<i>Are you longing for me too?</i>

560
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:35,916
<i>In the distant land where you live now</i>

561
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,166
<i>And are you longing</i>
<i>As the sun and the moon and the wind</i>

562
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,625
<i>And the clouds pass you by</i>

563
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,583
<i>I'm longing for you</i>

564
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:55,083
<i>I long because I really like you</i>

565
00:48:56,083 --> 00:49:01,041
<i>I am longing as the sun</i>
<i>And the moon and the wind</i>

566
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:04,958
<i>And the clouds pass you by</i>

567
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:12,041
<i>Blow wind</i>

568
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:16,000
<i>Bring him back to me</i>

569
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:22,708
<i>-Blow wind</i>
<i>-And the clouds pass me by</i>

570
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,583
<i>Bring him back to me</i>

571
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,041
<i>I'm longing for you</i>

572
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:34,625
<i>For the wind that wraps its arms around…</i>

573
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,250
Are you okay?

574
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,541
Venter, I know how difficult it is
to love somebody who hurts you.

575
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:50,166
It feels as if you shouldn't love them.

576
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:54,458
And sometimes we mustn't.

577
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,750
Come in… Hey, come in.

578
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,500
-Hi. Do you have a moment?
-Yes.

579
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,041
I'm just marking.

580
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,416
And I'm done!

581
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,875
Don't worry, it's just a short exercise.

582
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,583
It doesn't count towards their final mark.

583
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,708
I…

584
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,458
I came to apologise for the other day.

585
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,833
-Louw, it's…
-I know you're trying to be friendly.

586
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:36,041
So I'm…

587
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,958
I'm sorry.

588
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:43,166
I know I can sometimes
come across a bit too strong.

589
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,125
I think that's why you broke up with me
in the first place.

590
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,250
N… No. It…

591
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,458
It wasn't that, I…

592
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,958
I don't know. At that stage…

593
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,750
I thought I wasn't good enough.

594
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,208
I needed to find my own feet, you know.

595
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,458
And it…

596
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:10,458
didn't feel fair to drag somebody
with me into the unknown.

597
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:16,583
-And look where I ended up!
-Hmm.

598
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,500
I see you're still fascinated by France.

599
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,041
And Asia.

600
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:31,750
Did you ever go?

601
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:35,125
No, no. Those are just gifts.

602
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,666
I'm lucky if I get the chance
to leave the province.

603
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,625
-I was there a few years ago.
-Paris?

604
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:46,250
-To perform?
-No. No. I…

605
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,041
Karien and I went.

606
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:54,375
France, Germany, Holland.

607
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,500
Wow.

608
00:51:58,291 --> 00:51:59,458
I think you'd love it.

609
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:10,166
Was it easy for you
to leave here at the time?

610
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:15,791
No, it's never easy to
leave everything behind.

611
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:20,333
Family, friends and you
know how my father was.

612
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,791
I don't know, I…

613
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,291
My dreams weren't here.

614
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,958
I had this…

615
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,333
unbelievable desire to…

616
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,000
I don't know?

617
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:41,291
I think I would have gone crazy if
I had to stay here a moment longer.

618
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yes.

619
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:50,333
A few years ago I bought a backpack.

620
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,958
Way too big for me.

621
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:58,083
A place for everything, secret pockets.
You know, the whole nine yards.

622
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:02,041
I had to make sure that there was
enough space in case I needed it.

623
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,875
And then I put it next to my front door

624
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:08,375
so it would always remind me that

625
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,583
one day I would see the world.

626
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:14,291
The children kept asking me:
"Ma'am, when are you going on your trip?"

627
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,583
And I always had an excuse.

628
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,625
I had to organise a school function or

629
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,458
there was a sick family member.

630
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:30,625
I eventually became so tired of it,
I hid it in the back of my cupboard.

631
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:45,416
Well, if your offer still stands…

632
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,083
I'd like to help in the class.

633
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:52,333
But let's first give it a
try and see how it goes.

634
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:53,416
Of course.

635
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,375
The children are crazy about you.

636
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,708
They keep asking me
when you're coming back.

637
00:53:58,791 --> 00:54:01,041
I want, I want to see if
Venter doesn't maybe…

638
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,833
We can go and see if you want to.

639
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,166
Oh, wow!

640
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,750
And that unbelievable music.

641
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,750
Have they done productions of them?

642
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,458
Haven't gone that big yet.

643
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,666
-Hi, Venter.
-Did you play well?

644
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,375
Yes.

645
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:26,250
I take it he wasn't very happy
with some of the decisions.

646
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,708
No.

647
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:29,166
So, Louw's coming to help
us with the music class--

648
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,958
Come, Venter, we're leaving.

649
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:32,250
Yes, Dad.

650
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:35,958
-See you on the farm.
-Bye.

651
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:38,958
Hi, I'm Louw.

652
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:40,833
That's right. The singer?

653
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,333
My wife says you were
quite famous, in your day.

654
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,333
Louw's going to help
out in the music class.

655
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:48,791
Maybe Venter can join us?

656
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,625
How do you know my son?

657
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,166
Oh, from the farm.

658
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,750
We chatted a bit while you were
talking to my brother-in-law.

659
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,333
Yes, well maybe you can talk some
sense into him to accept my offer.

660
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:03,541
Venter, we're leaving.

661
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:05,166
Yes Dad.

662
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,583
Not the most pleasant man, is he?

663
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:08,708
No.

664
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:16,333
I'm late!

665
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:22,541
Morning.

666
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:23,708
Hey.

667
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,333
What a handsome brother I have.

668
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,791
I thought I'd try to make a good
first impression in front of the children.

669
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,750
Well, um, second impression.

670
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,291
We can drive together if you'd like.

671
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,791
I'm working at the shop today

672
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,208
and I'm sure Sandra
won't mind dropping you off.

673
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:41,625
No, it's fine, thank you.

674
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,916
Oh, damn, I must go.

675
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,458
Not that Henk minds if I'm late but still.

676
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,000
-See you tonight.
-Yes.

677
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,125
-Bye.
-Bye.

678
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:51,958
Bye, Matewis.

679
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:55,541
Matewis.

680
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,291
Welcome to voicemail.

681
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:52,958
You have one new message.

682
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,875
Hi Marie.

683
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:57,791
I'm just making sure
you're still coming in today.

684
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,166
I'm waiting with bated breath.

685
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,750
I'll see you shortly.

686
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,916
To repeat this message, press one.

687
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,875
<i>Blow wind</i>

688
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,291
Nice.

689
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,791
<i>Bring him back to me</i>

690
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:21,375
<i>Blow wind</i>

691
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,208
<i>Bring him back to me</i>

692
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,375
That was…

693
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:38,750
beautiful.

694
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,791
I couldn't have done it better myself.

695
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,041
Fantastic.

696
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:45,500
You see, coming from a real musician.

697
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,125
Okay. Let's show him what
we've practised for the festival.

698
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:53,666
-Be good. See you.
-Bye.

699
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:56,250
There you go. Bye.

700
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:01,166
Bye.

701
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,916
You've always had such beautiful hands.

702
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,791
So, um…

703
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,375
What are you still
planning for the festival?

704
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,208
Oh, still a few songs.

705
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,625
We must open with the National Anthem.

706
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,125
After that,
I thought we could do "Sun Catcher".

707
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:19,291
And then we must decide which
other songs we are going to do.

708
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:23,416
I was wondering if Venter
doesn't want to sing something.

709
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,833
If it's okay with you?

710
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:26,083
Yes, of course.

711
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,458
Yes, I think he, he needs it.

712
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,041
You know, if my dad…

713
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:31,833
Excuse me.

714
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,916
Venter, can I have a quick word with you?

715
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,125
Hey, P…P…P…Piggy!

716
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:44,500
Venter, at the festival,

717
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:49,958
I thought it would be a great
opportunity for you to show your talent.

718
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:52,500
Miss Naude said you can take part.

719
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:57,416
My d… dad said I'm not
supposed to speak to you.

720
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,750
Venter, your voice, it's…

721
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:03,250
It's really something special.

722
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:05,875
I, I…

723
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:08,125
I must g… go.

724
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:09,708
Leave me alone.

725
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:11,458
You have a talent, Venter.

726
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,583
And it would be a shame
if you allow your dad to…

727
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:17,875
And what about you? Huh?

728
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,416
You say I mustn't waste my talent.

729
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,875
But what about yours?

730
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,208
My dad says you only came back

731
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,291
because you made an
ass of yourself in Pretoria.

732
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,791
-I'm sorry.
-Your dad is right.

733
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,625
I did make an idiot of myself.

734
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,791
But it's no excuse for what he's doing.

735
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:46,250
You deserve better, Venter.

736
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,916
You must believe it.

737
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:50,041
I…

738
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:52,125
I must go.

739
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,541
Venter.

740
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,791
Sorry, where did you say Matewis is?

741
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,875
A meeting with our accountant.

742
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,333
He didn't tell me why.

743
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:44,250
So, how's it going at the school?

744
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,208
I'm sure the children love it.

745
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:51,541
And Sandra probably
hasn't felt this good in a while.

746
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:54,750
It went well.

747
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:56,458
Stressful, but good.

748
01:01:58,083 --> 01:01:59,500
I…

749
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,791
spoke to Venter, but he…

750
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:05,041
Well his, his dad is…

751
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:16,458
Remember the time when you
entered the school's talent festival?

752
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:21,791
You knew you'd win but you only
wanted to see how upset Dad would be.

753
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:23,666
Yes.

754
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:29,666
It's not easy for everybody
to leave the known behind.

755
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,166
Especially not the people around here.

756
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,250
But you're different.

757
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:39,041
You'll never be someone who fits in a box.

758
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:45,291
And

759
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:48,083
as much as I enjoy having you here.

760
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,625
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

761
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,625
I saw your lyrics.

762
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:04,750
Not on purpose. It fell.

763
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,791
You wrote her a song.

764
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,791
I was busy writing it but I…

765
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:17,250
I couldn't finish it.

766
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,833
I…

767
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:22,625
I never knew why.

768
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,583
But…

769
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:25,958
today when…

770
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:29,041
when I saw the children sing.

771
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,583
The innocent joy on their faces.

772
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:34,958
There was no guard.

773
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,375
They didn't pretend to be something else.

774
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:41,791
Then I realised…

775
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:47,791
what a liar I am.

776
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:52,625
I loved Karien.

777
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,208
She made me feel it was…

778
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,791
worthwhile leaving everything behind,
my friends and my family.

779
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,166
But there was always something.

780
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:11,500
Something that stopped
me from telling her.

781
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:15,666
As if it would make me weak…

782
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:19,541
or give her too much power over me.

783
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:25,625
And I slowly began pushing her away.

784
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:29,166
I focused all my

785
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,166
energy on my music and…

786
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,916
to prove Dad wrong.

787
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,541
I never told her how much I loved her.

788
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,208
She never got the
opportunity to give this to me.

789
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:13,791
She got so tired of waiting for me that…

790
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,666
that she wanted to do it herself.

791
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,333
Louw…

792
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,833
You must stop blaming yourself.

793
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:31,708
She knew that you loved her.

794
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,833
Not the way I wanted her to know.

795
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,750
And do you know how it feels to…

796
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:45,583
always think that people must
lower their expectations to be with you.

797
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:50,291
Every day of my life.

798
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:01,375
Matewis always wanted a big family.

799
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,500
Me too.

800
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,750
But when we found out that
I couldn't have children…

801
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,666
I could see how disappointed he was.

802
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:14,958
He said he feels sorry for me but…

803
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,458
I know he wishes I was somebody else.

804
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:28,625
I think he even blames me
for the farm's barren land.

805
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,125
The drought.

806
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,375
As if I contaminated the entire farm.

807
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,541
I am so sorry, Marie.

808
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,541
I can see it on his face.

809
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,083
How he thinks…

810
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:47,166
about what his life could have been.

811
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:51,750
It's easy to think about…

812
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:56,250
what could have happened if
you made other choices in your life.

813
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,583
I see what you're like
when you're with Henk.

814
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:10,791
No, no it's beautiful. You…

815
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,333
You even look different.

816
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,625
Like the sister I knew.

817
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Happy.

818
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,416
Do you think um…

819
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,625
Do you think Matewis suspects anything?

820
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,666
I don't think so.

821
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:32,375
Henk said…

822
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,875
It's probably nothing.

823
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:39,791
But I forgot my phone here
today and Henk left a message

824
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:41,583
and I didn't get it.

825
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,666
-But you don't think he, he would…
-No.

826
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:50,541
No, in any case, Henk
only asked where I was and,

827
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,791
and there's nothing to tell, it's…

828
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:56,625
We didn't do anything. It's just innocent.

829
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:01,708
It's just nice to feel like…

830
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,041
somebody is treating
me like something new.

831
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:13,166
I think Matewis thinks I am
a broken piece of equipment.

832
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:20,208
Probably means I belong with the
rest of the broken things on this farm.

833
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,625
Can we have a word, please?

834
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:37,708
I better go and check if he is okay.

835
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:39,583
It's okay.

836
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:25,166
I haven't h… heard this s… song before.

837
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,541
I'm still trying to finish it.

838
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:29,250
It's still very rough.

839
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,791
I didn't think I'd see you again.

840
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:41,083
I… wanted to c… come
and a… apologise, Sir.

841
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:43,125
You've got nothing to apologise for.

842
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:45,750
You sounded like the voice in my head.

843
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:48,916
And it's good that you spoke for yourself.

844
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:02,750
I… I don't care.

845
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,250
I was wrong.

846
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:11,750
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

847
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,333
<i>One that you deserved</i>

848
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,000
<i>Now I'm standing in shame</i>

849
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:21,291
<i>This is my burden</i>

850
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:32,500
Do you want to sing it with me?

851
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,958
I… can't.

852
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,625
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

853
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:43,000
<i>One that you deserved</i>

854
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:46,125
<i>So I'm standing in shame</i>

855
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,500
<i>This is my burden</i>

856
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,208
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

857
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,333
<i>One that you deserved</i>

858
01:10:57,416 --> 01:11:02,458
<i>I keep stumbling again and again</i>

859
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:07,375
<i>With prayers at night</i>

860
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:12,958
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

861
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:16,125
<i>One that you deserved</i>

862
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,708
<i>So I'm standing in shame</i>

863
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:22,250
<i>This is my burden</i>

864
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:25,708
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

865
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:28,791
<i>Like you deserved</i>

866
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:33,583
<i>I'm stumbling again and again.</i>

867
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,666
There you go. Here.

868
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,208
-If you want to practise.
-Thank you.

869
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,416
Don't worry, I'll explain.

870
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:49,666
It's okay.

871
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:54,125
-Venter, get in the car.
-Wim, relax, please.

872
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:57,416
This is what you enjoy.
To be alone with young boys.

873
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,833
Dad!

874
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,666
You're such a wuss.
No wonder you admire him.

875
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,541
Wim please, we were just writing music.

876
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:05,958
Is this what you want?

877
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:08,166
To come from a family
that everybody laughs at.

878
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,375
-On a farm where nothing grows?
-Yes.

879
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,666
My family is not perfect.

880
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,833
And we don't pretend to be.

881
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:17,125
That's all I've seen since I've been here.

882
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:19,458
People who run away from the truth.

883
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:22,333
You should've heard how
your father spoke about you.

884
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:23,833
How ashamed he was of you.

885
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:25,000
And me of him.

886
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:27,083
I didn't even want his name.

887
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:29,666
Well fortunately for him
he had two children like you.

888
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,708
Because between you
and your infertile sister

889
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:33,416
there'll be nothing left of his name.

890
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:35,666
No!

891
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,458
-Louw!
-Don't touch him!

892
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,541
Venter!

893
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,125
No. No!

894
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:56,916
Venter, get in the car!

895
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:52,916
I'm sorry I wasn't here when…

896
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:02,583
I… don't think you wanted
me here in any way.

897
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,500
It probably worked
out best for both of us.

898
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:13,916
You've always been with me.

899
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,041
In the back of my mind.

900
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:21,750
Busy telling me that
I'm not going to make it.

901
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,916
The… anger that it provoked in me.

902
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:31,333
I used it…

903
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,458
to drive myself.

904
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:39,166
So that I could come back one day
and show you what I have achieved.

905
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,333
And now…

906
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,333
Now I am exactly what you said I'd be.

907
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:55,916
A failure.

908
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:01,666
Not worthy of the Malan name.

909
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:04,791
My mother's son.

910
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:07,625
Not yours.

911
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:12,458
Marie is struggling, Dad.

912
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:15,416
She hides it well but I can see it.

913
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:21,875
I always thought she was the strong one.

914
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:25,791
Like you.

915
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:30,666
She was the only one who
could stand up to you.

916
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,791
She showed me the CDs she got for you.

917
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,333
Hell, Dad, why couldn't you
just once say something positive?

918
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:46,250
Just once.

919
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:52,458
Mom did it so many, so many times
that it started feeling normal.

920
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:56,416
But if something like that
could've come from you.

921
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:00,625
Do you know what it would've meant to me?

922
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:07,166
I wish you could have met Karien.

923
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,208
Maybe then…

924
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,541
you would've understood what I was doing.

925
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:20,333
That I made the right choice back then.

926
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,375
She always said what she was thinking.

927
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,208
Not like us.

928
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:31,916
Maybe then I would've

929
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,375
been able to tell you everything
while you could still hear me.

930
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,708
Before you became just
another voice in the wind.

931
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,166
But I think it's time I realise that…

932
01:18:46,416 --> 01:18:49,583
me being here is not good for anybody.

933
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,083
It only serves as a…

934
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:55,416
memory that you cannot
run away from yourself,

935
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,416
no matter how hard you try.

936
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:01,416
But um…

937
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:04,750
There's this boy.

938
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:08,708
He reminds me a lot of myself.

939
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:13,250
I want to tell him to run.

940
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,958
To run and never turn back.

941
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:21,833
What example am I for him?

942
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:24,375
And his dad is…

943
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:30,958
Let's just say, it makes me
think you were never that bad.

944
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:39,083
Things could've been worse.

945
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:11,458
Marie.

946
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:14,208
Hey.

947
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:16,083
It's Matewis.

948
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,333
Hey.

949
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,166
It's okay.

950
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:22,291
What happened?

951
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:24,875
You're bleeding…

952
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,750
Let it go. It doesn't matter.
What happened?

953
01:20:27,916 --> 01:20:29,583
It's all my fault.

954
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,375
Hey.

955
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,625
Hey.

956
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,250
Hey.

957
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,125
I'm going to tell Matewis about Henk.

958
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:02,291
I'm sure he already knows but…

959
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,625
I just feel everything must just come out.

960
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:10,500
I don't want any more secrets.

961
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,125
It was just nice to…

962
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:25,416
to feel loved again.

963
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,666
That's something one
should never turn away.

964
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:42,291
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

965
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,250
I can't believe he hit you.

966
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,750
-And now, this thing with Matewis.
-Yes.

967
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:59,958
Marie is going to visit
him again tomorrow.

968
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,666
See if he can come home.

969
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,166
Is there anything else I can get you?

970
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:13,208
Tell me about your trip.

971
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,416
Where did you want to go to?

972
01:22:20,291 --> 01:22:26,083
Well, a few years ago I
saw a photo of a temple.

973
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,041
The Tiger's Nest in Bhutan.

974
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,166
It's built on the edge of a mountain.

975
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:34,875
Almost as if it was there first and

976
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:37,125
the mountain appeared around it later.

977
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:40,958
Come sit here.

978
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,875
Anyway, um…

979
01:22:58,541 --> 01:22:59,666
so…

980
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:02,750
I remember just staring at the photo and

981
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:06,375
I wondered how it must feel
to stand in such a holy place

982
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,666
and peek over the edge.

983
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:12,416
You know, just to feel the
foundation that you are standing on

984
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:15,208
which has been there for centuries and

985
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,500
it could slip away at any time.

986
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:36,375
I suspected something.

987
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:42,791
When I heard his voice message…

988
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,125
it clarified everything.

989
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:55,041
I wanted to confront him.

990
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:00,666
I even thought of…

991
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:10,291
But then I remembered your face.

992
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:14,958
Joyful. Happy.

993
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:19,500
Something you're not when you're with me.

994
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,458
I've never really felt
that I make you happy.

995
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:30,625
And I think your dad
also didn't think I could.

996
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:34,625
That's how I always feel around you.

997
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:38,250
As if you blame me because I can't…

998
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:41,208
You're everything in my life.

999
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,125
And just the idea of losing you.

1000
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:56,458
Can I come in?

1001
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:04,791
-Hi.
-Hi.

1002
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:11,208
How did you handle it…

1003
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:14,416
when you lost Karien?

1004
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:32,083
First, I decided that my
life had ended right there.

1005
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:36,750
That I also died.

1006
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:42,416
I didn't go to Heaven or,
or Hell, I was just there.

1007
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:46,291
As if something from outside
was controlling my body.

1008
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:49,833
And…

1009
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:54,833
it took me a long time…

1010
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:57,250
to…

1011
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:01,916
remember what it felt like to be happy.

1012
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,250
And…

1013
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:08,916
when I sit amongst all
the rubble on the farm…

1014
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,708
and I look at all the broken and

1015
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:16,166
rusted things that
people have thrown away.

1016
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:21,541
Then I realised that everything,
once upon a time, was loved.

1017
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,666
Or at least useful.

1018
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:30,166
And I could see myself there.

1019
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:33,208
And it made me think…

1020
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:36,333
why I'm still here.

1021
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:38,666
If I can't make people laugh or…

1022
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:40,958
cry or

1023
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:42,666
even feel?

1024
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,541
Matewis…

1025
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,000
there is only the present.

1026
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,875
There's only the pain and…

1027
01:26:56,208 --> 01:26:59,750
the joy and the sorrow of the
past that must be left behind.

1028
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:04,750
What we do now means something.

1029
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:09,416
This is how we change our world.

1030
01:27:11,416 --> 01:27:13,250
I want to make your sister happy.

1031
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:19,750
I know I'm the reason you are so unhappy.

1032
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,958
I think it's time to sell the farm.

1033
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,125
It's not making any of us happy.

1034
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:41,083
It's the best thing to do.

1035
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:10,625
<i>Long afloat on shipless oceans</i>

1036
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:17,458
<i>Gave everything just to smile</i>

1037
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:24,541
<i>Until your seeing eyes and fingers</i>

1038
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:31,333
<i>Drew me to your island</i>

1039
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:32,458
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1040
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:36,000
<i>And you sang</i>

1041
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,291
It's perfect.

1042
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:39,416
<i>Sail to me</i>

1043
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:46,750
<i>Sail to me, let my arms enfold you</i>

1044
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:50,000
<i>Here I am</i>

1045
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,708
<i>Here I am</i>

1046
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:59,250
<i>I'm waiting to hold you</i>

1047
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:08,708
<i>I'm so confused like the newly born child</i>

1048
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:15,583
<i>So plagued like the tide</i>

1049
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:22,958
<i>Must I stand in the middle of the waves</i>

1050
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:29,708
<i>Or will I go and lie next to the dead</i>
<i>My bride</i>

1051
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:35,958
<i>I'm waiting to hold you</i>

1052
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,750
<i>Sail to me</i>

1053
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:48,791
<i>Sail to me</i>

1054
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:54,833
<i>I'm waiting to hold you</i>

1055
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,458
Look, I think we'll take
Witteberg this year.

1056
01:30:36,541 --> 01:30:38,041
-Absolutely.
-For sure.

1057
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,166
Good afternoon gents.

1058
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,000
-Good afternoon.
-How are you doing?

1059
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:43,791
-Good.
-Ah, that's good.

1060
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,541
We have a good team this year.

1061
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:47,333
Yes, yes, yes.

1062
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:49,000
Pity that Venter couldn't play.

1063
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:50,041
Yes.

1064
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:51,541
Freak accident, you say?

1065
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:54,833
Yes. The child has a
habit of hurting himself.

1066
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:02,916
Mr. Cloete.

1067
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,458
Venter is a good boy.

1068
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,875
He just needs the right
kind of encouragement.

1069
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:12,041
You'll see. He's stronger than he looks.

1070
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Well…

1071
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:16,833
I'll see you guys at the concert, right?

1072
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:18,166
-Yeah.
-Yes, yes.

1073
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,916
Listen can you tell me
why he is our coach.

1074
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,625
Because he looks much more eager

1075
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:25,958
to hear songs being
sung than to win the game.

1076
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:33,041
-How you feeling?
-Okay.

1077
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,125
I'm nervous.

1078
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:39,250
It's going to be wonderful.

1079
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:42,708
Have you seen Venter?

1080
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:43,833
No.

1081
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,500
Not since the whole…

1082
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:47,666
Yeah.

1083
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:49,833
I'm sure he is okay.

1084
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:05,416
<i>Just children of the wind</i>

1085
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:22,208
The next song is one that I wrote

1086
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,375
as a tribute to somebody very special.

1087
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:36,958
And I wish I could have
said it before it was too late.

1088
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:45,125
So I hope it helps somebody here
to not make the same mistake.

1089
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,083
The fucking man can't sing.

1090
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:17,625
His being is crushed.

1091
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:23,375
Watch him. He thinks he's big.

1092
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:33,166
Listen.

1093
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,500
Let's show them who's the better man.

1094
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,750
<i>This is my confession</i>

1095
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,833
<i>My soul laid bare</i>

1096
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:55,958
<i>A call to those who left me</i>

1097
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:59,083
<i>Before I could say my say</i>

1098
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:02,041
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

1099
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:04,750
<i>One that you deserved</i>

1100
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,708
<i>So I'm standing in shame</i>

1101
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:09,791
<i>This is my burden</i>

1102
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:13,333
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

1103
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:16,125
<i>Which you deserved</i>

1104
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:20,791
<i>I stumble again and again</i>

1105
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:26,541
<i>With prayers in the wind</i>

1106
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,083
<i>But my road is not finished yet</i>

1107
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:32,958
<i>My time is not yet over</i>

1108
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:35,666
<i>And before I go to the depths</i>

1109
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:38,583
<i>There are still thoughts in my head</i>

1110
01:34:38,666 --> 01:34:41,083
<i>That I would meet you again</i>

1111
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:43,875
<i>And my life has purpose</i>

1112
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,583
<i>I promise you, my love</i>

1113
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:49,375
<i>All of it that I still have</i>

1114
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:51,958
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

1115
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:55,166
<i>One that you deserved</i>

1116
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,458
<i>So I'm standing in shame</i>

1117
01:34:57,541 --> 01:35:00,166
<i>This is my burden</i>

1118
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:03,125
<i>I wish I was a better man</i>

1119
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:05,458
<i>Like you deserved</i>

1120
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:09,083
<i>I stumble again and again</i>

1121
01:35:10,291 --> 01:35:14,208
<i>Prayers in the wind</i>

1122
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:52,375
-That was wonderful.
-Thank you.

1123
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:55,208
-That song was wonderful.
-Thank you.

1124
01:35:57,541 --> 01:36:00,708
-Matewis.
-Congrats your show was unbelievable.

1125
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:03,041
I didn't think that you
could sing like that.

1126
01:36:10,291 --> 01:36:11,791
So.

1127
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:14,541
It looks like you two
were the heroes tonight.

1128
01:36:15,916 --> 01:36:16,958
W… w…w…w…

1129
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,041
Wh… w…

1130
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:30,083
When I stood on that stage
and saw you standing there alone,

1131
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:34,708
angry at the whole world,
while everybody was so happy.

1132
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:39,041
For the first time I realised
that I am better than you, Dad.

1133
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:42,625
And I am also better off than you, Dad.

1134
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:47,125
I just feel sorry for you, Dad.

1135
01:36:48,166 --> 01:36:51,333
That you lost so much in life.

1136
01:36:59,208 --> 01:37:00,791
Yes, drive safely.

1137
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:02,041
Go well.

1138
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:07,500
And, what did they say?

1139
01:37:07,583 --> 01:37:10,000
Well, they are not going
to bully me anymore.

1140
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,250
Hopefully.

1141
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:13,166
That's good.

1142
01:37:14,166 --> 01:37:15,208
So….

1143
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:19,541
-I see you have a new guitar.
-Yes…

1144
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,583
Not as nice as the other one.

1145
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:38,000
-I'm on my way. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

1146
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:39,333
Have a good evening.

1147
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:44,500
-What did he have to say?
-Oh, nothing.

1148
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:51,875
Thank you.

1149
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:53,583
For what?

1150
01:37:56,208 --> 01:37:58,250
That you…

1151
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:04,583
helped me find what I thought…

1152
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:06,958
was lost forever.

1153
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:10,666
Of course.

1154
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,083
Come.
