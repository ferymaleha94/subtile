01:34.529 --> 01:37.331
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:37.364 --> 01:41.134
Shh... Listen, everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

01:48.843 --> 01:53.146
<i>Some folks say,</i>
<i>life is an open book.</i>

01:53.180 --> 01:57.284
<i>You're born, you live, you die,</i>

01:57.317 --> 02:00.855
<i>and not much changes</i>
<i>in between.</i>

02:00.888 --> 02:04.257
<i>Me, I've had a front row seat</i>
<i>of human nature</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:08.529
<i>long enough to know</i>
<i>that sin corrupts.</i>

02:08.563 --> 02:12.567
<i>And that species of sin</i>
<i>known as greed</i>
<i>corrupts absolutely.</i>

02:14.267 --> 02:16.804
<i>Some people</i>
<i>just like rolling the dice.</i>

02:16.838 --> 02:20.508
<i>And if you get snake eyes,</i>
<i>well, you just deal with it.</i>

02:20.541 --> 02:23.176
<i>That's life in Mississippi</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

02:23.210 --> 02:25.880
<i>Even the Magnolia State.</i>

02:25.913 --> 02:28.616
<i>What goes down</i>
<i>in the heat of passion,</i>

02:28.650 --> 02:31.284
<i>or just plain stupidity,</i>

02:31.318 --> 02:33.554
<i>can haunt a body forever.</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:37.457
<i>No matter where you go.</i>

02:37.491 --> 02:41.629
<i>Some things just have a way</i>
<i>of sticking to your soul...</i>

02:41.663 --> 02:45.198
<i>and staining it for eternity.</i>

02:50.404 --> 02:52.707
<i>Hell is real, my friends.</i>

02:52.740 --> 02:55.375
<i>It was prepared</i>
<i>for the devil and his angels,</i>

02:55.409 --> 02:58.746
<i>but sinners who follow after</i>
<i>the devil's wicked ways</i>

02:58.780 --> 03:01.683
<i>will be thrown into</i>
<i>the unquenchable lake of fire.</i>

03:01.716 --> 03:04.986
<i>For sinners, they're not</i>
<i>covered in the blood of Jesus.</i>

03:05.019 --> 03:08.388
<i>Be aware, God is not...</i>

03:08.422 --> 03:11.859
<i>You can't go around drinkin',</i>
<i>gamblin', stealin'</i>

03:11.893 --> 03:16.731
<i>killin', whorin' around</i>
<i>and think God'll just</i>
<i>turn a blind eye to it all.</i>

03:16.764 --> 03:18.533
<i>Friend, you need to repent.</i>

03:18.566 --> 03:20.601
<i>You need to accept Jesus</i>

03:20.635 --> 03:22.937
<i>and let him pay the price</i>
<i>for your sins.</i>

03:24.772 --> 03:28.843
<i>What will you choose:</i>
<i>heaven or hell?</i>

03:28.876 --> 03:32.547
<i>Don't be fooled,</i>
<i>God is comin', death is comin'.</i>

03:32.580 --> 03:34.314
<i>It's coming for us all.</i>

03:34.347 --> 03:36.450
<i>It's right around the corner</i>
<i>for some of you.</i>

03:36.483 --> 03:38.920
<i>And where will you be</i>
<i>when it finds you?</i>

03:38.953 --> 03:42.355
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

04:22.462 --> 04:23.798
Thank you.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.831
- I ordered you pancakes.
- To go I hope.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.804
Oh...

05:04.806 --> 05:06.874
Is this true?

05:06.908 --> 05:08.676
You know, you need to
take it easy, Cecil.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.611
Tell me the paper got it wrong.

05:10.645 --> 05:12.880
Generally,
the <i>Gazette</i> is right.

05:12.914 --> 05:17.084
Well, I see that you gentlemen
have lots to talk about.

05:17.118 --> 05:19.020
I'll see you at the office.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.822
Excuse me.

05:20.855 --> 05:22.023
How?

05:22.056 --> 05:24.424
You said it was a done deal.
A sure thing.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.061
Okay, Cecil, sometimes
it doesn't go as planned,
all right.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.097
- I want my money back.
- Cecil, that's not possible.

05:30.131 --> 05:31.632
- Okay?
- I want it back!

05:36.737 --> 05:38.105
You know,
I didn't hear you complaining

05:38.139 --> 05:39.607
when I made you
a bundle of cash

05:39.640 --> 05:42.442
on that tech stock
a few months ago.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.946
No, but then you made
Roland sound so good,

05:44.979 --> 05:47.447
I put in all I had to buy it.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.550
That's your decision,
Cecil, not mine.

05:49.584 --> 05:51.586
So, that's it?

05:51.619 --> 05:53.420
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.156
Oh, there's nothing you can do?

05:55.189 --> 05:57.525
But there's something I can do.

05:58.491 --> 05:59.660
You just wait.

05:59.694 --> 06:01.996
What's deserving's
coming for you.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.131
- Coffee, Russ?
- Yes, please.

06:04.165 --> 06:06.534
- Mm.
- This ain't over.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.935
Not even close.

06:08.703 --> 06:10.004
Ma'am.

06:12.907 --> 06:15.743
- Thanks for saving me.
- Huh. Yeah.

06:16.878 --> 06:19.981
What's got his dander up?

06:20.014 --> 06:22.550
There were
a couple of companies
that were supposed to merge,

06:22.583 --> 06:25.086
and if they did the stock
would've skyrocketed and...

06:25.119 --> 06:27.655
- And they didn't?
- No, ma'am, they didn't.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.658
Hm. And you persuaded him
to buy some

06:30.691 --> 06:33.426
Unfortunately,
a lot of people, yeah.

06:34.729 --> 06:37.965
I wouldn't want to be you today.

06:37.999 --> 06:40.433
Well, why don't you
come over for supper tonight?

06:40.467 --> 06:42.003
I'm making beef stew
for me and Daddy,

06:42.036 --> 06:45.172
and I expect you
might want a little company.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.009
You would expect to be right.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.453
You know, I won't forget,
I never forget.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.189
And he will call you back.

07:02.223 --> 07:04.225
We both know you, it's fine.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.961
Yes. You can--
Oh, hold on.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.963
Phone won't stop ringing.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.732
Got more than a dozen
messages here so far.

07:11.766 --> 07:14.201
Well, I guess
I'm the town pariah, Pernie.

07:14.235 --> 07:16.037
Seems so.

07:17.138 --> 07:19.140
- You got a visitor.
- Hm?

07:19.173 --> 07:20.473
The sheriff.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.977
Oh, shit.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.918
What do I owe the pleasure?

07:33.721 --> 07:37.058
I told my brother to be
careful about investing.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.995
He wanted to build himself
a nest egg.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.865
Retire. He trusted you.

07:46.734 --> 07:50.171
Little Russ Potter.

07:50.204 --> 07:53.040
Gone off to the big city
and made some money.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.677
Or so they say.

07:56.711 --> 07:59.647
Now he's coming back
to share his Midas touch.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.051
My brother taught you
in eighth grade, I believe.

08:04.085 --> 08:05.786
Yep. He was a good man.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.522
He is a good man.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.158
But he's a lot poorer today
than he was yesterday.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.597
Now I'm not blaming you
for all of it.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.666
He chose to roll the dice,

08:18.699 --> 08:20.568
nobody made him do it.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.104
But he was led to believe

08:23.137 --> 08:25.873
that the odds were more
in his favor than they were.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.775
- I gave your brother...
- Really?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.610
...and all the investors,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.946
the most up to date information
that's available to me.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.014
You understand that?

08:33.047 --> 08:35.583
So much for the Midas touch.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.852
All right,
what are you accusing me of?

08:37.885 --> 08:39.687
If I'm not accusing you
of anything.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.022
Yeah, well, shit,
you could fooled me.

08:41.055 --> 08:42.790
- Fooling?
- Yeah.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.926
Now, there's a word I bet
you know a thing or two about.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.169
You might want to get that.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.306
I imagine there are
a lot of people around town

08:59.340 --> 09:00.641
that want to talk to you.

09:00.674 --> 09:06.814
And, Russ, I wouldn't
go jaywalking,

09:06.847 --> 09:12.787
or speeding at 26 or 27
miles an hour through a 25 zone.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.823
There's been a little
uptick in crime.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.291
We're trying to control it.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.859
You understand?

09:29.003 --> 09:30.304
This is Russ Potter.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.672
<i>Where will you be</i>

09:31.705 --> 09:33.307
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

09:33.340 --> 09:34.809
Excuse me?

09:37.678 --> 09:38.879
What the hell?

09:55.196 --> 09:59.300
Hello?

09:59.333 --> 10:02.236
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

10:02.269 --> 10:04.238
Who is this,
and how'd you get my number?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.240
<i>That ain't an answer.</i>

10:06.273 --> 10:07.908
Who the hell is this?

10:07.942 --> 10:09.777
<i>You'll soon find out.</i>

10:23.757 --> 10:26.760
- You okay?
- Yes, I, just zoned out
for a second.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.196
Yeah. Happens to me
all the time.

10:29.230 --> 10:31.365
Hey, Delaine said you're
coming up for supper tonight?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.033
Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.201
See you at 6:30.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.442
That is delicious beef stew.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.977
Compliments to the chef.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.812
Nobody makes it like Delaine.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.947
Well, I can't take the credit.

10:46.981 --> 10:48.883
I did get the recipe
from the diner.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.317
You did the cooking though.

10:52.153 --> 10:53.420
Well, I appreciate
you all having me.

10:53.454 --> 10:56.857
Uh, Delaine tells me
you had a rough day today.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.393
Yeah, you could say that.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.795
Oh, yeah.
Cecil Hammett threatened him.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.231
Cecil's an idiot.

11:04.265 --> 11:06.133
- Well--
- But he gets it natural.

11:06.167 --> 11:09.703
His old man was probably
the dumbest person I ever met.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.006
It's a wonder Cecil's
as bright as he is.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.074
- It was still scary.
- Mm.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.911
I hope other folks
took the news better.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.279
You know, a lot of people
don't know this,

11:18.312 --> 11:20.347
but, you know,
I lost a lot of money, as well.

11:21.482 --> 11:23.484
You know,
I'm hurtin' just like, uh,

11:23.518 --> 11:25.419
you know, everybody.
Maybe even more.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.356
And you're sure
Cecil's not a threat?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.793
No way. No.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.228
But, I mean...

11:34.261 --> 11:35.396
But?

11:39.133 --> 11:43.337
So, I got a, uh, call today,
sort of threatening.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.206
- I guess.
- Sort of?

11:45.239 --> 11:48.742
Hm. I got a call from a fellow
and he asked me,

11:48.776 --> 11:52.079
"Where will you be
the minute you wake up dead?"

11:55.082 --> 11:57.151
- That's eerie.
- Mm.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.520
You call the law?

11:58.553 --> 11:59.887
No.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.157
Well, why not?

12:03.190 --> 12:05.426
Well, I just felt like
he's trying to rattle me.

12:05.459 --> 12:06.794
You know?

12:07.928 --> 12:09.230
Russ...

12:09.263 --> 12:10.998
Don't mess around with this.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.166
You should call them.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.000
Delaine's right.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.902
You can't be
too careful nowadays,

12:14.935 --> 12:16.538
people are crazy.

12:16.571 --> 12:18.239
Maybe the police
can trace the call.

12:18.272 --> 12:21.275
No, I don't think so,
I mean, it came up
as an unknown caller.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.245
You gotta call the sheriff.

12:24.278 --> 12:27.881
Anyways, I don't wanna take up
any more your time.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.917
I appreciate the dinner.
Thanks again.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.485
Uh, hey,
let me walk you home.

12:31.519 --> 12:33.053
- Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.396
I-I thought I'd be
just honest with you--

12:42.429 --> 12:46.400
the stew had just a little
too much salt in it for me.

12:46.433 --> 12:50.104
Nice.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.006
Listen, I wanna
thank you for supper.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.307
- Oh.
- It was delicious.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.509
Any time.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.812
You feel like, uh, coming in?

12:58.846 --> 12:59.913
I'd love to.

13:02.517 --> 13:03.384
Come on in.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.286
Thank you.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.056
- Can I interest you in beer?
- Yeah, sure.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.491
- I could go for one.
- Nice.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.060
Yeah, I got them
in the garage.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.028
Let me go grab 'em.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.032
Oh, it's just Pernie.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.334
Hey, Pernie, what's up?

13:20.367 --> 13:21.168
<i>Sorry to bother, Russ,</i>

13:21.201 --> 13:23.538
<i>Horace's medical report</i>
<i>came back.</i>

13:23.571 --> 13:26.373
- Yeah?
<i>- Not looking good</i>
<i>for the poor fella.</i>

13:26.407 --> 13:29.076
- Okay.
<i>- Is it okay if I stay</i> <i>with Horace for a bit?</i>

13:29.109 --> 13:32.446
Pernie, listen, just take
as much time as you want.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.148
- All right?
<i>- Sure.</i>

13:34.181 --> 13:35.550
If you want to take
two, three days off,

13:35.583 --> 13:37.217
that's totally fine. Okay?

13:37.251 --> 13:39.186
<i>I just hate to</i>
<i>leave you right now.</i>

13:39.219 --> 13:41.088
No, I want you just to relax.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.290
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Yep.

13:43.324 --> 13:47.494
Pernie, just take care
of Horace. All right?

13:47.529 --> 13:49.196
<i>Thank you, Russ.</i>

13:49.229 --> 13:50.998
- Okay.
<i>- Thank you, thank you.</i>

13:51.031 --> 13:52.600
I'm sorry, honey.
Good night.

13:52.634 --> 13:54.301
<i>I so appreciate it. Bye.</i>

13:57.004 --> 13:59.106
Everything all right?

13:59.139 --> 14:02.876
Pernie's, uh, afraid her
husband's cancer came back.

14:02.910 --> 14:03.844
Oh.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.882
Well, speaking of which,

14:09.584 --> 14:11.185
how's your dad doing?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.420
Mm. He's fine.

14:13.454 --> 14:14.656
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:14.689 --> 14:16.423
Been cancer free
for about a year now.

14:16.457 --> 14:18.425
You know,
I-I wanted to ask him,

14:18.459 --> 14:20.327
but I just kind of
felt odd about it.

14:20.361 --> 14:22.530
You can ask him, he don't mind.

14:22.564 --> 14:25.032
There's something
that I'm curious about.

14:26.367 --> 14:27.434
What's that?

14:27.468 --> 14:29.870
Why haven't you been married?

14:33.340 --> 14:36.377
So you feel odd
asking about my daddy's health,

14:36.410 --> 14:39.113
but you're just fine
asking my love life?

14:40.347 --> 14:43.317
Uh, well, uh, hm...

14:43.350 --> 14:47.054
Let's just say the pickens
in Bare Hollow are kinda slim,

14:47.087 --> 14:48.590
if you hadn't noticed.

14:49.591 --> 14:51.992
So why have you stayed?

14:52.025 --> 14:55.329
Daddy, mostly.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.198
Besides, I've been here
my whole life.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.935
I don't know where I'm go
or what I'd do when I got there.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.203
Hm.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.309
You know,
I'm gonna tell you something...

15:11.044 --> 15:14.616
I've had a crush on you
since high school.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.318
- You never let on.
- Mm-mm.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.320
How come?

15:20.354 --> 15:22.222
Well, I mean, you know,

15:22.256 --> 15:24.659
you were kinda part of
the popular crew

15:24.692 --> 15:27.529
and I just-- shit,
I didn't think you were
that interested in me.

15:27.562 --> 15:34.401
So... would that be
the reason that you
rented this house?

15:35.637 --> 15:36.470
No, no, no, no, no.

15:36.504 --> 15:38.405
So-so the price was right,
obviously.

15:38.439 --> 15:40.007
- Mm-hm.
- As you know,
and then, you know,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.610
I thought, well, you know...

15:42.644 --> 15:45.412
It ain't so bad to be next to
the prettiest girl in town.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.384
Hm.

16:17.211 --> 16:19.313
- All right.
- You don't--

16:31.124 --> 16:35.262
- Yeah?
-  - <i>Where will you</i> <i>be the minute you wake up dead?</i>

16:35.295 --> 16:37.364
Hey, I want you
to listen to me.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.366
Fuck you.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.467
You hear me?

16:40.502 --> 16:42.504
<i>You'll find out.</i>

16:42.537 --> 16:43.705
Son of a bitch.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.708
Wait...

16:46.741 --> 16:50.277
- Wait, was that the caller?
- Yeah.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.514
Okay, Russ,
you gotta promise me

16:52.547 --> 16:55.249
that you'll see Sheriff Fowler
in the morning.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.483
I promise.

16:56.518 --> 16:58.318
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.751
You got any plans
this weekend?

17:29.784 --> 17:30.450
I might.

17:32.620 --> 17:33.755
What's going on Tillman?

17:33.788 --> 17:35.489
Hey, good morning, Russ.

17:35.523 --> 17:37.257
- Thurmond in?
- Yep.

17:37.291 --> 17:38.425
Thank you.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.065
Yeah.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.270
May I?

17:50.304 --> 17:51.204
Yeah.

17:52.674 --> 17:55.810
Well, I've been getting
some threatening phone calls

17:55.843 --> 17:57.144
I wanted to talk to you about.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.147
Threatening phone calls.

18:00.815 --> 18:02.115
Shocking.

18:02.817 --> 18:04.184
From?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.452
Well, I don't know.

18:07.855 --> 18:09.591
From more than one person?

18:09.624 --> 18:12.426
I mean, it seems like
the same person

18:12.459 --> 18:14.696
How old?

18:14.729 --> 18:18.165
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd probably say
he's younger than older.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.634
How many calls?

18:20.535 --> 18:21.736
Three so far.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.574
So, what exactly
did he say to you?

18:26.608 --> 18:29.744
Where will you be
the minute you wake up dead?

18:29.777 --> 18:31.278
That's it?

18:31.311 --> 18:34.549
What do you mean, that's it?
Yeah, that's it.

18:34.582 --> 18:38.418
- You get a number?
- No, it's coming from
an unknown number.

18:38.452 --> 18:43.524
Eh, it's likely somebody
upset with you over the merger.

18:43.558 --> 18:46.861
Or the, uh... non-merger.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.599
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

18:51.633 --> 18:55.235
- Hm.
- I mean, if he wanted to
kill you, you'd be dead by now.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.271
You know what, Sheriff,
that's-that's really
comforting.

18:58.305 --> 19:01.743
But what happens
if the calls continue?

19:01.776 --> 19:03.778
- What do you do?
- Ah.

19:03.811 --> 19:06.279
They'll probably get tired of it
when they find out

19:06.313 --> 19:08.750
that they can't
get you flustered.

19:08.783 --> 19:09.651
So that's it?

19:09.684 --> 19:11.184
All I can do.

19:11.218 --> 19:11.886
- Yeah.
- For now.

19:11.919 --> 19:13.286
You're right.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.667
- Mm.
- There you go.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.701
Thank you.

19:26.734 --> 19:28.268
So, did you go?

19:28.301 --> 19:30.538
To the sheriff?
Yeah, I went.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.339
And?

19:32.372 --> 19:35.510
Delaine, he don't give a shit.
Come on, now.

19:35.543 --> 19:37.645
Well, that's the last time
I'm gonna vote for him.

19:38.813 --> 19:39.647
Well,
what are you gonna do?

19:39.681 --> 19:41.481
I don't know, I mean,
I'll probably just

19:41.516 --> 19:42.583
ignore the calls.

19:44.786 --> 19:50.190
- Hm.
- More importantly though,
last night was perfect.

19:51.425 --> 19:53.360
I know.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.930
I would love to
hit the rewind switch,
if you know what I mean.

19:55.963 --> 19:58.231
Mm-hm.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.901
Well, I'm working
the supper shift tonight,

19:59.934 --> 20:02.469
but, uh, tomorrow night?

20:02.503 --> 20:04.772
Nah, I can't do it tomorrow,
I'm busy.

20:04.806 --> 20:07.642
You ain't got no plans,
nobody likes you right now.

20:08.876 --> 20:09.944
All right, I'll be there.

20:09.977 --> 20:11.913
- All right, then.
- Mm-hm.

20:28.763 --> 20:30.464
This is Russ Potter here.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.935
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

20:33.968 --> 20:37.471
Listen to me,
if you're trying to scare me,
it's not working.

20:37.505 --> 20:39.473
You hear me? It's not working.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.482
<i>Go!</i>

22:55.843 --> 22:57.044
Delaine, honey.

22:57.078 --> 22:59.914
I'm sorry.
I just heard, I'm sorry.

22:59.947 --> 23:03.584
I don't understand it.
Who'd wanna kill Daddy?

23:03.618 --> 23:05.620
Okay, let's go inside.
Come on.

23:14.729 --> 23:19.600
I know this is difficult,
but I have to ask
some questions.

23:20.635 --> 23:22.169
When did you find your daddy?

23:23.638 --> 23:26.874
Uh, after I come home

23:26.908 --> 23:29.543
from the breakfast shift
at the diner.

23:29.577 --> 23:30.878
What time was that?

23:32.479 --> 23:34.715
Around ten o'clock.

23:34.749 --> 23:36.150
Thurmond, can't this wait?

23:36.183 --> 23:38.819
No. No, it cannot.

23:42.089 --> 23:44.191
According to the coroner,

23:44.225 --> 23:46.994
Carl was killed
sometime before midnight.

23:48.663 --> 23:51.565
When did you last see him?

23:51.599 --> 23:54.135
Uh, just before I left
for the supper shift.

23:54.168 --> 23:56.671
Did your daddy have any enemies?

23:56.704 --> 24:01.742
Anybody he had recently
had a quarrel or...
a disagreement with?

24:01.776 --> 24:05.046
- No.
- Did he owe money to anybody?

24:06.080 --> 24:06.948
No.

24:06.981 --> 24:08.516
Anything missing?

24:09.517 --> 24:11.085
Not that I know of.

24:12.987 --> 24:16.691
Don't understand.
Somebody wanted
your father dead.

24:17.992 --> 24:19.860
- Thurmond.
- What?

24:19.894 --> 24:21.896
What if Carl wasn't the target?

24:21.929 --> 24:23.496
What do you mean?

24:23.531 --> 24:26.534
Well, I've been telling you
that I've been getting
threatening phone calls, right?

24:26.567 --> 24:27.668
So?

24:28.636 --> 24:29.870
Well, maybe I was the target.

24:29.904 --> 24:32.506
- You? How?
- Yeah.

24:32.540 --> 24:34.875
I mean, it could've been wrong.
Shit, I live right next door.

24:34.909 --> 24:36.978
- Wrong house?
- Mm-hm.

24:38.079 --> 24:40.014
Well, I suppose it's possible,

24:40.047 --> 24:43.884
but I would think
that anybody who
wanted to kill you

24:43.918 --> 24:44.919
would know where you live.

24:46.253 --> 24:47.755
It's a small town.

24:49.957 --> 24:51.792
Who lost the most?

24:51.826 --> 24:53.561
I mean,
I don't know that off hand,

24:53.594 --> 24:57.631
I would have to check but...
I mean, people lost...

24:57.665 --> 24:59.700
thousands and thousands
of dollars.

25:01.102 --> 25:03.637
Might be.

25:03.671 --> 25:08.776
I heard of it happening
a few years back
down in Jones County.

25:08.809 --> 25:14.015
A man hired a hit man
to kill his wife's lover,
but gave him the wrong address.

25:14.048 --> 25:16.784
Wound up splitting the throat
of a local preacher.

25:18.052 --> 25:20.654
- It's all your fault, Thurmond.
- Hm?

25:20.688 --> 25:24.191
If you had just listened to Russ
when he come you,

25:24.225 --> 25:26.027
my daddy might not be dead.

25:26.060 --> 25:28.662
Come on, now.
We don't know what happened.

25:28.696 --> 25:30.765
Let's not go pointing fingers
just yet.

25:33.034 --> 25:36.670
Russ, I'm gonna need the names,
phone numbers and addresses

25:36.704 --> 25:39.607
of all the people
who lost money.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.776
I'll get it to you
tomorrow morning.

25:41.809 --> 25:43.811
Ah, it's gonna take some time.

25:45.312 --> 25:49.984
Ah, again,
I'm-I'm sorry for your loss.

25:50.017 --> 25:51.886
But we'll find out
who did this.

25:51.919 --> 25:53.220
I promise you.

25:53.254 --> 25:54.889
Yeah, well, I hold you to that.

25:54.922 --> 25:55.990
Please do.

25:57.358 --> 25:59.560
I'll get back to you
when I know more.

26:04.732 --> 26:05.900
Delaine.

26:07.334 --> 26:08.269
Mm.

26:09.737 --> 26:12.173
Hey, what can I do for you?

26:12.206 --> 26:13.974
Can I just
stay with you for a while?

26:14.008 --> 26:16.010
Of course.

26:16.043 --> 26:19.747
'Cause I can't stand
the thought of being here
with Dad gone.

26:19.780 --> 26:22.016
Of course.
Stay as long as you want.

26:22.049 --> 26:23.250
Hey, come here.

26:27.221 --> 26:30.057
Can't believe
somebody's so mad at you,
they'd want to kill you.

26:30.091 --> 26:31.659
Mm-hm.

26:31.692 --> 26:33.828
Well, it can be
a wicked world, can't it?

26:33.861 --> 26:34.862
Hm.

26:35.729 --> 26:37.364
Are you still religious?

26:39.266 --> 26:40.701
No.

26:41.802 --> 26:43.070
Why not?

26:43.104 --> 26:46.407
I've rode the-the devil's back
way too many times.

26:46.440 --> 26:50.144
I might burn up if I walk into
a church at this point.

26:50.177 --> 26:52.313
Is that why you come home?

26:52.346 --> 26:53.914
Yeah. I mean,
I needed to plug in.

26:53.948 --> 26:55.149
I mean, why not here at home?

26:55.182 --> 26:56.183
Hm.

27:02.790 --> 27:04.925
You're still going to church.

27:04.959 --> 27:08.262
My mama was strict about it,
but...

27:08.295 --> 27:13.400
after she died
from taking ammonia
we never went back.

27:13.434 --> 27:16.137
- Hm.
- Daddy blamed God
for taking her from him.

27:16.170 --> 27:18.639
Just... couldn't forgive Him.

27:23.244 --> 27:26.080
You know what I've never
understood about religion?

27:26.113 --> 27:27.848
What?

27:27.882 --> 27:29.884
Well, are we sinners
because we sin,

27:29.917 --> 27:33.821
or do we sin
because we're born sinners?

27:33.854 --> 27:39.960
And if it's the latter,
then what right
does God have to judge us?

27:39.994 --> 27:41.028
Hm?

27:42.463 --> 27:45.466
If you ever figure it out,
let me know.

28:01.015 --> 28:03.117
I got all the information
that you asked for:

28:03.150 --> 28:06.120
names, addresses,
phone numbers,

28:06.153 --> 28:07.821
and exactly
what they invested.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.390
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:16.430 --> 28:20.367
I'm sorry for not taking you
more seriously about
these phone calls.

28:20.401 --> 28:22.069
Mm.

28:22.102 --> 28:23.204
You got anymore?

28:23.237 --> 28:25.906
No, no,
not since Carl was killed.

28:27.274 --> 28:30.512
You really think
it's the wrong house?

28:30.545 --> 28:32.846
And you knew Carl pretty well,
didn't you?

28:32.880 --> 28:36.050
No, I mean, I moved in
two months ago
and met him there.

28:36.083 --> 28:39.053
Ever see any
suspicious people over?

28:39.086 --> 28:41.956
No. I mean, he didn't seem like
the kinda person
that got in trouble.

28:41.989 --> 28:44.258
I mean, if you ask me,
he was a gentle soul.

28:44.291 --> 28:47.361
So, wrong house is still
the best theory then.

28:48.929 --> 28:49.797
Yeah.

28:49.830 --> 28:51.465
Let me know if you
need anything else.

28:52.199 --> 28:53.300
Uh, Russ.

28:54.201 --> 28:55.135
Be careful.

28:56.136 --> 28:57.771
Any of this theory is correct,

28:57.805 --> 28:59.406
this guy may not be done.

29:28.068 --> 29:30.204
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:30.237 --> 29:31.805
What are you doing?

29:31.839 --> 29:36.810
I'm, uh, getting rid of
some of Daddy's things.

29:36.844 --> 29:39.413
I thought you weren't ready
to go back in the house yet.

29:40.548 --> 29:42.483
I'm not, really.

29:42.517 --> 29:46.186
Just didn't want to
put it off for too long.

29:46.220 --> 29:49.524
What about these?
Where do you want 'em?

29:49.557 --> 29:51.859
You can set him right there.
I'll get him in a sec.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.227
Thanks.

29:55.530 --> 29:58.899
- Who's that Delaine?
- That's Lucius.

29:58.932 --> 30:01.468
You might have seen him work in
the kitchen at the diner.

30:01.503 --> 30:03.003
No, no.

30:03.037 --> 30:05.339
Well, I thought he could use
a little extra money,

30:05.372 --> 30:07.509
so I asked him to help me
pack up the house.

30:08.942 --> 30:10.844
So you're moving, huh?
That's it.

30:12.212 --> 30:13.380
Yeah.

30:13.414 --> 30:16.050
Yeah, I'm gonna sell it.

30:16.083 --> 30:19.219
I can't live here no more
after what happened.

30:19.253 --> 30:21.589
- You understand.
- Of course, yeah.

30:21.623 --> 30:24.992
Just, uh...
seems a bit sudden is all.

30:25.025 --> 30:27.294
I know.

30:27.328 --> 30:30.197
It's not like I'm-I'm moving
today or tomorrow.

30:30.230 --> 30:33.300
Right.
Yeah, all right.

30:33.334 --> 30:36.103
Well, shit, let me know
if you need anything.

30:36.136 --> 30:39.574
- Ru-- Hey, Russ.
- I think I may have lost
one of my gold hoop earrings

30:39.607 --> 30:41.942
at your house,
so if you come across it,
let me know.

30:41.975 --> 30:45.979
Daddy gave them to me, so...

30:46.013 --> 30:47.247
All right, will do.

30:59.326 --> 31:00.327
Hey.

31:00.361 --> 31:01.995
You shouldn't have come out
when he was there,

31:02.029 --> 31:03.897
he might have
recognized your voice.

31:03.931 --> 31:05.933
I didn't know he was there
until I stepped out.

31:05.966 --> 31:08.435
Hey, you said
he wouldn't be home.

31:08.469 --> 31:10.070
He wasn't supposed to be.

31:10.104 --> 31:12.339
Well, now my fault then.

31:12.373 --> 31:14.942
- When do I get my money?
- Soon enough.

31:14.975 --> 31:17.111
- Well, when?
- When the check comes in.

31:17.144 --> 31:19.581
We have been through this.
Relax.

31:19.614 --> 31:21.215
Yeah, easy for you to say.

31:21.248 --> 31:23.150
I owe people money.
I told you that.

31:23.183 --> 31:25.587
And they won't wait,
so I can't wait.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.555
It's just a few more days.

31:27.589 --> 31:28.590
Hey.

31:33.293 --> 31:34.662
Hm.

31:34.696 --> 31:36.631
Money will be here any day now.

31:36.664 --> 31:39.099
You'll see.

31:39.133 --> 31:40.702
- Well, it better be.
- Mm-hm.

31:42.604 --> 31:44.706
Shit!

31:44.739 --> 31:47.374
I found your earring.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.110
Where on Earth did you find it?

31:50.144 --> 31:52.045
Under the couch.
Soon as you walk in.

31:53.247 --> 31:56.016
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

31:56.049 --> 31:57.552
I gotta get back to the office.

31:57.585 --> 31:58.986
I'll see you soon.

31:59.019 --> 32:00.220
Okay. Bye.

32:02.022 --> 32:04.491
Did you threaten Russ Potter?

32:06.193 --> 32:07.961
Well...

32:07.995 --> 32:09.196
Well, what?

32:10.230 --> 32:12.299
Sorta, yeah.

32:12.332 --> 32:14.968
But not really.

32:15.002 --> 32:18.005
Well, which is it?
You did, or you didn't?

32:19.139 --> 32:20.274
Well, I did.

32:20.307 --> 32:22.209
But-but I didn't mean it.

32:22.242 --> 32:24.646
I mean, I-I meant it at the time
but-but not now.

32:24.679 --> 32:26.013
I wouldn't hurt nobody.

32:26.046 --> 32:27.582
How much did you invest?

32:29.049 --> 32:31.452
Oh, well, I--
I'd rather not say.

32:31.485 --> 32:33.320
Ten-thousand
sound about right?

32:34.722 --> 32:36.290
Oh, gosh all mighty, darn.

32:36.323 --> 32:38.192
If you knew then why'd you ask?

32:38.225 --> 32:41.061
Awful lot of money to lose.

32:41.094 --> 32:42.630
You sure you didn't mean it?

32:43.565 --> 32:45.265
No. Oh, no.

32:45.299 --> 32:47.367
Like I said,
I meant it at the time.

32:47.401 --> 32:49.671
I was mad.
Hell, I was more than mad.

32:49.704 --> 32:50.605
I wanted to hurt him.

32:52.272 --> 32:54.609
- But now...
- Now what?

32:56.076 --> 32:58.546
I decided to forgive Russ.

32:58.580 --> 33:00.314
It's the Christian thing to do.

33:00.347 --> 33:03.651
- Let me ask you a question.
- Shoot.

33:03.685 --> 33:06.253
Where will you be
the minute to wake up dead?

33:07.555 --> 33:09.323
Pardon?

33:09.356 --> 33:13.227
Where will you be,
the minute you wake up dead?

33:14.495 --> 33:16.063
I don't understand.

33:18.766 --> 33:21.468
No, I don't think you do, Cecil.

33:21.503 --> 33:23.538
All right. You can go.

33:24.572 --> 33:26.508
What kind of question is that?

33:26.541 --> 33:29.476
I said you can go, Cecil.
Bye.

33:30.712 --> 33:32.179
Fine.

33:32.212 --> 33:33.447
You ask crazy questions.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.282
I'll just carry my ass
outta here.

33:41.856 --> 33:44.124
And the insurance company
you wanted,

33:44.157 --> 33:45.325
it's on line one.

34:10.718 --> 34:12.452
Evening, Lucius.

34:12.486 --> 34:16.791
- Look, I know I'm behind.
- Yeah, you're way behind.

34:16.824 --> 34:19.794
But I'm about to
come into a lot of money.

34:19.827 --> 34:23.230
- You know, I just need--
- I just need you

34:23.263 --> 34:24.532
to give me my money.

34:24.566 --> 34:26.601
Look, and you're gonna get it.

34:27.835 --> 34:29.369
But that's what you
said last week.

34:29.403 --> 34:31.405
Oh, but I did a job.

34:31.438 --> 34:34.141
It's gonna pay everything.

34:34.174 --> 34:36.476
What kind of job did you do,

34:36.511 --> 34:39.514
that's gonna pay you 5k?

34:39.547 --> 34:40.748
I killed a man.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.520
- You killed a man?
- Yeah.

34:45.553 --> 34:47.622
Who'd you kill, Lucius?

34:47.655 --> 34:49.222
Carl Moore.

34:50.858 --> 34:52.527
Oh, anyhow.

34:52.560 --> 34:57.397
Yeah, I work with his daughter
Delaine at the diner.

34:57.431 --> 35:03.337
And she wanted him killed
to collect a shit load
of insurance money.

35:03.370 --> 35:06.273
- So, I just need--
- I just need!

35:06.306 --> 35:08.610
I mean, there you go again
with the I just needs.

35:08.643 --> 35:10.377
And so what I need you to know,

35:10.410 --> 35:13.715
is I just need
my motherfucking money.

35:13.748 --> 35:15.449
Just a couple more days.

35:15.482 --> 35:16.684
Just a couple more days.

35:16.718 --> 35:18.485
Couple more days!

35:18.519 --> 35:21.623
Just a couple more days!

35:21.656 --> 35:23.558
You sound like
a 12-year-old child!

35:23.591 --> 35:25.760
- I swear!
- Oh, you swear, huh?

35:26.694 --> 35:28.830
Really shouldn't swear.

35:28.863 --> 35:30.497
Says so in the bible.

35:30.531 --> 35:32.900
You know what else
is in the bible?

35:32.934 --> 35:36.838
He who beareth false witness,

35:36.871 --> 35:38.906
that man shall perish.

35:38.940 --> 35:40.474
Yeah, faith in youth.

35:41.509 --> 35:42.910
Mace.

35:45.513 --> 35:47.949
Hey--
Jody!

35:47.982 --> 35:50.183
- There's no need!
- Mace!

35:50.217 --> 35:51.385
What are you doing?

35:52.820 --> 35:53.921
Man's a fry cook.

35:53.955 --> 35:56.824
He needs his hands
to make a living!

35:56.858 --> 35:58.358
Use your brain!

35:58.392 --> 36:01.261
How's he supposed to pay us,
if he ain't got no hands?

36:02.964 --> 36:04.331
Take off your shoe.

36:05.633 --> 36:07.367
Take off your shoe.

36:07.401 --> 36:10.605
- Jody, please.
- Take off your shoe
and your goddamn sock.

36:10.638 --> 36:12.439
Take off your shoe!

36:12.472 --> 36:14.207
Jody, no, please!

36:14.241 --> 36:16.309
Come on, now!

36:16.343 --> 36:18.579
Guys, we're all friends here!

36:19.246 --> 36:20.247
Oh...

36:27.287 --> 36:28.255
Stay still.

36:30.290 --> 36:34.294
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
not the pinky toe.

36:34.327 --> 36:36.998
Pink toe's important.

36:37.031 --> 36:39.366
Next to the big toe
it's probably
the most important.

36:39.399 --> 36:40.802
You need it for balance.

36:40.835 --> 36:43.336
Now that third and fourth toe,

36:43.370 --> 36:44.806
they ain't so important.

36:44.839 --> 36:46.607
Well, which one?

36:46.641 --> 36:48.009
Three or four?

36:48.042 --> 36:52.513
You know what,
I'm feeling sporting.

36:52.547 --> 36:54.414
Why don't you pick, Lucius.

36:54.448 --> 36:55.683
What?

36:56.684 --> 36:58.953
No, no, I can't pick.

36:58.986 --> 37:01.723
Well, you're gonna pick,
or we're gonna take them both.

37:03.591 --> 37:04.625
Fourth.

37:04.659 --> 37:06.561
Why'd you pick four?

37:06.594 --> 37:07.695
It's smaller.

37:08.930 --> 37:10.297
So it is.

37:11.364 --> 37:13.000
Don't do this.

37:26.346 --> 37:28.583
Oh, my toe!

37:30.585 --> 37:33.588
Ah, you gonna give me
my money by tomorrow.

37:33.621 --> 37:34.856
Or you're gonna have
matching feet.

37:45.032 --> 37:46.968
...took my toe!

37:52.840 --> 37:56.077
Look, I ain't foolin'!
I just got my toe cut off!

37:56.110 --> 37:59.446
- What?
- With a bolt cutter!

37:59.479 --> 38:02.016
Now give me some damn money!

38:02.049 --> 38:06.053
Okay. Okay.
I'll get you some money.

38:06.087 --> 38:07.287
Okay?

38:10.925 --> 38:13.561
Okay, here, here.

38:13.594 --> 38:15.029
Now that's all I got.

38:15.062 --> 38:16.496
What is this?

38:16.531 --> 38:19.934
One... three...
20... 40...

38:19.967 --> 38:21.602
Sixty-three dollars!

38:21.636 --> 38:24.806
I told you,
that's all I got.

38:24.839 --> 38:26.473
Tips were short tonight.

38:26.507 --> 38:29.409
Well, then go to an ATM.

38:29.442 --> 38:32.680
I don't got
nothing in the bank.

38:32.713 --> 38:36.884
Oh, you owe me five grand.

38:36.918 --> 38:38.485
And you'll get it.

38:38.519 --> 38:41.622
I'm broke, too. Why do you think
I'm doing all this, huh?

38:41.656 --> 38:43.390
I need the money
just as bad as you do.

38:43.423 --> 38:45.392
I doubt that!

38:45.425 --> 38:47.795
You still got all your toes.

38:47.829 --> 38:51.398
Now, you need to give me
some serious money or I'll--

38:51.431 --> 38:53.568
Or you'll what? Hm?

38:53.601 --> 38:56.469
You're the murderer here.

38:56.504 --> 38:59.106
Well, I'll do you
what I did to your daddy.

38:59.140 --> 39:01.042
Oh, are you threatening me?

39:01.075 --> 39:03.978
Now, how would you
get your money then, genius?

39:04.011 --> 39:04.879
Soon!

39:09.617 --> 39:12.553
<i>What can you tell me</i>
<i>about Lucius McFalls?</i>

39:12.587 --> 39:13.521
Your cook.

39:15.156 --> 39:18.391
Well, he seems like
a decent enough guy.

39:18.425 --> 39:19.627
Good cook.

39:19.660 --> 39:23.097
Well, not great
but good enough.

39:23.130 --> 39:25.733
He gets a little hot-headed
every now and then,

39:25.766 --> 39:28.669
but other than that
I got no complaints.

39:28.703 --> 39:29.770
Is he in trouble?

39:29.804 --> 39:31.438
Not sure yet.

39:32.506 --> 39:34.441
What about Delaine?

39:34.474 --> 39:35.810
She cause you any trouble?

39:35.843 --> 39:37.979
She is a good waitress.

39:38.012 --> 39:40.447
Real personable,
people like her,

39:40.480 --> 39:42.149
especially with men...

39:42.183 --> 39:43.751
...she's a little flirty.

39:43.784 --> 39:45.786
But she's a hard worker.

39:45.820 --> 39:48.823
She been doing a lot
of extra shifts lately.

39:49.991 --> 39:51.125
Why?

39:51.158 --> 39:55.096
Because she owes me some money.

39:56.898 --> 39:57.798
Why?

39:57.832 --> 40:00.167
Oh, come on, Thurmond.

40:00.201 --> 40:02.637
You know, I don't like to
speak ill of the dead,

40:02.670 --> 40:06.674
but her and her old man, they...
they liked to gamble,

40:06.707 --> 40:08.843
mostly on the internet,
I think.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.149
She and Lucius friends?

40:15.182 --> 40:17.685
I see 'em talking
from time to time,

40:17.718 --> 40:20.187
but she talks to everybody.

40:20.221 --> 40:22.089
What's this all about, Thurmond?

40:24.759 --> 40:26.560
I wish I knew, Dewey.

40:29.664 --> 40:30.965
I wish I knew.

40:38.773 --> 40:40.975
Can I have a piece
of cherry pie to go?

41:50.644 --> 41:52.179
License and registration,
please.

41:53.147 --> 41:55.049
I wasn't doin' nothing.

41:55.082 --> 41:56.917
License and registration.

42:00.721 --> 42:03.090
What did I do?

42:03.124 --> 42:05.226
You were blocking
two parking spaces.

42:05.259 --> 42:06.227
Huh?

42:06.260 --> 42:08.329
Were straddling the line.

42:08.362 --> 42:11.632
There's a town ordinance
against that.

42:11.665 --> 42:13.334
There's no one in the lot.

42:13.367 --> 42:15.302
Law's the law, son.

42:15.336 --> 42:16.837
It's called a gateway crime.

42:16.871 --> 42:19.573
You got to be shittin', me, man.

42:20.641 --> 42:21.876
Sorry, sir.

42:24.612 --> 42:26.814
You ever get over to
the west part of town?

42:26.847 --> 42:29.050
Ah, I haven't been over
that way in a while,

42:29.083 --> 42:31.285
You know,
probably a month or longer.

42:31.318 --> 42:33.154
A month or longer?

42:33.187 --> 42:35.990
- You're sure about that?
- Mm-hm.

42:36.023 --> 42:40.361
Don't go over there
to see Delaine Moore, maybe?

42:40.394 --> 42:42.763
I wouldn't blame you
if you did.

42:42.797 --> 42:44.765
Mighty good looking woman?

42:44.799 --> 42:48.069
Hell, if I was younger,
I'd try to see her myself.

42:48.102 --> 42:51.305
I work with her.
And that's it.

42:51.338 --> 42:54.708
Hm. Then you're dumber
than I thought.

42:57.278 --> 42:58.612
Are we done?

42:59.914 --> 43:00.815
For now.

43:01.882 --> 43:03.918
Take this is as a warning.

43:03.951 --> 43:05.886
Next time I write you a ticket.

43:57.338 --> 43:58.305
Hello?

43:58.339 --> 43:59.373
<i>Where will you be</i>

43:59.406 --> 44:01.809
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

44:01.842 --> 44:05.746
Lucius.
Lucius, that ain't funny.

44:05.779 --> 44:08.048
<i>You'll soon find out.</i>

44:26.400 --> 44:27.768
Hey, sweetheart.

44:27.801 --> 44:29.270
Hey, Russ.

44:29.303 --> 44:30.471
Yeah, what's going on?

44:30.505 --> 44:32.106
Um...

44:32.139 --> 44:34.742
Could I maybe
stay at your place tonight,

44:34.775 --> 44:37.111
or well, for a couple of nights?

44:37.144 --> 44:40.247
Delaine, I've told you before,
you can stay
as long as you want.

44:40.281 --> 44:42.049
Thank you.

44:42.082 --> 44:44.118
You're good man,
Charlie Brown.

44:44.151 --> 44:45.786
I look forward to it.
See you tonight.

44:45.819 --> 44:47.254
Okay.

45:06.073 --> 45:07.775
You gonna get that, Delaine?

45:08.776 --> 45:10.778
Mm. No.

45:10.811 --> 45:13.414
It's probably just somebody
trying to sell me something.

45:13.447 --> 45:15.916
Been gettin' a lot
of them calls lately.

45:15.950 --> 45:17.351
Ah, it could be the sheriff.

45:17.384 --> 45:19.820
Might have some news
about the investigation.

45:21.021 --> 45:23.257
Fine.

45:29.196 --> 45:30.397
Hello.

45:30.431 --> 45:31.498
<i>Where will you be</i>

45:31.533 --> 45:33.467
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

45:33.500 --> 45:34.969
Sorry, I'm not interested.

45:35.002 --> 45:37.805
So, please don't call
this number no more.

45:39.039 --> 45:41.342
Mm, that's annoying.

45:41.375 --> 45:43.043
Maybe you ought to
block the caller.

45:43.077 --> 45:44.845
Good idea.

45:52.386 --> 45:53.787
I got your money.

45:54.321 --> 45:56.457
About time.

45:56.490 --> 45:58.459
No, it's too risky
to give it to you here.

45:58.492 --> 46:00.828
Oh, so I'll come
to your place later.

46:00.861 --> 46:02.129
No, Russ might see you.

46:02.162 --> 46:04.932
We got to meet somewhere else.

46:04.965 --> 46:07.301
How about I come
to your place tonight?

46:07.334 --> 46:08.302
Fine with me.

46:08.335 --> 46:11.972
I can bring us some wine.
We can celebrate.

46:12.006 --> 46:13.274
You got all of it?

46:13.307 --> 46:15.943
Oh, you'll get
everything that's coming to you.

46:15.976 --> 46:17.344
I promise.

46:17.378 --> 46:18.812
Honest to God.

47:03.057 --> 47:06.226
Knock, knock.

47:06.260 --> 47:07.629
Well, hi, over there.

47:07.662 --> 47:12.232
I, uh, love what you've, uh,
done with your place.

47:17.104 --> 47:19.473
Brought the wine,
as promised.

47:19.507 --> 47:21.442
You'd better have
more than wine in there.

47:21.475 --> 47:22.910
Oh, I do.

47:25.412 --> 47:27.414
I ain't got no wine glasses.

47:27.448 --> 47:29.383
Well, I didn't expect you did,

47:29.416 --> 47:32.986
so...voilà.

47:33.020 --> 47:35.155
I told you, I ain't
much of a wine drinker.

47:35.189 --> 47:37.424
Look, I'll just have a beer.

47:37.458 --> 47:39.026
I think you're gonna like this.

47:39.059 --> 47:40.361
It's French.

47:40.394 --> 47:44.264
And I've been saving it
for a very special occasion.

47:44.298 --> 47:47.167
- Hm.
- Come on, just try it.

47:47.201 --> 47:48.969
Might find yourself surprised.

47:51.639 --> 47:56.176
To us, to a perfect plan
and getting rich.

47:58.245 --> 48:00.180
Hm.

48:00.214 --> 48:01.248
You first.

48:02.449 --> 48:04.017
What, you don't trust me?

48:04.051 --> 48:05.919
Mm-mm.
Why would I?

48:11.024 --> 48:11.992
Mmm.

48:14.128 --> 48:15.396
Satisfied?

48:21.135 --> 48:22.604
Ain't it good?

48:22.637 --> 48:24.672
Eh, it's a little sour.

48:24.706 --> 48:27.107
Lucius, you gotta
broaden your horizons.

48:27.141 --> 48:29.243
You're about to become
a very rich man.

48:29.276 --> 48:32.279
No, not after I pay out
all the money I owe.

48:32.312 --> 48:36.383
Well, I think you
should keep some of the money
for yourself and enjoy it.

48:36.417 --> 48:38.185
Treat yourself to some...

48:38.218 --> 48:41.488
...imported beer
or some good whiskey or bourbon.

48:43.257 --> 48:46.260
Just give me the money.

48:46.293 --> 48:48.295
Patience is a virtue, you know.

48:49.430 --> 48:50.532
Mm-hm.

48:51.566 --> 48:52.534
Mm.

48:56.403 --> 48:57.572
Yeah.

48:59.707 --> 49:01.709
It's all gonna be all right.

49:06.046 --> 49:07.448
Gonna be over soon.

49:08.415 --> 49:10.250
How?

49:10.284 --> 49:14.421
Well, poison was in the glass
before I poured the wine.

49:14.455 --> 49:17.224
It's amazing what you can learn
on the internet.

49:17.257 --> 49:18.693
Why?

49:20.127 --> 49:22.730
Well, if you
had just been patient,

49:22.764 --> 49:24.599
none of this
would have been necessary.

49:24.632 --> 49:27.635
'Cause everything
was going so well.

49:27.669 --> 49:32.406
But then you had to go
and make those phone calls
and threaten me.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.509
Calls?

49:34.542 --> 49:36.443
I didn't...

49:36.477 --> 49:38.378
I didn't, I swear.

49:38.412 --> 49:41.114
Now you only have
yourself to blame, Lucius.

49:41.749 --> 49:43.551
Look at it this way.

49:43.585 --> 49:48.723
You're about to uncover
the great enduring mystery.

49:48.756 --> 49:53.728
You're gonna find out
where we're all gonna be
when we wake up dead.

49:53.761 --> 49:57.097
Well, at least
us sinners anyway.

50:00.735 --> 50:02.069
Mm.

50:03.437 --> 50:04.739
It's so good.

50:35.202 --> 50:37.170
You seen Lucius?

50:37.204 --> 50:38.706
Jada, Lucius?

50:38.740 --> 50:40.140
Anybody seen Lucius?

50:40.173 --> 50:42.175
We open in ten minutes.

50:42.209 --> 50:45.078
- Hey, you seen Lucius?
- No. He ain't here yet?

50:45.112 --> 50:47.247
Well, no he ain't here yet.
And that ain't like him.

50:47.281 --> 50:49.483
- All right, well,
you try calling him?
- Yeah, I tried to call him,

50:49.517 --> 50:52.452
- but he didn't answer.
- Well, maybe he's
just running late.

50:52.486 --> 50:53.621
He'll probably be here soon.

50:53.655 --> 50:55.757
Yeah, well, he better.

51:04.599 --> 51:07.669
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

51:07.702 --> 51:09.069
Lucius?

51:13.641 --> 51:14.809
Hey...

51:14.842 --> 51:15.877
Let's get a move on.

51:15.910 --> 51:17.110
We gotta open.

51:17.144 --> 51:19.146
Uh, Dewey, uh,

51:19.179 --> 51:21.481
I'm not feeling so good.
I'm sorry. I gotta go home.

51:21.516 --> 51:23.450
Hey, you can't go.

51:23.483 --> 51:24.686
I already ain't got no cook!

51:24.719 --> 51:26.353
And Penny called,
said she's gonna be late.

51:26.386 --> 51:29.122
I'm sorry, I have to go.

51:29.156 --> 51:30.424
Delaine--

51:30.457 --> 51:32.760
You better be back
for the lunch shift.

51:42.570 --> 51:43.638
Lucius...

52:06.426 --> 52:08.295
Answer.

52:08.328 --> 52:10.632
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Russ.

52:10.665 --> 52:13.200
- <i>Hey there.</i>
- Hey, uh, hey, listen,

52:13.233 --> 52:14.669
I'm just-- I'm just calling
to let you know

52:14.702 --> 52:15.937
I'm going to stay at your house
again tonight,

52:15.970 --> 52:18.171
- if that's all right.
- <i>You know it is.</i>

52:18.205 --> 52:20.775
- <i>You okay?</i>
- No.

52:20.808 --> 52:21.943
<i>What's wrong?</i>

52:21.976 --> 52:23.544
I'll tell you

52:23.578 --> 52:26.781
when I get home from my shift,
okay, just please be there.

52:26.814 --> 52:27.915
<i>No problem.</i>

52:27.949 --> 52:29.784
Bye.

52:48.002 --> 52:49.637
Get out of my car.

52:49.671 --> 52:51.639
Who are you?

52:51.673 --> 52:53.775
Easy now, wildcat.

52:54.709 --> 52:56.276
We're friends of Lucius.

52:57.512 --> 52:59.580
Or rather we was.

52:59.614 --> 53:00.782
What do you mean?

53:00.815 --> 53:03.851
Seems our friend Lucius is dead,

53:03.885 --> 53:05.285
which is a shame.

53:05.318 --> 53:07.622
'Cause he owed me
a shit load of money.

53:08.990 --> 53:11.224
But silver lining,

53:11.258 --> 53:13.895
you just came into a shit load.

53:13.928 --> 53:17.632
So seeing as Lucius is dead
and you're the one
who killed him,

53:17.665 --> 53:19.534
his debt rolls over to you.

53:21.669 --> 53:24.404
I didn't kill Lucius.

53:24.438 --> 53:27.441
He's alive.
He just called me.

53:29.711 --> 53:30.878
Yeah, well, I doubt that,

53:30.912 --> 53:32.412
'cause we just seen him.

53:32.446 --> 53:35.248
He's dead as a doornail.

53:35.282 --> 53:37.284
- But--
- But, but, but, but, but...

53:37.317 --> 53:40.253
Save your buts, Princess.

53:40.287 --> 53:42.790
We saw you driving away.
How you think we found you?

53:44.324 --> 53:45.425
How much you gettin'?

53:49.831 --> 53:51.032
Fifty thousand.

53:51.065 --> 53:54.267
Fifty thousand dollars.

53:54.301 --> 53:56.771
Well, Lucius, he owed me ten.

53:56.804 --> 54:00.373
What, with interest and all,
carry the one divided by two...

54:00.407 --> 54:02.275
20k should do it.

54:03.010 --> 54:04.645
Twenty thousand?

54:04.679 --> 54:05.947
By tomorrow.

54:05.980 --> 54:08.549
That's impossible.

54:09.884 --> 54:13.921
See, Mace, the wicked
are stubborn and selfish.

54:14.589 --> 54:15.455
Do your thing.

54:16.356 --> 54:18.492
- No, no, no--
- Mace!

54:18.526 --> 54:20.528
What are you doing?

54:20.561 --> 54:23.396
She's a waitress, dummy.

54:23.430 --> 54:24.966
She's on her feet
all day long.

54:24.999 --> 54:27.034
You cut off her toe,
she's going be hobbling around

54:27.068 --> 54:28.770
like a three-legged dog.

54:31.706 --> 54:33.641
You right or left-handed?

54:33.674 --> 54:35.576
None of your damn business.

54:35.610 --> 54:39.412
Well, it's a known fact
that 90 percent of human beings

54:39.446 --> 54:41.682
are right-handed, so...

54:41.716 --> 54:43.951
No! No, no, no, no!

54:43.985 --> 54:44.819
Please, please, please.

54:44.852 --> 54:46.319
No, no, no!

54:46.353 --> 54:48.321
Please, please, stop--
I have the money.

54:48.355 --> 54:50.591
I'll get you the money.
Stop, please. Stop him!

54:50.625 --> 54:52.026
Okay, all right.

54:53.728 --> 54:57.064
I'm not a man completely
devoid of compassion.

54:57.098 --> 54:59.499
You can keep your finger.

54:59.534 --> 55:00.433
For now.

55:01.769 --> 55:03.771
But if I don't get my money
in two days,

55:03.805 --> 55:07.108
that little piggy right there,
it's gonna go "Wee, wee, wee,"

55:07.141 --> 55:09.076
all the way to the butcher shop.

55:14.015 --> 55:15.315
Time's up.

55:26.694 --> 55:27.628
This is Russ.

55:27.662 --> 55:29.664
What you doing for supper?

55:29.697 --> 55:31.098
I don't have any plans.

55:31.132 --> 55:33.067
Why don't you
come out to the house?

55:33.100 --> 55:35.102
I'll throw a couple of steaks
on the grill.

55:35.136 --> 55:37.605
Thurmond, is there something
you want to talk to me about?

55:37.638 --> 55:41.943
I got some information
you might be interested in.

55:41.976 --> 55:45.546
And I haven't been the kindest
person to you lately.

55:45.580 --> 55:46.714
Okay, what time?

55:46.747 --> 55:49.550
I eat early. Five?

55:49.584 --> 55:50.651
Okay.

55:51.752 --> 55:52.820
I'll be there.

56:02.897 --> 56:04.031
Come in.

56:05.800 --> 56:09.136
I just came by
to pick up a few things.

56:09.170 --> 56:11.806
Well, shit, come in and sit down
and we'll have a drink.

56:11.839 --> 56:13.875
Come on.

56:18.179 --> 56:20.948
How is, uh, Horace doing?

56:20.982 --> 56:23.551
- He is hanging in.
- Yeah?

56:23.584 --> 56:26.554
Just the medical bills
that are killing us.

56:26.587 --> 56:30.423
Well, I want to know that
I've been thinking about you.

56:30.457 --> 56:32.492
And I'm gonna come up
with something, okay.

56:32.526 --> 56:34.461
Oh, I appreciate that.

56:35.730 --> 56:36.864
Shit.

56:40.167 --> 56:41.168
Cheers.

56:43.738 --> 56:45.506
It was a damn good steak,
Thurmond.

56:48.042 --> 56:50.144
- Not much of a cook.
- Mm.

56:50.177 --> 56:52.780
But I can grill
with the best of 'em.

56:52.813 --> 56:54.548
So how long have you
been here now?

56:54.582 --> 56:57.118
Um, going on seven years.

56:57.151 --> 56:59.452
Oh.

56:59.486 --> 57:03.157
After my wife died,
I decided to build
my dream home.

57:03.190 --> 57:05.893
I don't know why the hell
I waited so long.

57:07.261 --> 57:08.663
What about you?

57:09.664 --> 57:10.932
How come you never married?

57:10.965 --> 57:12.700
Shit, I got close once.

57:12.733 --> 57:13.801
What about Delaine?

57:13.834 --> 57:15.903
I mean, she's fine.
We're friends.

57:15.937 --> 57:19.472
And you're telling me
that you two never...

57:19.507 --> 57:21.776
I mean,
being neighbors and all.

57:21.809 --> 57:22.877
We're not that neighborly.

57:22.910 --> 57:24.845
Okay, okay.

57:24.879 --> 57:26.814
Excuse me for prying.

57:26.847 --> 57:29.951
Just habit of the job.

57:29.984 --> 57:33.054
So what's the, uh, information
you wanted to talk to me about?

57:33.087 --> 57:34.055
Oh, yeah.

57:36.223 --> 57:37.658
Take a look at this.

57:42.897 --> 57:44.732
Lucius McFalls.

57:44.765 --> 57:45.866
Bad dude.

57:46.834 --> 57:47.802
You know that guy?

57:49.103 --> 57:50.571
No, I don't know him,

57:50.604 --> 57:51.706
but I saw him the other day.

57:52.773 --> 57:53.808
Where?

57:53.841 --> 57:55.543
Over at Delaine's house,

57:55.576 --> 57:58.145
he was helping her
move her Daddy's shit out.

57:58.179 --> 58:00.548
I mean, he's got
a hell of a rap sheet.

58:00.581 --> 58:02.482
- Well--
- Petty stuff, but...

58:03.718 --> 58:05.820
still, it's just
not the kind of person

58:05.853 --> 58:07.989
I would think Delaine
would be hanging around.

58:08.022 --> 58:09.857
Well, obviously, I'll tell her.

58:09.890 --> 58:13.094
No, don't... tell her about it.

58:13.127 --> 58:13.995
Why not?

58:15.730 --> 58:17.497
Well, I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

58:19.033 --> 58:21.669
What the hell, I think
you have a right to know.

58:23.771 --> 58:25.206
You're being used.

58:26.774 --> 58:29.844
Whenever there's a murder,
we ask,

58:29.877 --> 58:31.812
"Who stands to gain from it?"

58:31.846 --> 58:34.815
Who stands to gain
from Carl's death?

58:36.217 --> 58:37.918
I don't know.

58:37.952 --> 58:39.854
Delaine, of course.

58:41.122 --> 58:42.156
Why?

58:42.189 --> 58:43.858
Life insurance.

58:45.693 --> 58:50.197
Delaine stands to get
over $500,000.

58:52.767 --> 58:55.336
So... I don't--
I'm not following.

58:55.369 --> 58:56.871
What are you saying, Thurmond?

58:58.272 --> 59:00.641
I'm saying I believe

59:00.674 --> 59:04.245
that Delaine and hired Lucius
to kill Carl,

59:04.278 --> 59:07.048
make it look like you were
the original target.

59:07.081 --> 59:10.117
The old wrong house,
wrong victim thing.

59:10.151 --> 59:12.286
Yeah, that's-that's crazy.

59:12.319 --> 59:13.654
I'm the one that brought it up.

59:14.822 --> 59:17.291
Played right into their hands.

59:17.324 --> 59:19.693
I bet Lucius
is the one calling you.

59:21.629 --> 59:22.329
Hm.

59:24.131 --> 59:28.636
Lucius was seen
driving on your street at 10:13.

59:29.970 --> 59:31.305
It puts him right there.

59:31.338 --> 59:32.973
Some shit.

59:33.007 --> 59:35.810
To top it off,

59:35.843 --> 59:38.345
Delaine and Carl
are in a shit load of debt.

59:39.413 --> 59:41.082
Online betting.

59:42.349 --> 59:45.086
They were about to
lose the house.

59:45.119 --> 59:48.289
So she's been
borrowing money from Dewey

59:48.322 --> 59:51.225
and then working extra shifts
to pay him off.

59:51.258 --> 59:53.761
Thurmond, who else
knows about this?

59:53.794 --> 59:55.262
Nobody.

59:55.296 --> 59:58.199
Like I told you,
I shouldn't be telling you.

59:58.232 --> 1:00:01.735
But I wanted to confirm
a couple of things.

1:00:01.769 --> 1:00:05.940
And I... I think you
have a right to know.

1:00:05.973 --> 1:00:07.308
Well, I appreciate it.

1:00:07.341 --> 1:00:09.076
I really do.
Thank you.

1:00:09.110 --> 1:00:12.113
Now, not a word to Delaine.
Okay?

1:00:12.146 --> 1:00:14.882
Not a word.
I promise.

1:01:49.476 --> 1:01:51.011
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1:01:53.314 --> 1:01:55.883
You okay?

1:01:57.017 --> 1:01:58.385
Yeah, I'm just glad you're home.

1:02:03.824 --> 1:02:05.025
I'm here now.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:07.228
What's going on?

1:02:09.496 --> 1:02:13.867
Russ, I can't thank you enough
for how you've taken care of me
since Daddy died.

1:02:13.901 --> 1:02:15.336
Well, listen,
I'm happy to help.

1:02:17.171 --> 1:02:18.739
I would've done
anything for you.

1:02:20.207 --> 1:02:22.910
Okay, Russ, there's something
I gotta tell you.

1:02:23.944 --> 1:02:25.012
Okay, I'm listening.

1:02:26.947 --> 1:02:30.851
I just... I don't know
how you're going to take this.

1:02:32.386 --> 1:02:35.523
I think I could
use a beer first.

1:02:35.557 --> 1:02:38.125
Cool, you know where
the fridge is, right?

1:02:38.158 --> 1:02:40.361
- Grab me one, too,
while you're at it.
- Okay.

1:03:36.984 --> 1:03:38.018
You get lost?

1:03:44.124 --> 1:03:47.161
So, there's something
you wanted to tell me.

1:03:48.663 --> 1:03:50.331
Tell me about your day first.

1:03:51.298 --> 1:03:52.199
I mean, it was good.

1:03:52.232 --> 1:03:54.368
I went over to Thurmond's,
we had steaks,

1:03:54.401 --> 1:03:57.639
and he updated me
about the investigation, so...

1:03:57.672 --> 1:04:01.408
You? I'm the one
he should be updating.

1:04:01.442 --> 1:04:03.578
Well, I think he was
gonna fill you in tomorrow,

1:04:03.611 --> 1:04:06.947
but, uh, he won't be
doing that anymore.

1:04:06.980 --> 1:04:08.415
Why not?

1:04:09.517 --> 1:04:11.051
Well, I shot him.

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:14.488
What?

1:04:14.522 --> 1:04:16.957
Yeah, he's dead, Delaine.
I shot him.

1:04:17.991 --> 1:04:19.026
Why?

1:04:19.059 --> 1:04:20.562
Old Thurmond
was a little smarter

1:04:20.595 --> 1:04:22.162
than I gave him credit for.

1:04:22.196 --> 1:04:24.365
He knew everything, Delaine.

1:04:24.398 --> 1:04:27.267
Well, not everything.
I, mean he didn't know that I...

1:04:27.301 --> 1:04:29.203
I knew everything, too.

1:04:29.236 --> 1:04:30.904
I owe people money.

1:04:30.938 --> 1:04:32.574
And they won't wait,
so I can't wait.

1:04:32.607 --> 1:04:34.642
Look, the insurance company
will pay out

1:04:34.676 --> 1:04:37.277
as soon as the sheriff
wraps up his investigation.

1:04:37.311 --> 1:04:39.146
The money'll be here any day.

1:04:41.616 --> 1:04:43.317
Yeah.

1:04:43.350 --> 1:04:44.952
Aren't I the fool?

1:04:46.521 --> 1:04:50.224
And to think that I suggested
the wrong house,

1:04:50.257 --> 1:04:52.359
the wrong victim theory
to Thurmond.

1:04:54.094 --> 1:04:55.295
You don't know
the whole story.

1:04:56.430 --> 1:04:57.398
Oh, yeah?

1:04:58.432 --> 1:05:00.167
What don't I know, Delaine?

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:01.168
Tell me.

1:05:01.201 --> 1:05:02.236
First, why don't you tell me

1:05:02.269 --> 1:05:04.438
what Lucius
is doing in your trunk?

1:05:04.471 --> 1:05:06.273
Well, he's protecting us.

1:05:07.207 --> 1:05:08.610
No body, no crime.

1:05:09.611 --> 1:05:11.646
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

1:05:13.013 --> 1:05:15.449
You see, you and I,

1:05:15.482 --> 1:05:18.318
we're going to split
the insurance money.

1:05:18.352 --> 1:05:21.155
What people don't understand
is I lost a lot of money

1:05:21.188 --> 1:05:22.724
when the merger
didn't go through.

1:05:22.757 --> 1:05:24.958
I'm about to
lose my business.

1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:27.094
I don't understand.

1:05:27.127 --> 1:05:29.329
I was with you

1:05:29.363 --> 1:05:31.699
when I got one of them calls
from Lucius.

1:05:31.733 --> 1:05:35.068
- Yeah.
- How do you explain that?

1:05:35.102 --> 1:05:36.036
Pernie.

1:05:37.104 --> 1:05:39.173
Yeah. I gave her the recording.

1:05:40.508 --> 1:05:44.077
And you did exactly
what I thought you would do.

1:05:44.111 --> 1:05:46.681
You see, Pernie,
she's broke, too.

1:05:46.714 --> 1:05:48.583
So when I told her
about my little plan,

1:05:48.616 --> 1:05:50.752
she, you know,
was eager to help out

1:05:50.785 --> 1:05:54.221
for a...
a small cut, of course.

1:05:56.223 --> 1:05:58.158
Lord have mercy.

1:05:58.192 --> 1:06:00.327
So, Delaine,

1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:02.630
once again, what don't I know?

1:06:05.633 --> 1:06:07.401
This wasn't my idea.

1:06:09.136 --> 1:06:13.373
It was Daddy's, his-his cancer
came back stage four.

1:06:13.407 --> 1:06:15.375
So that's why you killed him?

1:06:16.544 --> 1:06:18.111
He was gonna commit suicide,

1:06:18.145 --> 1:06:20.782
but then I wouldn't get
any insurance money.

1:06:20.815 --> 1:06:23.250
We're in debt
from his gambling habit.

1:06:23.283 --> 1:06:25.018
About to lose the house.

1:06:28.188 --> 1:06:33.695
Russ... I didn't know you then
like I know you now.

1:06:33.728 --> 1:06:36.296
If I did, I never would've
gone through with this.

1:06:37.632 --> 1:06:40.668
I never meant you no harm.

1:06:40.702 --> 1:06:43.403
Do you expect me
to believe that shit?

1:06:45.305 --> 1:06:47.307
It's the God to honest truth.

1:06:48.308 --> 1:06:50.077
Delaine, you killed your--

1:06:53.313 --> 1:06:55.182
We could have made
a go of this.

1:06:55.215 --> 1:06:58.218
I was falling in love
with you, Russ.

1:06:58.252 --> 1:07:00.722
I really was.

1:07:00.755 --> 1:07:02.790
If you woulda only
minded your own business.

1:07:03.858 --> 1:07:06.260
But money is money.

1:07:06.293 --> 1:07:09.329
And if you interfere again,
I will kill you.

1:07:11.098 --> 1:07:13.133
I'm leaving now.

1:10:22.355 --> 1:10:24.257
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1:10:24.291 --> 1:10:26.527
Hey, shh.

1:10:26.561 --> 1:10:28.930
Listen, everything's gonna be
okay, all right.

1:10:28.963 --> 1:10:30.397
We'll just split the money.
Okay?

1:11:55.616 --> 1:11:57.752
I'm sorry, I can't lie.

1:12:17.470 --> 1:12:18.940
<i>Try as you might,</i>

1:12:18.973 --> 1:12:22.143
<i>you can't escape His</i>
<i>all-seeing gaze.</i>

1:12:22.176 --> 1:12:25.546
<i>Do you think He who</i>
<i>made the eye, doesn't see?</i>

1:12:25.580 --> 1:12:28.749
<i>Do you think He who</i>
<i>made the ear, doesn't hear?</i>

1:12:28.783 --> 1:12:32.153
<i>Do you think He who</i>
<i>judges the nations,</i>
<i>doesn't punish?</i>

1:12:32.186 --> 1:12:35.422
<i>He knows all</i>
<i>and will reward the righteous</i>

1:12:35.455 --> 1:12:37.959
<i>according to</i>
<i>their good deeds.</i>

1:12:37.992 --> 1:12:41.829
<i>But the wicked, oh, the wicked.</i>

1:12:41.863 --> 1:12:44.098
<i>He will punish</i>
<i>in eternal hellfire</i>

1:12:44.131 --> 1:12:46.534
<i>that was created for</i>
<i>the devil and his angels.</i>

1:12:46.567 --> 1:12:50.972
<i>So, beware my friends,</i>
<i>your sins will find you out.</i>

1:12:51.005 --> 1:12:55.176
<i>Maybe not today,</i>
<i>maybe not tomorrow, but soon.</i>

1:12:55.209 --> 1:12:57.144
Oh, shut the hell up.

1:13:16.597 --> 1:13:17.999
Hard to believe, ain't it?

1:13:18.032 --> 1:13:18.933
Surely is.

1:13:18.966 --> 1:13:20.902
Sheriff filed a murder

1:13:20.935 --> 1:13:23.170
and another body
dragged from the reservoir.

1:13:23.204 --> 1:13:25.206
Sure is some meanness
in this world.

1:13:25.239 --> 1:13:26.707
Amen to that.

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:35.016
Tillman, what'll you have?

1:13:35.049 --> 1:13:36.617
You got a minute?

1:13:36.651 --> 1:13:37.818
Just about.

1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:42.489
That is one heck of a shiner
you got on your head.

1:13:44.725 --> 1:13:46.994
You know the last time there was
a murder in this county?

1:13:48.896 --> 1:13:52.099
- Nearly 30 years ago.
- Okay.

1:13:52.133 --> 1:13:56.537
Okay, so now there's been
three murders in just a few
days.

1:14:00.675 --> 1:14:02.510
Hold on. Gotta take this.

1:14:04.111 --> 1:14:05.146
Yeah?

1:14:08.249 --> 1:14:09.617
Is that right?

1:14:10.885 --> 1:14:12.720
When was this?

1:14:12.753 --> 1:14:14.487
I'll be there directly.

1:14:17.658 --> 1:14:20.528
Make that four murders.

1:14:20.561 --> 1:14:23.097
Russ Potter's body
was just found in the reservoir.

1:14:23.130 --> 1:14:25.465
Not far from Lucius McFalls.

1:14:26.300 --> 1:14:27.902
No, that's not--

1:14:27.935 --> 1:14:28.903
That's not possible.

1:14:28.936 --> 1:14:30.638
I just saw him the other night.

1:14:30.671 --> 1:14:32.740
You know what all four
have in common?

1:14:34.041 --> 1:14:35.076
You.

1:14:36.310 --> 1:14:37.611
What are you saying?

1:14:37.645 --> 1:14:39.947
Oh, see, there's your daddy.

1:14:39.981 --> 1:14:42.016
Russ Potter
was-was your neighbor.

1:14:42.049 --> 1:14:44.018
You worked with Lucius McFalls.

1:14:45.119 --> 1:14:46.654
And Sheriff Fowler,

1:14:46.687 --> 1:14:49.056
he was investigating
your daddy's killing

1:14:49.090 --> 1:14:52.626
at the same time
as his murder.

1:14:53.627 --> 1:14:55.262
Don't that strike you odd?

1:14:56.831 --> 1:14:59.233
Kane, your mind is perverted.

1:14:59.266 --> 1:15:04.271
I'm not gonna sit here
and take the slanderous attacks
on my character.

1:15:04.305 --> 1:15:06.107
If you'll excuse me,

1:15:06.140 --> 1:15:09.643
Miss Betty over at table seven
needs her check.

1:15:09.677 --> 1:15:11.278
Hey, hey, just one more thing.

1:15:12.980 --> 1:15:15.750
Now, how come you drove
Russ Potter's car

1:15:15.783 --> 1:15:16.951
to work this morning?

1:15:16.984 --> 1:15:18.753
He let me borrow it.

1:15:18.786 --> 1:15:19.887
And where's your car?

1:15:21.789 --> 1:15:22.990
It got stolen.

1:15:23.024 --> 1:15:24.625
Did you report it missing?

1:15:24.658 --> 1:15:26.260
I'm reporting it now.

1:15:27.661 --> 1:15:28.929
Excuse me.

1:15:32.666 --> 1:15:35.603
Miss Betty.
Here you go.

1:15:35.636 --> 1:15:37.271
- Delaine!
- Comin'.

1:15:37.304 --> 1:15:38.873
It's for you.

1:15:38.906 --> 1:15:40.708
Now, you know I don't
like personal calls.

1:15:40.741 --> 1:15:42.777
Make it quick, please.

1:15:45.212 --> 1:15:45.913
Hello?

1:15:45.946 --> 1:15:47.181
<i>Where will you be</i>

1:15:47.214 --> 1:15:49.683
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

1:15:49.717 --> 1:15:52.920
- Who is this?
<i>- Oh, who do you think?</i>

1:15:52.953 --> 1:15:57.058
- What do you want?
- You're a bright girl,
figure it out.

1:15:57.091 --> 1:16:01.095
<i>-</i> How much?
<i>- Well, half sounds good.</i>

1:16:01.128 --> 1:16:03.030
I wasn't gonna be so greedy,

1:16:03.064 --> 1:16:04.932
<i>but since you put me</i>
<i>out of work</i>

1:16:04.965 --> 1:16:08.669
<i>and jobs for women my age</i>
<i>aren't all that plentiful,</i>

1:16:08.702 --> 1:16:11.038
<i>I think I deserve to be greedy.</i>

1:16:11.072 --> 1:16:12.640
Yeah, well,
I ain't got the money yet.

1:16:12.673 --> 1:16:14.842
Oh, I know that.

1:16:14.875 --> 1:16:18.012
But when you do,
don't forget about old Pernie.

1:16:18.045 --> 1:16:20.881
Old Pernie knows everything.

1:16:20.915 --> 1:16:23.918
<i>And don't think you</i>
<i>can get rid of me</i>
<i>like you did the others.</i>

1:16:23.951 --> 1:16:27.088
The minute you
step foot on my property,

1:16:27.121 --> 1:16:30.191
you'll be dead before
the other foot hits the ground.

1:16:30.224 --> 1:16:32.760
And turn your cell phone on.

1:16:32.793 --> 1:16:35.162
Pernie don't like being ignored.

1:16:49.977 --> 1:16:51.178
You sure work a lot.

1:16:51.212 --> 1:16:53.280
Yeah, well,
I got bills to pay.

1:16:53.314 --> 1:16:56.250
Well, I would pray that
I'm on the top of that list,

1:16:57.151 --> 1:16:58.652
We got a problem.

1:17:00.354 --> 1:17:02.756
We got a problem, huh?
What is our problem?

1:17:02.790 --> 1:17:03.757
Pernie.

1:17:04.458 --> 1:17:05.693
What's a Pernie?

1:17:05.726 --> 1:17:07.962
Oh, Pernie's not a what,
she's a who.

1:17:07.995 --> 1:17:09.964
And so why is she our problem?

1:17:09.997 --> 1:17:14.068
Because she knows everything.
And she wants a big cut,

1:17:14.101 --> 1:17:16.237
and if she don't get it,
she's gonna go to the police.

1:17:16.270 --> 1:17:21.909
And if she does, I go to jail,
which means no insurance money.

1:17:21.942 --> 1:17:23.911
Well, I still don't see
how she's our problem.

1:17:23.944 --> 1:17:24.845
She's your problem.

1:17:24.879 --> 1:17:26.881
She wants a cut,
give her a cut of your cut.

1:17:26.914 --> 1:17:28.816
Nice upgrade, by the way.

1:17:28.849 --> 1:17:32.453
When I say she wants a cut,
she wants all of it.

1:17:32.486 --> 1:17:33.988
She's blackmailing me.

1:17:37.424 --> 1:17:39.059
What'd you have in mind?

1:19:01.075 --> 1:19:02.476
Ain't nobody here.

1:19:02.510 --> 1:19:04.378
Maybe we got the wrong house.

1:19:04.411 --> 1:19:06.981
No, we got the right house.

1:19:07.014 --> 1:19:09.083
This is the address
Delaine gave me.

1:19:10.117 --> 1:19:11.919
Maybe they're out for supper.

1:19:11.952 --> 1:19:13.187
At midnight?

1:19:13.220 --> 1:19:15.089
Use your goddamn brain.

1:19:16.957 --> 1:19:18.158
Something ain't right.

1:19:29.103 --> 1:19:31.338
What... the...?

1:19:31.372 --> 1:19:33.240
You remember to get gas?

1:19:33.274 --> 1:19:35.476
- Well, yeah.
- Well, then why
ain't she starting?

1:19:35.510 --> 1:19:37.311
Uh, I don't know.

1:19:38.345 --> 1:19:39.413
Go check under the hood.

1:19:39.446 --> 1:19:40.881
What for?

1:19:40.914 --> 1:19:44.251
'Cause that's where
the engine is, dumbass.

1:20:00.602 --> 1:20:02.803
Battery ain't connected.

1:20:17.084 --> 1:20:18.152
Get out of the car!

1:20:18.185 --> 1:20:19.286
Hey, you.

1:20:30.331 --> 1:20:32.333
Nice work.

1:20:32.366 --> 1:20:34.569
Cancer ain't got me yet.

1:20:34.602 --> 1:20:37.237
Yeah.

1:20:37.271 --> 1:20:39.206
- <i>It's done.</i>
- Are you sure?

1:20:39.239 --> 1:20:43.944
I said it's done.
And thanks for the tip.

1:20:43.977 --> 1:20:47.348
Even if it was you
who sent 'em my way
in the first place.

1:20:47.381 --> 1:20:49.651
And how do I know it's done?

1:20:49.684 --> 1:20:54.188
Oh, trust me.
Those boys won't be
seeing their mamas no more.

1:20:55.557 --> 1:20:59.226
Now, it's just the two of us.

1:20:59.259 --> 1:21:02.329
<i>You be sure to let me know</i>
<i>when that check comes in.</i>

1:21:02.363 --> 1:21:06.100
Remember,
old Pernie knows everything.

1:21:06.133 --> 1:21:08.135
So you keep sayin'.

1:21:08.168 --> 1:21:11.238
Just don't want you to forget.

1:21:11.271 --> 1:21:13.941
I gotta go.
Customers are waiting.

1:22:01.989 --> 1:22:03.323
What the devil?

1:22:06.293 --> 1:22:11.165
Oh, girl,
you should know better
than to mess with old Pernie!

1:22:15.502 --> 1:22:17.004
Whoo.

1:22:20.207 --> 1:22:22.176
How do you like that,
you old bitch?

1:23:04.051 --> 1:23:06.487
<i>We got a 10-50</i>
<i>on Davis Crossing Road</i>

1:23:06.521 --> 1:23:08.355
<i>at the entrance of...</i>

1:23:08.388 --> 1:23:10.491
<i>Got a 10-79 female.</i>

1:23:10.525 --> 1:23:12.192
Ten-four, en route.

1:23:31.679 --> 1:23:33.146
What's going on?

1:23:41.823 --> 1:23:43.423
Ah, shit.

1:23:50.632 --> 1:23:51.766
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:23:51.799 --> 1:23:53.400
Dewey, Dew--

1:23:53.433 --> 1:23:55.402
Dewey, I'll be there
in a few minutes.

1:23:55.435 --> 1:23:56.704
Well, you just
need to get here.

1:23:56.738 --> 1:23:58.305
Okay, the lunch rush
don't even start

1:23:58.338 --> 1:23:59.807
for another good half hour,
okay.

1:23:59.841 --> 1:24:01.709
And I'm gonna need you
to work double shift, too.

1:24:01.743 --> 1:24:04.579
Okay. Yes, I will work
the supper shift, too.

1:24:04.612 --> 1:24:06.514
Okay. Bye.

1:24:07.682 --> 1:24:09.216
Bleeding Christ.

1:24:21.395 --> 1:24:22.830
Delaine.

1:24:22.864 --> 1:24:25.800
- Tillman.
- We have a warrant
for your arrest.

1:24:25.833 --> 1:24:29.704
Arrest?
What charge?

1:24:29.737 --> 1:24:31.806
You're under arrest for
the murders of Carl Moore,

1:24:31.839 --> 1:24:35.142
Russ Potter, Lucius McFalls,
and Pernie Cannon.

1:24:35.175 --> 1:24:37.277
Now, you have the right
to remain silent.

1:24:37.311 --> 1:24:41.415
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in the court of law.

1:24:41.448 --> 1:24:42.750
You have the right to attorney.

1:24:42.784 --> 1:24:44.151
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

1:24:44.184 --> 1:24:46.654
one will be appointed to you.

1:24:46.688 --> 1:24:48.756
Do you understand
these rights I've said to you?

1:24:49.657 --> 1:24:50.825
Sure.

1:24:57.832 --> 1:24:59.132
Thank you.

1:25:04.806 --> 1:25:06.139
Mm.

1:25:07.374 --> 1:25:09.209
Y'all don't understand.

1:25:09.242 --> 1:25:11.378
Understand what?

1:25:11.411 --> 1:25:13.681
Well, I was only doing
what come natural.

1:25:15.182 --> 1:25:16.684
Ain't greed natural?

1:25:17.785 --> 1:25:20.855
How can you or God blame me?

1:25:20.888 --> 1:25:22.590
You broke the law.

1:25:22.624 --> 1:25:24.626
The law.

1:25:24.659 --> 1:25:28.796
Oh, okay. So I'm a sinner
because I broke the law?

1:25:28.830 --> 1:25:33.668
Mm. Or did I break the law

1:25:33.701 --> 1:25:36.169
because I'm a sinner?

1:25:36.203 --> 1:25:37.672
What does it matter?

1:25:39.439 --> 1:25:43.911
Well, it matters
'cause if I knew the answer,

1:25:43.945 --> 1:25:46.614
I'd be free.

1:25:46.648 --> 1:25:49.416
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
about any of that, but...

1:25:50.818 --> 1:25:52.854
I suggest you stop talking.

1:25:58.559 --> 1:26:00.528
All right. Let's go.

1:26:12.674 --> 1:26:15.342
<i>It's a funny question to ask.</i>

1:26:15.375 --> 1:26:17.477
<i>"Where are you after you die?"</i>

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:22.449
<i>For me, it's not</i>
<i>an altogether unpleasant place,</i>

1:26:22.482 --> 1:26:24.819
<i>but I can't speak for</i>
<i>other souls.</i>

1:26:24.852 --> 1:26:28.990
<i>And I do sense that if</i>
<i>the totality of your actions</i>

1:26:29.023 --> 1:26:30.992
<i>are more good than bad,</i>

1:26:31.025 --> 1:26:34.729
<i>you end up on the right side</i>
<i>of your maker.</i>

1:26:34.762 --> 1:26:38.633
<i>For those who tip the scales</i>
<i>the other way,</i>

1:26:38.666 --> 1:26:43.004
<i>well,</i>
<i>as the radio preacher says,</i>

1:26:43.037 --> 1:26:45.807
<i>"Hell is hell."</i>
