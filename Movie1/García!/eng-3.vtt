WEBVTT

00:58.640 --> 01:00.560
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.280
You're welcome.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.359
You're an idiot.

01:10.359 --> 01:13.319
I told you.
I arrive late, but I do arrive.

01:16.359 --> 01:19.480
- Can you charge me?
- It's not necessary.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.519
- Are you still mad at me?
- No. But we have to talk.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.680
Wait a second.
If you'll allow me...

01:49.920 --> 01:52.480
Listen,
I've always told you everything.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.200
About my father during the war,
about the fevers,

01:55.200 --> 01:57.599
about my boyfriend in the village, Manolín,

01:57.599 --> 02:00.200
who never even gave me a kiss.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.480
But so that you'd know.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.120
You don't tell me anything.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.159
I don't know where you come from,
if you've got family.

02:07.159 --> 02:08.840
My cousin says I'm a fool,

02:08.840 --> 02:12.360
that you're probably married
and have four kids in Segovia.

02:15.919 --> 02:18.680
I'm not married,
and I don't have children.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.479
In Segovia I've never been,

02:20.479 --> 02:23.159
but I'll invite you
to some suckling pig.

02:23.159 --> 02:26.599
- You and your cousin.
- I don't think this is funny!

02:28.080 --> 02:31.199
I'm sorry. You're right.
Ask me whatever you want.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.319
Well... I don't know anything.

02:37.319 --> 02:39.719
Where are you from?
Where's your family?

02:53.159 --> 02:56.080
When the war broke out,
I enlisted in the regiment...

02:56.080 --> 02:59.280
Oh, don't talk to me about the war,
we've had enough of that.

03:00.719 --> 03:02.520
Tell me about your work instead.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.919
You don't want to tell me.

03:06.919 --> 03:09.039
- Why? Is it something bad?
- No.

03:11.199 --> 03:13.840
I work for the government, but...

03:13.840 --> 03:16.879
It's complicated.
They don't let me talk about it.

03:16.879 --> 03:20.000
You'll have to figure something out,
I can't marry a man

03:20.000 --> 03:22.159
and not know where he goes,
when he...

03:22.159 --> 03:23.560
That's why I'll quit.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.199
I'm tired of secrets.

03:30.520 --> 03:35.240
- You said "marry."
- Well, yes... of course.

03:35.240 --> 03:40.240
I want that too, Feli.
A regular life. With you.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.800
- Children, perhaps.
- But not four, eh?

03:45.919 --> 03:47.360
As many as you want.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.800
I still have to do one last job.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.280
When I finish, I promise

03:53.280 --> 03:55.520
I'll come back
and tell you everything.

04:55.199 --> 04:58.279
It's the train that does the route
to the Pyrenees.

04:58.279 --> 05:01.319
We could attack it here,
here and here.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.199
Here, we'd have good access...

05:06.120 --> 05:10.680
Better here. I know the area.
It is in the middle of the mountains,

05:10.680 --> 05:12.759
there are no villages,
nor shepherds.

05:12.759 --> 05:14.519
No witnesses.

05:14.519 --> 05:17.600
I don't think Neffenberg
will surrender without a battle.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
I don't want civil casualties.

05:21.199 --> 05:24.319
We'll communicate
as soon as we capture Neffenberg.

05:24.319 --> 05:25.800
That's all.

05:36.759 --> 05:38.800
We'll be waiting for your report.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.920
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

05:42.959 --> 05:44.959
- Gentlemen.
- God be with you.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.040
Well, well, well.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.000
- It went well, right?
- It wasn't bad.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.360
It wasn't bad? It was amazing!

06:00.720 --> 06:04.800
They were all listening to me.
They congratulated me.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.720
- Me!
- You did it well, yeah.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.240
Although, in the future,

06:10.240 --> 06:13.279
you'll have to do it like this
many times.

06:13.279 --> 06:14.920
I've got something for you.

06:23.319 --> 06:24.680
It isn't my birthday.

06:26.279 --> 06:29.800
They're so that you remember me.
This will be my last mission.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.680
When we catch Neffenberg,
I'll retire.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.800
- But Section Nine...
- It can carry on without me.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.439
But we... You and I, I mean.

06:39.439 --> 06:41.959
García and Ortiz, always together...

06:41.959 --> 06:44.879
We have done good work together
all these years.

06:44.879 --> 06:49.040
- No one could have asked more of us.
- But why? Why now?

06:49.040 --> 06:52.399
I've brought you a man's present.
Be a man.

06:52.399 --> 06:56.079
- Ain't I?
- No. You're a boy playing soldiers.

06:56.079 --> 06:57.879
This isn't a game.

06:57.879 --> 07:00.519
Soldiers don't fight
because they like war.

07:00.519 --> 07:02.319
They fight so that war will end,

07:03.639 --> 07:08.000
so they can go back to their homes,
love a woman...

07:10.480 --> 07:12.279
have a family.

07:16.879 --> 07:19.199
They fight for what
we should all fight for.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.399
I don't believe it...
I just don't believe it.

08:50.399 --> 08:54.559
Me neither. You're alive
and exactly the same as 60 years ago.

08:54.559 --> 08:56.679
How is it possible? It's a miracle.

08:56.679 --> 09:00.600
- We have a lot to talk about.
- Yes, a lot. I've got questions.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.919
Look, Dad,
this is really something...

09:02.919 --> 09:06.360
Are you seriously telling me
you are the head of Section Nine?

09:06.360 --> 09:08.480
Unbelievable,
I'm finding out now.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.879
- What are you? Spies? Army?
- Antonia...

09:10.879 --> 09:13.639
What about those Black Ops?
Are they spies too?

09:13.639 --> 09:17.879
Or do they work for another country?
Why were they following me?

09:17.879 --> 09:21.000
What about that envelope
I received with his photo?

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
- Benito, take her home.
- What? No, no.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.159
I'm not going anywhere.
Especially, not with this man.

09:28.159 --> 09:30.200
- We'll talk later.
- No, I won't.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.799
- Antonia...
- Let go of me!

09:31.799 --> 09:33.519
- Leave me alone!
- Get out!

09:33.519 --> 09:36.919
You have a tracking program installed
on your computer.

09:36.919 --> 09:39.320
That's how the Black Ops found you.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.159
- Delete it.
- What?

09:43.159 --> 09:45.919
- Delete it, I said!
- No, wait! No, no!

09:48.799 --> 09:50.480
Shit!

09:57.799 --> 10:01.240
She's a good girl.
Stubborn as a mule, but a good girl.

10:01.240 --> 10:05.559
Yes. Just like you
when you were her age.

10:07.320 --> 10:12.000
So... you took my advice.
You have a daughter.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.879
- Did you get married?
- The happiest years of my life.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.360
Today, Section Nine...
Well, you've seen it.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.200
Friends are dying...

10:24.200 --> 10:25.919
Antonia is all I have left.

10:25.919 --> 10:28.120
She was there
when I woke up.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.080
She found me in a crypt.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.240
Inside a kind of glass coffin.
Something very complex.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.320
- A crypt?
- It collapsed.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.679
Some men tried to kill us
and one of them blew the place up.

10:40.679 --> 10:43.600
It was like a lab filled
with strange machines...

10:43.600 --> 10:47.080
I guess they were keeping me alive.
Or frozen in time.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.399
- What's the last thing you remember?
- The mission.

10:50.399 --> 10:53.519
Neffenberg was threatening you.
I surrendered. And then...

10:56.600 --> 10:58.000
Just cold.

10:59.279 --> 11:00.519
Darkness.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.279
Neffenberg shot you.

11:06.279 --> 11:09.480
He hit me and knocked me unconscious.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.159
When I opened my eyes, I was alone.

11:12.159 --> 11:16.279
I went back to the base.
I couldn't believe you were dead.

11:16.279 --> 11:19.360
We searched for you, Mr. García,
for years.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.440
- And in the end, I thought that...
- It's okay.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.799
Don't worry.

11:28.840 --> 11:32.639
In 1964, Neffenberg was identified
as one of the victims

11:32.639 --> 11:34.440
of a plane crash in Rome.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.240
Winters is alive.
How is that possible?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.960
I saw him fall...

11:38.960 --> 11:41.919
If he survived, 60 years passed,
he should be old.

11:41.919 --> 11:44.279
His father tried
to make him immortal.

11:44.279 --> 11:47.720
He may not have been able,
but I think he came very close.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.519
Winters survived the fall
from the train and worse.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.559
We know that he escaped from Spain
and went to Haiti.

11:55.559 --> 11:58.519
In the 70s, we found him in Chile,

11:58.519 --> 12:01.120
We lost track of him
in the war in Rwanda,

12:01.120 --> 12:04.039
but he showed up
a few years ago, in Ukraine...

12:04.039 --> 12:06.799
Why hasn't someone caught
this murderer?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.600
They dismantled Section Nine.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.240
They gave me a position as a janitor
at the ministry,

12:14.240 --> 12:16.399
for the services provided...

12:16.399 --> 12:21.080
I saved everything I could,
but I'm the only one left.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.519
And Benito, who's a retired soldier

12:23.519 --> 12:26.279
and worked with me
in the last years of Ninth.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.960
- The locksmith's shop is his.
- I see.

12:31.559 --> 12:35.360
I went to the old HQ.
I think it's a clothing store now.

12:36.679 --> 12:39.799
Things have changed a lot
in this country.

12:39.799 --> 12:42.480
This isn't the Spain we fought for...

12:42.480 --> 12:44.279
I also went to Feli's hair salon.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.480
There was nobody there.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.159
It's been more than 60 years.
I don't know if...

12:52.159 --> 12:55.120
If she's alive, we'll find her.
I promise.

12:59.120 --> 13:03.200
...and it turns out that the head
of this whole thing is my father.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.480
Just so I get this clear.
Your father is a spy?

13:06.480 --> 13:08.519
Well, he's almost 80 years old.

13:08.519 --> 13:11.240
He's not jumping out
of helicopters or that.

13:11.240 --> 13:15.039
But he is the head
of a secret agency.

13:16.799 --> 13:20.480
We have to find out everything
about Section Nine.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.000
But didn't your father tell you
to stay out of it?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.440
Well, yeah, but we'll investigate
and publish this.

13:28.639 --> 13:31.440
If he thinks he can kick me out
and hide things

13:31.440 --> 13:34.960
and that I'm going to stay quiet,
he's wrong.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.120
I'm going back to that locksmith
to ask García to tell me everything.

13:40.879 --> 13:45.080
You might be able
to help us again, Agent Garcia.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.279
This woman was kidnapped.

13:47.279 --> 13:49.879
Catalina Bellido,
presidential candidate

13:49.879 --> 13:51.600
in the upcoming elections.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.720
A woman? Elections?

13:54.720 --> 13:57.159
You'll have to explain
quite a few things.

13:57.159 --> 13:59.519
Spain is a democracy now.

13:59.519 --> 14:01.240
And our country needs us again.

14:02.720 --> 14:07.360
This man is the target.
Rodero, code name 'Hummingbird'.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.799
He's also declaring his candidacy.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.679
He's a communist.
They've been legalized.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.759
But they're behind
the Captain's kidnapping

14:17.759 --> 14:19.840
and may be allied
with the Russians.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.080
- Soviets?
- Capturing him won't be easy.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.240
Since the kidnapping,
politicians have security details.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.480
On top of that,
Rodero has received direct threats,

14:28.480 --> 14:30.759
he gets to the Congress
with bodyguards

14:30.759 --> 14:33.399
and a police patrol follows him everywhere.

14:33.399 --> 14:38.519
Although he barely leaves.
Except... For this.

14:39.480 --> 14:43.000
It's the perfect opportunity
to harvest supporters.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.279
There won't be police in the museum,
only security detail.

14:46.279 --> 14:50.000
The mission is not going to be easy.
Armed men everywhere.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.080
That won't be a problem.
Count on it.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.120
Are you sure you want
to take on the mission?

14:55.120 --> 14:59.279
Isn't it too soon?
Don't you want to rest...?

14:59.279 --> 15:01.519
No, it won't be necessary.

15:02.919 --> 15:05.879
- I'm still a man of action.
- I was sure you'd say that.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.399
You've been reinstated
at Section Nine.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.000
Welcome to the 21st Century.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.120
Hello?

15:19.720 --> 15:21.399
Hello?

15:23.399 --> 15:25.120
Hey, mate, do you have a lighter?

15:29.039 --> 15:31.399
I'm sorry, mate. Some other time.

15:37.519 --> 15:41.399
You've been hiding here waiting
for me to come out? Are you serious?

15:41.399 --> 15:42.960
No way.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.120
- How did you know I was waiting?
- That's my job.

15:48.120 --> 15:51.120
Besides, you're terrible at hiding.
Go home.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.840
No, please,
I don't understand any of this.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.440
- My father and you...
- Your father told you to go home.

15:57.440 --> 16:01.080
Well, my father also told me
he was a janitor, but no.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.200
It turns out he's like
a James Bond.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.320
- Stop!
- What do you want?

16:05.320 --> 16:09.039
I want you to tell me the truth!
My father lied to me.

16:09.039 --> 16:12.200
I'm his daughter, he should have
told me, shouldn't he?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.519
We all have secrets.
You, for example.

16:14.519 --> 16:16.799
Have you told him about that Ricardo?

16:16.799 --> 16:19.720
- I don't see what that has to do...
- Why haven't you?

16:21.159 --> 16:25.399
I don't know. Because...
Because he's very old and...

16:26.600 --> 16:30.320
In his days, things were different,
he's always worried about me...

16:30.320 --> 16:32.799
So you don't tell him
because you love him

16:32.799 --> 16:34.919
and you don't want him to worry.

16:34.919 --> 16:36.320
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.159
No. It's not the same thing.
I mean, not at all.

16:41.159 --> 16:43.879
It's got nothing to do with it.
How about you?

16:43.879 --> 16:47.399
- You're working for my father?
- I'm sorry, that's confidential.

16:47.399 --> 16:49.159
- So you are!
- Antonia...

16:49.159 --> 16:51.840
- Are you on a mission...
- This is it. Go home.

16:51.840 --> 16:56.320
Keep it all to yourself if you want.
But you've got a phone, I saw it.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.559
So I'm going to give you my number
just in case.

16:59.559 --> 17:02.320
Call me or text me,
whatever you want.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.720
By the way,
you should set your Face ID.

17:06.839 --> 17:10.640
- Never mind.
- Thank you for everything, Antonia.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.839
Get back home right away.
Don't make your dad worry.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.680
Hard days are waiting ahead
for all of us.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.680
BREAKING NEWS
RIOTS CONTINUE IN MADRID

17:29.359 --> 17:35.559
<i>Protests continue. Rodero,
what can you say about this?</i>

17:35.559 --> 17:37.880
<i>Jesús, this is what happens
every time</i>

17:37.880 --> 17:40.440
<i>you put a microphone
in front of Hernando</i>

17:40.440 --> 17:42.920
<i>and he accuses us
of the kidnapping...</i>

17:42.920 --> 17:46.759
<i>Our HQ has been assaulted
and we have been threatened...</i>

17:46.759 --> 17:49.880
Here he goes again.
What a pain.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.480
<i>...in the streets
but also at the ballot box.</i>

17:52.480 --> 17:55.880
Enough. There's no space
for whining in politics.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.799
Hernando, this has to end.

17:57.799 --> 18:00.440
We've dropped two points
in the polls.

18:01.640 --> 18:06.720
- What the fuck do these people want?
- Less yelling and more results.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.759
They want us to find Captain
and get things back to normal.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.599
- If you had done...
- Look.

18:11.599 --> 18:14.319
Don't start now
with the fucking "I told you so."

18:14.319 --> 18:16.720
I show my face
to defend the President!

18:16.720 --> 18:19.720
The President's retired,
but we can make a statement.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.799
The President's old.
He's not retired, he's finished.

18:22.799 --> 18:25.200
He's useless
for this or anything else.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.640
Rodero is right.
You're campaigning.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.240
If the Captain isn't located, someone
will have to take her place.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.440
- Step up for the Election...
- Wow.

18:35.440 --> 18:39.480
Mr. Secretary of State,
took you a while to figure that out.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.240
You're old too. This party's full
of old men and goddamn fogies.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.480
But this is going to change.
We need young blood here...

18:59.359 --> 19:02.480
Excuse me. Mr. Secretary,
I need to speak with you.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.160
Jaime, please,
we're in a meeting.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.880
This is really important,
and it will be a matter of a minute.

19:09.880 --> 19:14.359
Tend to him. We're finished here.
I'm going to make some calls.

19:19.240 --> 19:23.119
So, what is it?
Is the maintenance room on fire?

19:23.119 --> 19:25.680
No, it's not on fire.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.920
Well, unless there's a fire,
don't ever knock on this door

19:28.920 --> 19:31.720
or interrupt a meeting again,
do you understand?

19:31.720 --> 19:35.160
- I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
- Good.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.359
But if you'd like to be a Minister
in the next government,

19:38.359 --> 19:40.279
you should listen to me.

19:44.279 --> 19:46.480
What did you say?

19:46.480 --> 19:51.359
Hernando puffs up like a peacock
in front of the cameras.

19:51.359 --> 19:54.559
But he doesn't know how to solve
this crisis. He's terrified.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.160
Come with me and I promise
that you will be the hero

20:01.160 --> 20:04.759
who solves it and will be all over
the press, Mr. Secretary.

20:07.559 --> 20:10.640
Okay. Of course, don't worry...

20:10.640 --> 20:13.160
<i>Put a hundred more.</i>

20:13.160 --> 20:16.039
- What's that machine?
- An industrial scale.

20:16.039 --> 20:20.599
- How much is he lifting?
- Around a ton.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.960
- Mother of God.
- He's impressive, isn't he?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.720
Let's see. Look, Jaime,

20:29.720 --> 20:33.400
I appreciate you trusting me
and telling me all this.

20:33.400 --> 20:38.119
About Section Nine, about this man,
or whatever he is.

20:38.119 --> 20:40.559
But we're in the middle of a crisis,

20:40.559 --> 20:44.480
- and there's no time to lose.
- Hernando is in a headlong rush.

20:44.480 --> 20:48.480
He leaked that the police are
investigating left-wing groups.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.799
I'm not saying Rodero is behind
the Captain's kidnapping,

20:51.799 --> 20:54.400
but he's not telling all he knows.

20:54.400 --> 20:58.599
The police can't question him
because they have no evidence.

21:00.599 --> 21:03.680
- But we can.
- Hold on. Hold on.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.759
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

21:08.759 --> 21:11.359
I ask you to save the Captain
and this country,

21:11.359 --> 21:14.200
- because no one else can do it.
- No, Jaime, no.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.480
In my position, if this got out,
I'd be a disaster.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.480
You're not going to do it.
He's going to do it.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.359
If all goes to plan,
we'll set Catalina Bellido free

21:23.359 --> 21:25.839
and we'll turn Rodero in
to the authorities.

21:25.839 --> 21:28.000
And when the Captain is president,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.079
she'll be grateful to the man
who saved her.

21:30.079 --> 21:31.759
What if it goes wrong?

21:31.759 --> 21:34.880
If it goes wrong...
García doesn't exist.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.759
There's no record in the system.

21:36.759 --> 21:39.319
For all intents and purposes,
he's a ghost.

21:40.559 --> 21:42.839
No one could ever connect him to you.

21:46.799 --> 21:51.240
- And is he willing?
- He will be, don't worry.

21:52.880 --> 21:57.839
No one has sacrificed himself more
for his country like that man.

22:16.599 --> 22:18.279
All clear.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.759
Oh, my God! Take a picture!

22:35.759 --> 22:37.960
He's coming! Hey, don't push me!

22:57.920 --> 23:01.000
Hello, Mr. Rodero.
Do you mind if we get some pictures?

23:14.119 --> 23:17.119
Sir. "Hummingbird" is entering.

23:17.119 --> 23:19.920
- Agent García, do you hear us?
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>

23:19.920 --> 23:23.240
"Hummingbird" is entering.
He has three bodyguards with him.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.720
Do you hear me, Agent García?

23:25.720 --> 23:28.799
Don't you think that you can drop
the formality?

23:28.799 --> 23:33.440
<i>- It won't seem strange to you?</i>
- I haven't seen you in 60 years.

23:33.440 --> 23:38.079
Last week you didn't have to shave,
and now you're bald.

23:38.079 --> 23:40.680
I could get used to it.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.240
This guy is a hell of a kid.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.759
<i>Hold on.</i>

23:44.759 --> 23:47.519
<i>How many meters left
for the engine room?</i>

23:47.519 --> 23:51.920
Let's see... Let me check the map.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.680
From the opening in the sewers
you should have...

23:54.680 --> 23:56.720
...ten meters left. Why?

23:56.720 --> 23:58.720
I can't continue. It's impossible.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.200
It is sealed
with reinforced concrete.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.400
No. It can't be.
It's not on the map.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.599
The map is at least thirty years old.

24:05.599 --> 24:08.400
- I assume it's been restored.
- There is no time.

24:08.400 --> 24:12.039
I don't care what the map says,
we need another way in.

24:12.039 --> 24:14.880
Other than the front door,
it's our only way into the museum.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.079
- Do we abort?
<i>- No...</i>

24:18.079 --> 24:19.839
<i>What is it right on top of me?</i>

24:19.839 --> 24:22.599
You're below a photographic negatives storehouse.

24:22.599 --> 24:28.240
There're some phone lines, a pipe,
and a one meter wall.

24:30.279 --> 24:33.839
<i>- What are you going to do?</i>
- Make my way in.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.480
Good! Good. He's in!

25:03.759 --> 25:05.000
I'm in.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.759
- Wait. Where is he?
- I don't know. He disappeared.

25:11.279 --> 25:14.519
García. García.
Do you copy me?

25:21.720 --> 25:25.960
- Ortiz. Ortiz, do you copy me?
- I think he can't hear us.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.440
Must be the frequency inhibitors.
I'll search in another channel.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.519
Nothing.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.440
Get him back!

25:53.480 --> 25:57.559
- Clear entry point.
- There he is! Boss!

25:57.559 --> 25:59.720
Where?

25:59.720 --> 26:01.200
- Shit!
- What's happening?

26:01.200 --> 26:03.599
- He's heading for a meeting point.
- What?

26:03.599 --> 26:05.240
Two agents.

26:10.759 --> 26:14.680
- Excuse me, sir. You can't be here.
- Thank God. I think I'm lost.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.319
Didn't you see the sign?

26:16.319 --> 26:18.799
Yes, but I needed to go
to the toilet and...

26:18.799 --> 26:20.839
<i>García! García, do you copy me?</i>

26:20.839 --> 26:23.920
I don't understand.
Police, civil guards, security...

26:23.920 --> 26:26.160
Where the hell
do these two come from?

26:26.160 --> 26:29.559
But I ended up lost on my way back.
Thank God, I found you.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.519
Come with me, I'll show you the way.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.720
- They're escorting him to the room.
- Unbelievable.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.640
There are no longer agents like him
in the NIC or the Armed Forces.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.279
It's so hard to quit smoking.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.240
Good luck with that.

26:59.079 --> 27:00.799
The device is ready.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.960
Excuse me.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.200
<i>Confirm your position.</i>

27:38.319 --> 27:41.440
Copy. I'm inside.
I've located "Hummingbird."

27:41.440 --> 27:46.960
- Are you sure it's here?
- Aquilino said he always comes here.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.759
Want some?

27:48.759 --> 27:50.640
- What's that?
- Almonds.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.279
If you don' want any,
don't worry, I've got everything.

27:53.279 --> 27:57.839
A bottle of water, pistachios,
raisins, chocolate,

27:57.839 --> 28:00.559
some magazines,
in case this really goes on...

28:00.559 --> 28:03.359
- Aspirin, omelet...
- Omelet?

28:03.359 --> 28:05.039
I know, it's too much,

28:05.039 --> 28:07.240
but the container
could come in handy,

28:07.240 --> 28:10.720
in case we need to save
a dismembered member.

28:10.720 --> 28:14.880
- What are you saying?
- I'm kidding. In case we want to pee.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.200
Someone's coming!

28:20.920 --> 28:24.160
Do you think that's him?
He doesn't look like a secret agent.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.000
Where are you going?
Let's build a strategy!

28:36.000 --> 28:37.960
- Wait here.
- Hold on!

28:41.079 --> 28:43.279
Antonia!
Antonia, wait!

28:43.279 --> 28:46.359
- I told you to wait!
- Why?

28:46.359 --> 28:51.119
I don't know. Look, if I'm not here
in 15 minutes, wait another 15.

29:12.839 --> 29:15.000
Girl! A rum on the rocks.

29:19.119 --> 29:21.880
Hi. Excuse me. Are you Barea?

29:21.880 --> 29:25.119
- I'm a friend of Aquilino.
- You're the journalist, right?

29:25.119 --> 29:27.200
I've got nothing to say to you.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.200
Tell Aquilino
he's a son of a bitch.

29:32.880 --> 29:36.000
I am a journalist,
but I'm also Jaime's daughter.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.480
I mean Ortiz's.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.920
You do look like him.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.960
But you look more like your mother.

29:45.960 --> 29:49.640
Yeah, that's what my father says.
Did you know her?

29:49.640 --> 29:51.920
Many years ago...

29:51.920 --> 29:54.200
It's just a long story.

29:55.279 --> 29:57.359
Well, I'm not in a hurry.

30:00.599 --> 30:05.240
Look, you're not going to like
what I have to say.

30:06.519 --> 30:08.200
Ladies and gentlemen.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.720
It's an honor for me to receive here,
at the National Museum,

30:11.720 --> 30:14.599
Your Majesties,
the King and Queen of Spain.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.839
His Highness is tall.

30:29.839 --> 30:31.319
<i>The son of Juan Carlos.</i>

30:31.319 --> 30:34.519
You knew I him as a prince.
He abdicated seven years ago.

30:34.519 --> 30:37.599
Juanito.
What about her?

30:37.599 --> 30:40.119
<i>A commoner. And divorced.</i>

30:40.119 --> 30:44.720
- Divorced?
- Divorce has been legal since 1981.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.039
- Thank God.
- Benito.

30:48.359 --> 30:51.960
Thank you.
I'd like to thank you for coming,

30:51.960 --> 30:56.119
especially Your Majesties
and Mr. Hernando and Mr. Rodero

30:56.119 --> 30:58.599
for joining us
on this special occasion.

30:58.599 --> 31:01.839
I'd like to begin this act
with a toast.

31:01.839 --> 31:04.160
Well, we're all vaccinated, right?

31:06.640 --> 31:08.960
How long
till the device is activated?

31:08.960 --> 31:11.160
- Two minutes.
- Here we go.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.039
"The Surrender of Breda"
represents

31:13.039 --> 31:15.240
a crucial moment in the history
of Spain.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.119
General Spinola sieged the city
of Breda.

31:18.119 --> 31:20.519
Justino van Nassau
defended it for a year.

31:20.519 --> 31:24.119
This battle left thousands
of people dead.

31:24.119 --> 31:26.240
Velázquez pictured the exact moment

31:26.240 --> 31:29.440
when Nassau delivers the keys
of the city to his enemy.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.440
Spinola doesn't allow Nassau
to kneel before him.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.519
It's a moment of harmony,

31:34.519 --> 31:37.759
of recognizing the values
that both share and fight for.

31:37.759 --> 31:41.599
Honor, bravery
and love for the homeland.

31:41.599 --> 31:45.640
Four centuries later,
we toast for the same values.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.319
To the harmony. To the unity.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.400
Excuse me.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.279
- Give me a minute, boys.
- We've got a problem.

32:14.279 --> 32:16.480
-"Hummingbird" is leaving the room.
- What's up now?

32:16.480 --> 32:19.319
<i>A phone call.
It seems important.</i>

32:19.319 --> 32:21.839
It's his wife.
They're having a baby.

32:21.839 --> 32:23.240
Just now.

32:24.279 --> 32:26.119
I got this.
Excuse me.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.200
- Mr. Rodero.
- Yes?

32:31.200 --> 32:32.680
Hold on, baby.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.559
- Come with me, please.
- Why? Who are you?

32:35.559 --> 32:38.200
Thirty seconds till the device
is activated.

32:38.200 --> 32:42.599
We've received a bomb threat.
We have to get out of the building.

32:42.599 --> 32:44.480
- Come with me.
- What?

32:45.759 --> 32:48.799
- Show me your ID.
- There's no time. I've got orders.

32:48.799 --> 32:51.759
Come with me, please.
And tell me your full name.

32:51.759 --> 32:54.119
<i>Five seconds.</i>

32:56.240 --> 33:00.240
Three, two... one...

33:00.240 --> 33:01.839
My name is...

33:14.160 --> 33:15.400
Over here!

33:17.000 --> 33:19.039
Quickly! They're over there!

33:19.039 --> 33:22.359
Come on. Go, go, go!

33:22.359 --> 33:24.279
Don't let him get away!

33:26.559 --> 33:28.960
- But who are you?
- Starting extraction.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.759
Extraction? Extraction of what?

33:32.240 --> 33:34.240
Stop!

33:53.359 --> 33:57.880
- No, no! Wait, wait! Wait!
- I got him. I'm on my way.

33:57.880 --> 34:01.039
- Perfect.
- Wait! Wait!

34:02.799 --> 34:05.279
You're the people
who took the Captain, right?

34:05.279 --> 34:07.359
Are you going to kill me?

34:07.359 --> 34:09.840
I'm going to have a child,
don't hurt me.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.639
Please, I'm begging you.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.119
Don't let them escape! Quickly!

34:17.800 --> 34:19.599
Freeze! Don't move!

34:19.599 --> 34:23.000
<i>García, do you copy me?</i>

34:23.000 --> 34:25.920
Loud and clear.
Everything under control.

34:31.119 --> 34:33.280
- Shit!
- What now?

34:33.280 --> 34:35.440
They found him. They're armed.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.440
Agent García.

34:44.119 --> 34:45.519
Agent García.

34:47.039 --> 34:49.320
Agent García, do you copy me?

34:51.800 --> 34:53.559
<i>Target secured.</i>

34:55.400 --> 34:57.039
Bless God!

35:08.719 --> 35:12.159
Aquilino told me some things,
but my father and García nothing.

35:12.159 --> 35:14.280
I've got tons of questions.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.719
Who created the Section Nine?
What are its missions?

35:16.719 --> 35:19.400
You think all this is great fun,
don't you?

35:19.400 --> 35:21.599
It's like a spy film!

35:21.599 --> 35:27.559
My father is a super-secret agent!
It's so exciting!

35:27.559 --> 35:31.920
- Listen, I'm not saying that.
- Then what the fuck are you saying?

35:31.920 --> 35:35.960
- What do you want to know?
- Well... The truth?

35:35.960 --> 35:37.920
I told you, you won't like it.

35:37.920 --> 35:41.440
- Well, I still want to hear it.
- Oh, really?

35:43.599 --> 35:48.679
Then, your father's not a patriot
who fights for freedom and justice.

35:48.679 --> 35:50.400
He's a bastard.

35:52.039 --> 35:54.480
And we're lucky there aren't others
like him.

35:56.639 --> 36:01.239
Section Nine was created
to help this country.

36:01.239 --> 36:03.920
And for a time, it did.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.440
Until your father took the reins.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.840
The best thing democracy did
was putting an end to it.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.159
I'd have locked your father
up myself

36:13.159 --> 36:15.280
- and thrown the key away.
- What?

36:15.280 --> 36:19.639
Think of all the horrible things
that you know about that time,

36:19.639 --> 36:21.880
multiply them by a thousand.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.800
And imagine your father
giving the orders.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.480
No... No, you're lying!

36:27.480 --> 36:31.119
Because my father...
My father is a good person.

36:31.119 --> 36:35.159
Believe what you want, kid.
I don't give a fuck.

36:38.599 --> 36:40.400
Another rum, please.

36:43.519 --> 36:45.639
<i>Easy. Easy, easy!</i>

36:47.719 --> 36:49.159
<i>That's it.</i>

36:50.360 --> 36:53.280
<i>- It's okay. All good.</i>
- Thank you.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.280
<i>- Aren't you going to eat?</i>
- You're still in top form.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.039
- We're still a great team.
- Yeah.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.599
- Hell of a kid...
- What are you going to do with him?

37:03.599 --> 37:07.760
Whatever is necessary until
he tells us where the Captain is.

37:07.760 --> 37:10.559
There's something
I wanted to tell you.

37:10.559 --> 37:13.639
Rodero said something to me.
Something very strange.

37:13.639 --> 37:16.480
He asked me if we were involved
in the kidnapping.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.800
Of course.
He wanted to confuse you.

37:20.280 --> 37:24.119
He asked me if we had killed her.
He was afraid I'd kill him too.

37:24.119 --> 37:27.920
- Are you sure that he's involved?
- There's no doubt.

37:29.559 --> 37:31.400
I'll come for the interrogation.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.880
There's no need to.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.239
Take some time off
and forget about it.

37:35.239 --> 37:36.920
Devotion first, Ortiz.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.119
- I could do it myself.
- No, no.

37:39.119 --> 37:42.320
You just keep a low profile
until things calm down,

37:42.320 --> 37:43.960
and leave the strategy to me.

37:43.960 --> 37:47.880
- I don't think that's necessary.
- I'm not used to being questioned.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.719
And especially not by an agent.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.800
I understand that you still think
we're colleagues,

37:54.800 --> 37:57.320
but that hasn't been true
for 60 years.

37:59.119 --> 38:02.480
- Now you're my boss.
- I am.

38:02.480 --> 38:06.679
You told me to be a man.
Well, I am now.

38:13.639 --> 38:17.280
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to speak to you like that.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.079
And I didn't mean
to question your orders.

38:23.599 --> 38:26.960
You're right.
Let me know when you need something.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.440
- I'm going to get changed.
- Your suit is not ready yet.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.800
60-year-old blood
is really difficult to clean.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.519
Thanks, Benito.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.159
García.

38:40.119 --> 38:42.480
More instructions?

38:42.480 --> 38:43.960
A gift.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.320
- What is this?
- Feli's address.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.400
- She's still alive?
- I imagined you'd react that way.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.679
Is she all right? Does she know?

38:56.679 --> 39:00.079
You should ask her yourself,
don't you think?

39:02.440 --> 39:08.400
<i>You have one voice message.
Today, at 18:23 hours.</i>

39:08.400 --> 39:13.119
<i>It's Antonia. I just talked to a guy
and I think you can't trust my dad.</i>

39:13.119 --> 39:15.039
<i>I know, you really know him,</i>

39:15.039 --> 39:17.800
<i>but I've been told many things
and I don't know.</i>

39:17.800 --> 39:20.480
<i>I don't even know what I'm saying.
Call me, please.</i>

39:37.119 --> 39:38.559
Hello, Antonia.

39:38.559 --> 39:41.679
<i>The number you're calling is off
or out of range.</i>

39:41.679 --> 39:43.920
<i>You can leave a message
after the beep.</i>

39:46.280 --> 39:49.320
Hello, Antonia. How are you?

39:49.320 --> 39:51.440
I hope you're well. I'm good.

39:53.159 --> 39:56.519
About your father...
I don't know what to say.

39:56.519 --> 40:00.440
We were friends, of course,
but he's not the boy I used to know.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.800
I don't know... It's been 60 years.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.679
A whole lifetime, Antonia.

40:11.400 --> 40:15.000
He has changed, I suppose.
Everything has changed so much...

40:17.159 --> 40:20.480
The only thing I know is
I can't return to Section Nine.

40:22.559 --> 40:24.880
I need to hang up.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.599
Let's talk another time. Bye.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.519
Excuse me, do you know if...?

41:03.480 --> 41:04.840
Yes?

41:09.360 --> 41:13.000
- Feli?
- Excuse me?

41:13.000 --> 41:17.239
I'm... I'm looking
for Felicidad Martínez.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.840
- And you are...?
- My name is...

41:24.840 --> 41:26.679
You.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.639
- Mom!
- Feli!

41:30.639 --> 41:36.880
- Mom? Jesus, Mom, you scared me.
- What happened?

41:36.880 --> 41:38.920
You spaced out and you fell.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.039
At least, you didn't hit your head.

41:42.039 --> 41:43.800
Have you taken your pill?

41:44.960 --> 41:49.519
Is it really you? I'm not dreaming?

41:49.519 --> 41:53.639
- Who is this?
- No, no, no. You can't be alive.

41:53.639 --> 41:55.679
It's impossible. Impossible.

41:55.679 --> 41:57.519
Maybe you did hit your head.

41:57.519 --> 41:59.679
Let's go to the hospital.

41:59.679 --> 42:01.719
- Leave us on our own, please.
- Mum?

42:01.719 --> 42:05.039
Don't worry. It's okay.
It's all right, really. Please.

42:08.719 --> 42:11.079
I'll be in the next room,
phoning the kid.

42:11.079 --> 42:12.960
- If anything happens...
- Thank you.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.960
- Do you want something to drink?
- No.

42:22.960 --> 42:27.519
Well, I do.
I'm... I'm going to make a linden.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.199
Can we talk or are you going
to send me to my room?

43:01.199 --> 43:03.920
I'll record everything,
I don't care what you say.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.519
You've come here
for me to tell you the truth.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.800
Well, this is the truth.

43:24.119 --> 43:26.840
It's the only photo I have
of my parents.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.880
They died when I was a boy.

43:28.880 --> 43:32.760
I had to live on the street,
stealing, begging...

43:32.760 --> 43:34.719
until García found me.

43:34.719 --> 43:38.280
He took care of my education.

43:38.280 --> 43:40.079
He was like a father to me.

43:40.079 --> 43:41.719
When I was old enough,

43:41.719 --> 43:43.760
I started to work in Section Nine.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.039
So you worked for Franco's regime.

43:46.039 --> 43:48.000
Well... We worked for Spain.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.800
Which was a dictatorship.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.679
Dad, I am not a fool. You did...

43:53.280 --> 43:55.119
You did bad things, didn't you?

43:55.119 --> 43:56.880
We did what we had to do.

43:56.880 --> 44:01.119
We fought for our country,
for a better country for our kids.

44:01.119 --> 44:04.039
I risked my life thousand times
and I'd do it again.

44:04.039 --> 44:07.039
So did García.
I don't expect you to understand.

44:07.039 --> 44:09.360
Things were different then.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.480
Did Mom know anything about this?

44:11.480 --> 44:15.559
No, I told her I worked
for the government, that's all.

44:16.719 --> 44:20.519
I guess over time
she would have worked it out herself.

44:20.519 --> 44:22.519
She was just as curious as you.

44:26.639 --> 44:29.480
You've never told me what happened.

44:29.480 --> 44:33.039
- You told me about the accident...
- It was quick.

44:34.559 --> 44:35.800
Thank God.

44:37.039 --> 44:38.599
I was with her to the end...

44:39.920 --> 44:43.159
- We had time.
- Time for what?

44:44.760 --> 44:46.000
To say goodbye.

44:47.360 --> 44:50.639
God took everything that night,
but at least he left us that.

44:52.719 --> 44:55.159
After that,
there isn't much more to tell.

44:55.159 --> 44:57.599
I didn't know
how to look after a baby...

44:57.599 --> 45:01.559
Thanks to the neighbors,
you didn't die when you were one.

45:03.199 --> 45:06.679
García disappeared.
Your mother as well.

45:06.679 --> 45:09.159
They were the past.

45:09.159 --> 45:11.880
You were... a new life.

45:14.199 --> 45:17.480
Then I decided that
I was never going to look back again.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.760
That's why I never told you anything.
Do you understand?

45:25.159 --> 45:27.719
Well... You've had enough for today.

45:29.360 --> 45:33.320
Dad! Dad, I... I've got a boyfriend.

45:33.320 --> 45:36.880
His name's Riki, Ricardo.
He's a bit older but he's nice.

45:36.880 --> 45:40.400
- We've been dating for a year and...
- A year and a half?

45:40.400 --> 45:44.360
A year and a half with a boy
and you didn't tell me anything?

45:44.360 --> 45:48.159
Sorry, I... I'm not one to talk.

45:49.360 --> 45:52.280
Look, call this... Ricardo.

45:52.280 --> 45:56.880
Tell him to come and have a drink,
so I can get to know him.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.880
- Really?
- Yes, really.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.239
Things have to be done properly.

46:05.079 --> 46:06.639
Open it.

46:13.239 --> 46:16.400
I thought the wedding dress
wouldn't fit you.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.519
It was your maternal grandmother's.

46:18.519 --> 46:21.400
The band is alloy,
it isn't worth much.

46:22.719 --> 46:26.559
She gave it to your mother
when we got married.

46:26.559 --> 46:30.519
I guess she would have wanted
to give it to you at the right time.

46:30.519 --> 46:32.920
We aren't living together
or anything...

46:32.920 --> 46:35.599
Well, keep it until it is the time.

46:35.599 --> 46:40.199
For tomorrow, next month,
or in ten years.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.920
I've taken a lot of things from you,

46:45.920 --> 46:48.679
and I wanted this to be
the first thing I gave back.

46:51.960 --> 46:55.400
Go on, call... Ricardo.

46:55.400 --> 46:59.280
Tell him to come.
But clean up that mess of a room.

47:00.599 --> 47:05.559
- Did you take your afternoon pill?
- Guilty as charged.

47:05.559 --> 47:08.400
Dad... I'll bring it to you.

47:24.519 --> 47:26.119

48:15.239 --> 48:17.760
Hello? Hello?

48:19.400 --> 48:23.000
Is anybody there?

48:23.000 --> 48:27.599
Help, please! Help!

48:35.920 --> 48:37.440
It's the only one I have.

48:39.599 --> 48:42.559
I threw out all the others
when you disappeared.

48:47.320 --> 48:50.920
I'm sorry, Feli. I'm so sorry.

48:50.920 --> 48:55.039
You haven't aged a single day.
How is that possible?

48:56.840 --> 48:58.360
It's...

48:59.639 --> 49:01.039
It's complicated.

49:01.039 --> 49:03.960
If you're going to lie,
better you don't say anything.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.000
- I'm not going to lie to you.
- No?

49:07.360 --> 49:09.760
You said that we were going
to get married,

49:11.039 --> 49:12.960
to have a family.

49:12.960 --> 49:18.320
You said you were going to come back,
to wait for you...

49:22.239 --> 49:23.519
Why have you come?

49:25.480 --> 49:26.719
I don't know.

49:28.719 --> 49:33.519
When I found out that you were
still alive, I suppose that...

49:33.519 --> 49:37.679
I needed to know you were all right.
That you are happy.

49:40.039 --> 49:43.880
I shouldn't have.
It's best if I leave.

49:43.880 --> 49:45.400
I looked after my mother.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.880
I worked in the hairdresser's...

49:50.239 --> 49:52.199
and I waited for you.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.480
I waited for you for so long.

49:58.480 --> 50:01.719
I didn't want to move,
in case you came back some day.

50:04.119 --> 50:06.199
So that you could find me.

50:08.559 --> 50:11.079
Then my mother died.

50:13.159 --> 50:15.039
And I got married.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.599
To a client at the hairdresser's.

50:20.039 --> 50:22.039
He'd been courting me for years.

50:23.119 --> 50:28.360
A lot of time had passed and I...
I didn't want to be on my own.

50:29.559 --> 50:33.519
Ignacio was his name.
He was an honest man.

50:33.519 --> 50:38.440
He gave me Julita,
the best thing in my life.

50:38.440 --> 50:42.119
- She looks a lot like you.
- She's a very good girl.

50:42.119 --> 50:43.480
I can't complain.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.360
I've been happy, and...

50:47.599 --> 50:49.039
I've done what I wanted.

50:52.199 --> 50:56.599
The only thing I've wondered
all these years is...

50:58.719 --> 51:01.559
if you left because...

51:01.559 --> 51:03.719
Because you didn't love me.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.039
Because you didn't love me
as I loved you.

51:13.679 --> 51:15.159
I love you, Feli.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.719
I love you more than anything
in this world.

51:21.800 --> 51:26.480
I know almost 60 years have passed,
but for me the fair was two days ago.

51:28.079 --> 51:32.639
Do you know I have never been able
to listen to that song again?

51:33.920 --> 51:35.719
I couldn't.

52:43.280 --> 52:47.440
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

53:11.039 --> 53:12.280
What is it?

53:14.760 --> 53:16.000
Follow me.

53:25.280 --> 53:28.159
- What's happening?
- I don't know. I don't...

53:28.159 --> 53:30.960
Lock the door
and hide behind the bed.

53:30.960 --> 53:32.320
- But...
- But why?

53:39.480 --> 53:42.159
Police, hands up!
Hands up!

53:47.119 --> 53:49.000
On the floor, police!

54:16.159 --> 54:17.679
Feli.

54:17.679 --> 54:22.840
- What's happening?
- Mom, don't get close.

54:22.840 --> 54:26.320
No, stop, stop! Dad, please!

55:09.079 --> 55:10.320
Mom?

55:11.960 --> 55:14.519
- Mom!
- No, don't!

55:21.920 --> 55:25.320
Mom! Mom!
