WEBVTT

00:08.759 --> 00:13.679
SOMEWHERE OVER
THE ARAGONESE PYRENEES

00:37.280 --> 00:39.640
The dictator Francisco Franco
has been ruling Spain

00:39.719 --> 00:42.320
with an iron fist for 20 years.

00:42.399 --> 00:46.200
Europe and the United States
are absorbed in the Cold War,

00:46.280 --> 00:49.280
and spies and secret agents
travel the world monitoring

00:49.359 --> 00:51.560
the enemy and carrying out
highly confidential missions.

00:57.399 --> 01:00.880
Spain has one of the best.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.120
Here they come.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.439
Look.

01:25.239 --> 01:26.799
Ready?

01:27.719 --> 01:29.680
They are the ones
who need to be ready.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.719
Hell of a kid.

01:33.719 --> 01:37.040
-Isn't it too cold?
-Don't worry about that.

01:39.079 --> 01:41.439
We are about to warm up.

01:57.239 --> 02:03.480
Stop there...
On three. One... Two...

02:03.560 --> 02:05.640
And three!

02:05.719 --> 02:09.319
Sorry,
but you have nothing else to do.

02:26.599 --> 02:28.960
Twenty years.

02:29.039 --> 02:33.560
For 20 years I've been working
day and night,

02:33.639 --> 02:37.800
experimenting to create
the perfect soldier.

02:37.879 --> 02:41.560
Trained for combat and discipline,

02:41.639 --> 02:44.919
who obeys every order
without hesitating.

02:46.159 --> 02:51.120
But the problem with soldiers
is that they used to be men.

02:51.199 --> 02:55.719
And men have ridiculous weaknesses

02:55.800 --> 02:58.879
which, apparently,
they cannot do without.

03:01.319 --> 03:04.960
And a weak soldier
will not serve the objective.

03:21.439 --> 03:24.199
García!

03:24.280 --> 03:26.120
And Ortíz!

03:30.680 --> 03:32.599
Wait.

03:36.599 --> 03:40.319
I'll rid the world of your horrors,
even if it's the last thing I do.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.840
What you call horror, Mr. García,

03:42.919 --> 03:44.520
I call it future.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.560
Shoot them!

04:03.439 --> 04:04.680
Ortíz?

04:14.280 --> 04:17.160
My reports say
that you've never lost a fight.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.199
Your reports are correct.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.360
Until now.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.759
You can't win García.

04:35.839 --> 04:37.240
Not against me.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.439
Any last words, García?
Nothing for posterity?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.319
Not bad?

04:55.399 --> 04:56.639
What?

05:03.279 --> 05:07.000
My father is right,
I'm stronger than you.

05:07.079 --> 05:10.319
-I'm the future!
-You talk too much.

05:16.240 --> 05:20.600
I don't... Talk... Too... Much!

05:48.800 --> 05:52.040
Relax, you're going to be okay.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.800
-Let go of him.
-You just killed my son.

05:55.879 --> 05:58.920
I won't hesitate to blow
your friend's head off.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.040
-Surrender. Now.
-Don't listen to him, Mr. García!

06:03.120 --> 06:05.399
Smash this lowlife's face in!

06:12.920 --> 06:15.720
Men's weakness.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.079
Never forget it, Mr. Ortíz.

06:41.519 --> 06:46.079
And we are back to bring you
the latest news of these tight votes,

06:46.160 --> 06:48.800
that are keeping all of Spain
on the edge.

06:48.879 --> 06:54.000
Tonight we have very special guests
so we can go through every pact,

06:54.079 --> 06:56.360
<i>alliances and strategies.</i>

06:56.439 --> 07:00.920
Madam. Madam. We've arrived.

07:08.439 --> 07:12.319
MADRID NOWADAYS

07:15.720 --> 07:19.319
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow at eight.

07:19.399 --> 07:21.079
You wouldn't like me to wait?

07:21.160 --> 07:25.480
No. I'm just going to pick up
a few things and go straight home.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.720
See you tomorrow.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.680
For Christ's sake, Manolo.
What are you doing here?

07:46.759 --> 07:48.920
Catalina... I'm sorry.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.279
-Maybe this isn't the time.
-Or the place.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.759
Indeed.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.759
The Russians. They're seething.
I don't know what to tell them...

07:56.839 --> 08:00.959
-You'll think of something.
-It's... They... they call my home.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.959
They follow me to the office...

08:03.040 --> 08:06.240
They want to know
about the flats in Lloret de Mar.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.360
Now we cannot make
any kind of move.

08:08.439 --> 08:09.839
I know.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.800
With that corruption thing.

08:11.879 --> 08:13.279
I know, I know...

08:13.360 --> 08:16.040
They must wait after the elections.
We'll fix it.

08:16.120 --> 08:20.519
I can't tell them that.
Those people are dangerous.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.079
-You said if there was a problem...
-What?

08:23.160 --> 08:26.000
-Don't you remember about our talk?
-No, no, no.

08:26.079 --> 08:28.160
I didn't say anything at all.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.680
I don't know
what you're talking about

08:30.759 --> 08:32.519
or who those Russians are.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.039
I see...

08:35.360 --> 08:36.720
That's clear, right?

08:41.840 --> 08:46.559
-You are pissing me off now...
-Catalina.

08:46.639 --> 08:49.519
Catalina, please.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.360
-Cash or card?
-Cash.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.320
-Good evening.
-Have a good night, Captain.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.440
Catalina Bellido
New Democracy

09:12.039 --> 09:13.679
-Tell me.
<i>-Can you talk?</i>

09:13.759 --> 09:15.159
Yes, I can.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.120
So how do you feel about
#WithOurCaptainAllTogether?

09:17.200 --> 09:20.399
No. I don't like that.
"Captain Catalina" is better.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.879
<i>-Let's keep that one then.</i>
-Okay. I don't care what you do.

09:23.960 --> 09:27.360
It needs to be a trending topic
before the interview at 12 p.m.

09:29.279 --> 09:30.840
<i>Okay. I'll be updating you.</i>

09:34.519 --> 09:35.759
<i>Captain?</i>

09:37.039 --> 09:40.000
<i>Captain?</i>
<i>Captain, are you still there?</i>

09:41.720 --> 09:45.200
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Captain, I cannot hear you?</i>

09:46.679 --> 09:47.919
<i>Captain?</i>

10:50.879 --> 10:56.679
<i>"Wake up, Spain" with Aquilino.</i>
<i>Good morning listeners.</i>

10:56.759 --> 11:01.200
<i>It's been 24 hours</i>
<i>since we've heard the news</i>

11:01.279 --> 11:05.720
<i>of Catalina Bellido's disappearance.</i>
<i>Presidential Candidate.</i>

11:05.799 --> 11:08.799
<i>And what has been done?</i>

11:08.879 --> 11:12.960
<i>What decisions have been made</i>
<i>in this unprecedented crisis?</i>

11:13.039 --> 11:16.679
<i>None.</i>
<i>Spain is on the brink of disaster.</i>

11:16.759 --> 11:19.000
<i>With the elections</i>
<i>around the corner,</i>

11:19.080 --> 11:21.960
<i>the government doesn't dare</i>
<i>to step up.</i>

11:22.039 --> 11:26.159
<i>These vanilla conservatives</i>
<i>aren't going to say the truth.</i>

11:26.240 --> 11:30.639
<i>Today's newspapers say that</i>
<i>Catalina Bellido, our "Captain",</i>

11:30.720 --> 11:32.039
<i>has "disappeared".</i>

11:33.000 --> 11:38.080
<i>...Calling things by their name,</i>
<i>but the decent citizens,</i>

11:38.159 --> 11:45.000
<i>the workers who wake up at 7 a.m.</i>
<i>for this country...</i>

12:00.440 --> 12:03.600
Fuck! Riki!

12:05.919 --> 12:07.440
-What time is it?
-Late.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.919
My father is up.
You didn't set the alarm.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.799
-I have to pee.
-You can piss in the street!

12:12.879 --> 12:16.720
Fuck! Give me a good morning kiss,
or not even that?

12:16.799 --> 12:19.080
A slap is what I'll give you.

12:19.159 --> 12:22.159
You're 23 years old,
why do you keep up with this crap?

12:22.240 --> 12:25.600
-You don't know my father.
-And at this pace I never will.

12:25.679 --> 12:29.879
I'm not asking you to marry me.
I just want you to introduce me.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.960
My father is... He's a very old man,
and very old fashioned.

12:34.039 --> 12:36.080
It's best to tell him gradually.

12:36.159 --> 12:39.120
Soon he'll kick the bucket
and we won't have to tell him.

12:40.639 --> 12:43.919
-I didn't mean to...
-No. No.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.320
-Good morning.
-My dear, how did you sleep?

12:47.399 --> 12:48.799
Yes, yes...

12:48.879 --> 12:51.559
I've made breakfast.
I'll keep you company.

12:54.159 --> 12:56.039
Thanks, Dad.

13:01.639 --> 13:04.559
And you? Did you sleep well?

13:04.639 --> 13:08.039
I'm having a hard time sleeping.
Every noise wakes me.

13:09.879 --> 13:11.360
Did you hear noises?

13:11.440 --> 13:14.799
My dear, at night in these houses
you hear everything.

13:16.200 --> 13:20.159
It's true, I've heard things too.
The people upstairs, probably.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.639
Probably.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.960
<i>...Marxists in the street...</i>

13:24.039 --> 13:26.279
How can you listen
to that fascist?

13:26.360 --> 13:29.080
Aquilino? I like him.
I find him amusing.

13:29.159 --> 13:32.039
They never tell us anything
at the ministry.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.600
Yeah, I can imagine.

13:38.159 --> 13:39.679
Aren't you going to be late?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.399
Fuck! Shit!

13:45.559 --> 13:47.399
Hell of a kid.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.080
-Honey, wait! You're 2-B, right?
-Yes.

13:52.159 --> 13:55.960
So... Here. Take the envelope.
It doesn't fit in your letterbox.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.919
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.840
Fuck!

14:41.919 --> 14:44.559
I'm so sorry. So sorry.
Are you okay?

14:44.639 --> 14:46.159
What?

14:46.240 --> 14:49.279
What's your problem?
Are you blind or what?

14:49.360 --> 14:52.159
What's your problem?
Didn't you get laid last night?

14:52.240 --> 14:58.000
-You almost killed me, dickhead!
-Calm down, queen.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.679
And smile, it will do you good.

15:00.759 --> 15:06.840
-Moron!
-Slut! Fucking bikes! Move!

15:19.840 --> 15:22.759
-Fucking move!
-I'm on it. Fuck!

15:24.360 --> 15:27.720
<i>Indeed the President of Economy,</i>
<i>Catalina Bellido,</i>

15:27.799 --> 15:30.559
<i>who was front cover of all</i>
<i>the newspapers three months ago,</i>

15:30.639 --> 15:34.039
<i>when the President Seijas announced</i>
<i>he wouldn't seek re-election</i>

15:34.120 --> 15:38.240
<i>and backed the Captain,</i>
<i>as the party candidate.</i>

15:38.320 --> 15:41.799
<i>Although the polls found her</i>
<i>more than likely to win,</i>

15:41.879 --> 15:45.399
<i>her campaign was tainted</i>
<i>by accusations of corruption...</i>

15:45.480 --> 15:46.879
Turn it up!

15:46.960 --> 15:50.600
<i>With the elections only a week away,</i>
<i>the Captain's disappearance</i>

15:50.679 --> 15:53.480
<i>caused commotion</i>
<i>among the members of her party...</i>

15:53.559 --> 15:56.159
<i>The Minister of home affairs,</i>
<i>Hernando.</i>

15:56.240 --> 15:58.559
-Minister!
-Minister!

15:58.639 --> 16:00.759
Mr. Hernando, please! Any statement?

16:00.840 --> 16:02.519
Do you know anything?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.559
-Minister!
-Minister, a question, please!

16:04.639 --> 16:06.519
-Remember what we talked earlier.
-Yes.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.639
If I do the signal
you don't come near me.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.720
-Understood?
-Yes. As you command.

16:10.799 --> 16:13.960
Hernando! Do you know anything
about the Captain?

16:14.039 --> 16:15.480
Minister, please!

16:15.559 --> 16:18.200
-Good morning.
-You confirm it is a kidnapping?

16:18.279 --> 16:19.879
It's a possibility.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.200
It could be a revolutionary group,

16:22.279 --> 16:23.919
linked to the extreme left.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.320
Those accusations are very serious!

16:26.399 --> 16:29.200
Have the kidnappers contacted you
for a ransom?

16:29.279 --> 16:30.799
I can't comment further.

16:30.879 --> 16:32.360
-Thank you.
-Minister!

16:32.440 --> 16:36.399
Mr. Osorio, how do you feel
about the disappearance of your boss?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.120
Devastated.

16:38.200 --> 16:41.440
Ms. Bellido is not only my boss,
she's also my friend.

16:41.519 --> 16:45.480
Are you appointing another candidate
if Ms. Bellido is not released?

16:45.559 --> 16:48.440
The press conference is at four.
Thank you very much.

16:48.519 --> 16:52.159
Please, Minister, one last question.
Mr. Hernando!

16:52.240 --> 16:54.519
-Fuck!
-Look. Take a look.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.039
<i>You heard the declarations</i>
<i>of Mr. Hernando and Mr. Osorio.</i>

16:58.120 --> 17:00.879
<i>Harsh allegations from the minister,</i>

17:00.960 --> 17:06.400
<i>who said left extremists</i>
<i>are surely involved in the kidnap...</i>

17:14.920 --> 17:16.519
Coffee break's over, folks.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.720
Sonia and Raúl, you do
last minute, web and social media.

17:19.799 --> 17:22.400
The rest of you,
I want depth and detail.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.559
Regarding
the extreme left-wing group,

17:24.640 --> 17:27.839
I don't know where Hernando got that,
let's look into it.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.000
Alba, reactions from everyone.

17:30.079 --> 17:33.319
The family isn't making statements,
talk to Osorio.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.480
Gema, talk to the police spokesman.
Get Rodero and I double your salary.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.559
Yes. Yes.
Silvia, opinions from Culture.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.720
Musicians, writers, film directors,
chefs... Everyone.

17:45.799 --> 17:49.319
-Someone who'll badmouth Bellido too.
-Great. Opinions.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.640
Everyone get to work, now.
I have a meeting in 20.

17:54.279 --> 17:55.559
Fuck.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.319
-Antonia?
-Yes, Verdú...

18:01.559 --> 18:02.920
To my office.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.480
-It was only 10 minutes.
-Today.

18:14.680 --> 18:18.839
There was a lot of traffic, but
the press conference was delayed--

18:18.920 --> 18:23.319
Why are you here?
Why are you here, at Crónica 24?

18:26.200 --> 18:29.440
-Because I'm a journalist?
-An intern?

18:30.440 --> 18:31.839
Well, yes.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.000
You got your degree, and good grades,
that's why we took you on.

18:37.079 --> 18:38.759
"Good level of English.

18:38.839 --> 18:42.200
Responsibility, seriousness,
organization.

18:42.279 --> 18:43.720
Very keen to work."

18:45.119 --> 18:47.359
People normally lie
about their English.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.680
It's true.
You can check the English--

18:49.759 --> 18:51.799
You've been here three months,

18:51.880 --> 18:54.720
and when you leave
no one will remember you.

18:54.799 --> 18:57.480
You do what you're told.
And you do it well.

18:57.559 --> 19:00.400
You deliver on time.
I rarely alter your texts.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.359
-But...?
-But this isn't the army.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.440
When have you bothered
to suggest a topic?

19:06.519 --> 19:08.400
Or bring in a story?

19:08.480 --> 19:11.680
-Look at Pablo...
-Pablo?

19:11.759 --> 19:13.480
He joined us at the same time.

19:13.559 --> 19:17.400
He doesn't have your qualifications,
but he grinds, he proposes things.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.799
He goes out with Alonso,
Josep, Ismael...

19:20.880 --> 19:24.039
-With the board if he had to.
-Pablo is an ass kisser,

19:24.119 --> 19:26.759
but he suggested a report
on soccer corruption.

19:26.839 --> 19:30.160
It was thrown out,
but he showed he has attitude.

19:30.240 --> 19:34.200
-I can bring stories better than his.
-And you don't do it because...

19:35.720 --> 19:38.720
Because...
they'd go straight into the bin.

19:38.799 --> 19:42.880
-It's not about being a journalist.
-And what is it about, exactly?

19:43.960 --> 19:45.400
I'll tell you.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.400
When do you finish your internship?
Monday, right?

19:50.119 --> 19:52.359
Well, if they pick anyone,
it'll be Pablo.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.880
What?

19:57.960 --> 20:01.000
Don't act as if you didn't care
because you do.

20:01.079 --> 20:04.599
-Start moving.
-They only give me silly news.

20:04.680 --> 20:09.359
Yesterday, I was writing an article
about Madrid's Top 10 ramen.

20:09.440 --> 20:14.000
-Not bad. We've all been interns.
-Yes, and so is Pablo.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.440
He's working on
extreme left-wing groups.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.960
Verdú says he has "attitude".

20:19.039 --> 20:21.319
What he's got is his head up his ass.

20:21.400 --> 20:25.680
If they don't give you topics,
wake up and bring something.

20:25.759 --> 20:27.519
-Like what?
-I don't know.

20:27.599 --> 20:31.119
You think if I knew I would
still be working about famous people.

20:32.519 --> 20:33.759
Right.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.039
And who is this?

20:38.119 --> 20:40.279
No idea.
Trust me, he's not current.

20:40.359 --> 20:43.720
He's a... better looking version
of Gregory Peck, isn't he?

20:43.799 --> 20:46.039
-Who?
-An actor. Really, love...

20:46.119 --> 20:49.640
-You know what K-pop is?
-No.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.720
Well, shut it.

20:54.079 --> 20:56.759
Look. The postwoman gave me that
this morning.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.000
The envelope has no return address.

20:59.079 --> 21:00.960
It must be for your father.

21:01.039 --> 21:03.960
No way.
He gets all his mail at the Ministry.

21:04.039 --> 21:07.839
Okay, so let's start by focusing
on the details.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.000
Well, it's obviously not advertising.

21:10.079 --> 21:13.640
The paper's really old.
The paper is genuinely old.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.839
There was this as well.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.880
-What is it?
-No clue. It doesn't fit in my pc.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.119
-Maybe it will in yours, it's...
-Old?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.559
Ancient.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.119
-Try it.
-Thank you.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.599
-Nothing.
-What about these numbers?

21:33.680 --> 21:36.079
-Go on, let's hear them.
-Coming.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.599
There are three letters first.
"P-G-N"

21:38.680 --> 21:40.799
-Okay.
-Zero, three.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.160
Four, two, zero.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.640
It could be anything.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.559
A Vietnamese restaurant...

21:49.640 --> 21:52.319
The cell phone
of a university student...

21:52.400 --> 21:54.359
Hey, come over here because...

21:57.519 --> 22:00.920
The church is Isabelline Gothic.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
I know this kind of things...

22:04.079 --> 22:07.519
PROTOCOL 5 ENABLED

22:07.599 --> 22:11.519
-What the fuck?
-What do we have?

22:11.599 --> 22:16.000
I don't know. Code 5 alarm went off.
Someone searched the numeric code.

22:16.079 --> 22:18.799
-Do we have the location?
-No but we have an IP.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.599
Track it and find the address.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.160
Look at the corbels.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.839
-The what?
-The corbels.

22:28.559 --> 22:32.359
San Antonio del Río,
like I said. Isabelline Gothic.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.119
In the town
of Pinar de San Antonio.

22:36.599 --> 22:38.279
I wanted to study Art History.

22:38.359 --> 22:41.839
But since that's not employable,
I studied Journalism. Lucky me.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.400
Okay, Pinar de San Antonio.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.599
I'll go and ask if
they know anything about this guy...

22:47.680 --> 22:49.519
Where am I going to get a car?

22:53.400 --> 22:57.599
Come on in. Come on in...

22:57.680 --> 23:01.400
You know that today is the day
for everyone to be here...

23:19.720 --> 23:21.200
Hi. Tell me.

23:21.279 --> 23:24.720
<i>Hi Dad. Listen...</i>
<i>I need to ask you for a favor.</i>

23:24.799 --> 23:26.680
Are you okay? Is anything wrong?

23:26.759 --> 23:31.079
<i>I'm fine. Are you at work?</i>
<i>Can I stop by?</i>

23:31.160 --> 23:33.960
Well, sweetheart, I'm pretty busy.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.079
But we could meet at lunch time.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.839
<i>Brilliant.</i>

23:37.920 --> 23:40.480
Remember, it's Friday.

23:40.559 --> 23:42.960
Oh, that's right.
Will you be there by noon?

23:43.039 --> 23:44.440
Sure.

23:44.519 --> 23:47.000
Great! I will meet you there then.

23:47.079 --> 23:48.599
I'm leaving.

23:49.640 --> 23:53.519
-Fuck, what happened?
-It has disconnected.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.119
Should we warn him, then?

23:56.440 --> 23:58.480
What time is it in Colombia?

24:01.160 --> 24:05.279
SANTA BRÍGIDA, COLOMBIA

24:21.880 --> 24:24.519
Understood? Understood?

24:33.839 --> 24:37.960
Call Quintero. Have him
make the payment. The village is his.

24:38.039 --> 24:41.200
Die, you demon! Die!

25:14.119 --> 25:17.920
Hi? Is it confirmed? Okay.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.480
Send some men after them.

25:20.559 --> 25:23.319
Find out their identity.
Do not lose them.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.319
We will need them for questioning.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.559
We're going back to Madrid.

26:08.359 --> 26:11.319
-Dad?
-It's you.

26:11.400 --> 26:15.559
-Shall I leave you alone for a while?
-No need. Thank you.

26:24.519 --> 26:26.839
What...? What do you tell her?

26:28.079 --> 26:33.039
Silly things. That I sleep badly,
that my bones hurt...

26:34.160 --> 26:35.960
That I'm growing old without her.

26:38.839 --> 26:42.200
-She was beautiful, wasn't she?
-She was.

26:42.279 --> 26:45.519
A neighbor made the dress for her.

26:45.599 --> 26:48.640
-It's still in the attic.
-Seriously?

26:49.839 --> 26:52.119
Of course, my dear.
For when you get married.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.799
Dad, I have to tell you something.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.960
-Well...
-What?

27:02.039 --> 27:05.319
It's just...
Are you using the car this afternoon?

27:19.359 --> 27:22.039
<i>Antonia, the fucking Nazis</i>
<i>have blown up our HQ.</i>

27:22.119 --> 27:25.319
Wait, wait. Riki, are you okay?

27:25.400 --> 27:27.880
<i>Yes, there was no one</i>
<i>when they broke in.</i>

27:27.960 --> 27:30.559
<i>You can't imagine</i>
<i>how bad the place is.</i>

27:30.640 --> 27:33.519
<i>All covered in graffiti,</i>
<i>silicone on locks...</i>

27:33.599 --> 27:35.200
Riki, I'm so sorry.

27:35.279 --> 27:38.279
<i>Things are heating up</i>
<i>with this Bellido thing.</i>

27:38.359 --> 27:41.519
<i>And that bastard Aquilino</i>
<i>is adding fuel to the fire...</i>

27:41.599 --> 27:44.480
-Be careful, okay?
<i>-Where are you?</i>

27:46.400 --> 27:48.279
Let me see.

27:48.359 --> 27:50.319
<i>If you move it, I get dizzy.</i>

27:51.720 --> 27:53.880
<i>Okay, okay. Covering a story.</i>

27:53.960 --> 27:56.519
<i>And how is it going?</i>
<i>Will you get a Pulitzer?</i>

27:58.480 --> 28:00.599
-Shit!
<i>-What's up?</i>

28:00.680 --> 28:02.559
I'm doing a thing for the paper.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.319
I come all the way to the mountains
for a church.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.559
-And it's closed.
<i>-What are you going to do?</i>

28:12.119 --> 28:13.680
Wait!

28:28.920 --> 28:31.079
-A coffee, please? Latte.
-Black?

28:31.160 --> 28:32.839
Coming, sweetheart.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.559
So I came to the world's end
for nothing.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.519
Fucking great!

28:37.599 --> 28:41.240
<i>I don't know. Walk around.</i>
<i>Maybe you find something.</i>

28:41.319 --> 28:44.000
I don't think so.
It's something very old.

28:44.079 --> 28:46.440
It's like... 50 years old?

28:46.519 --> 28:48.640
<i>Someone will help you.</i>

28:48.720 --> 28:51.319
There's nothing left
from that era anymore...

28:53.640 --> 28:58.279
-Wait... Maybe there is.
<i>-See, I told you.</i>

28:58.359 --> 29:01.079
-Riki, I'll call you later. Bye.
<i>-Wait, wait, wait.</i>

29:08.880 --> 29:10.880
SUMMER 1951

29:24.000 --> 29:25.559
Hello, good morning.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.519
Excuse me, could you tell me
if you know this man?

29:28.599 --> 29:32.400
-The one on the center.
-No, dear. He doesn't look familiar.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.680
And you, sir?

29:35.759 --> 29:38.759
Don't bother. He's deaf as a post.

29:43.039 --> 29:44.599
Let's see that photo.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.640
-Come with me. Not here.
-Do you know him?

30:02.720 --> 30:05.920
Are you into stamps?
I have good ones.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.839
History, trains,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.319
Australian fauna, everything...

30:12.400 --> 30:14.680
I have all the ones
from the '92 Expo.

30:14.759 --> 30:17.720
Of Curro, of La Giralda,
of the pavilions...

30:17.799 --> 30:20.200
-Here.
-No. No. Thank you. I'm good.

30:21.839 --> 30:25.680
I'll show them to you later.
Let's have a look at that photo.

30:35.200 --> 30:40.400
Yes, yes. I recognize him perfectly.
It's him.

30:42.119 --> 30:44.119
Excuse me,
do you mind if I take notes?

30:46.960 --> 30:49.680
It was the summer of 1951.

30:49.759 --> 30:51.519
It was a very hot summer.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.920
It was so hot
it felt like raining lava.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.319
<i>My brother Jesús</i>
<i>was imprisoned in a quarry.</i>

31:07.519 --> 31:11.839
<i>Republican prisoners were taken there</i>
<i>to chop stone for The Valley.</i>

31:11.920 --> 31:15.640
Harder! Are you grannies or what?

31:15.720 --> 31:18.519
Come on, commies! Chop those rocks!

31:18.599 --> 31:22.359
Tonight. By the well.
Tell Salvador and Andrés.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.000
You, smartass, move.

31:25.079 --> 31:27.599
<i>He escaped</i>
<i>with three other prisoners.</i>

31:27.680 --> 31:30.720
<i>They were preparing everything</i>
<i>for two weeks.</i>

31:30.799 --> 31:32.359
<i>They nearly got caught.</i>

31:32.440 --> 31:34.319
Shitty commies! Lazy!

31:34.400 --> 31:37.200
<i>But, in the end, they made it.</i>

31:38.319 --> 31:40.960
What a boy Jesús was!

31:41.039 --> 31:45.119
He wouldn't have minded dying
at the front, but there like a dog...

31:46.720 --> 31:48.519
building that monstrosity...

31:50.920 --> 31:54.279
<i>Jesús and I used</i>
<i>to hunt rabbits there.</i>

31:54.359 --> 31:56.920
<i>So they hid in some caves</i>
<i>that we knew.</i>

32:00.240 --> 32:05.279
<i>My mom sent me to bring them food.</i>
<i>I had to get there before nightfall.</i>

32:07.480 --> 32:08.960
<i>But they spotted me.</i>

32:22.920 --> 32:25.519
<i>I thought they were going to kill me</i>
<i>right there.</i>

32:26.920 --> 32:30.440
<i>But then he appeared.</i>

32:46.400 --> 32:47.960
<i>I remember his face.</i>

32:48.920 --> 32:51.039
<i>But I specifically remember this.</i>

32:56.240 --> 32:57.720
Look at the badge.

33:02.559 --> 33:08.160
-What is it? Military?
-No. Something else.

33:09.559 --> 33:11.279
I was petrified.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.319
And so? What did he do to you?

33:37.200 --> 33:41.039
Nothing. He let me go.
He told me to go back to my mom.

33:57.119 --> 33:59.960
And... your brother?
Did you ever see him again?

34:00.039 --> 34:01.319
Never.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.319
I went to my mother
and told her everything.

34:06.400 --> 34:10.800
She hugged me and said,
"You're the man of the house now".

34:10.880 --> 34:13.559
And never mentioned
my brother ever again.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.760
But... why?

34:15.840 --> 34:17.880
Why do you think so, kid?

34:17.960 --> 34:19.679
They killed them right there.

34:19.760 --> 34:24.559
And then, into some ditch
with bag of lime and that was it.

34:24.639 --> 34:28.079
That's horrible.
And did no one look for the bodies?

34:28.159 --> 34:31.440
My mother had already lost one son,
she didn't want to lose two.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.599
There was a lot of retaliation,
a lot of fear.

34:35.679 --> 34:37.199
Those were different times.

34:37.280 --> 34:42.440
And the man that let you go
did you find out who he was?

34:42.519 --> 34:45.639
Only some elders remember
the victims.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.960
But no one wants to remember
the executioners.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.679
Silvia, I think I got something!

34:56.760 --> 35:00.440
I'm trying to reach Verdú, but
he isn't picking up. I'm on my way.

35:01.519 --> 35:03.159
-See ya.
-Let's go.

35:03.239 --> 35:07.760
<i>Don't lose her. Follow her.</i>

35:27.320 --> 35:29.079
Pick up, come on.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.159
What's this guy doing?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.960
Fuck! Fuck!

35:56.760 --> 36:00.599
<i>Verdú, I've barely escaped,</i>
<i>but they've tried to kill me!</i>

36:00.679 --> 36:05.280
-What? Escaped from what?
<i>-From a car, well, a van. I swear.</i>

36:05.360 --> 36:09.320
I am driving, and one
of those dealer vans gets behind me.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.119
I speed up and he speeds up too.

36:12.199 --> 36:14.880
You can't imagine
how hard they hit me.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.639
Right after
I'd been asking about this issue!

36:17.719 --> 36:20.400
-It's fucking crazy!
<i>-Stop! Stop! Stop!</i>

36:20.480 --> 36:22.239
See if I've got this straight.

36:22.320 --> 36:27.039
Someone, we don't know who,
a mysterious hand, sent you a file.

36:27.119 --> 36:28.840
<i>You're investigating a man,</i>

36:28.920 --> 36:31.719
<i>whom you believe was</i>
<i>a murderer 60 years ago.</i>

36:31.800 --> 36:33.199
Exactly!

36:33.280 --> 36:35.880
<i>But you don't know</i>
<i>who he is or his name...</i>

36:35.960 --> 36:37.840
-No...
<i>-And so what do we publish?</i>

36:37.920 --> 36:40.119
<i>The photo of this man</i>
<i>and one of a comb?</i>

36:40.199 --> 36:43.800
Listen! I should go to The Valley,
to the Benedictine abbey.

36:43.880 --> 36:47.960
They must have records
of the prisoners and maybe there...

36:48.039 --> 36:50.239
No. Leave the Benedictine alone.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.199
-Come back and we'll talk.
-What?

36:52.280 --> 36:53.719
<i>So there is a conspiracy</i>

36:53.800 --> 36:55.840
<i>for a story from 60 years ago?</i>

36:55.920 --> 36:58.599
<i>This mess you're telling me</i>
<i>about is interesting,</i>

36:58.679 --> 37:00.280
but I don't see it.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.800
Fine. See you in a bit.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.440
<i>Wait! Do not go in.</i>
<i>Guard the entrance.</i>

37:44.519 --> 37:47.960
<i>Wait till she gets out.</i>
<i>We are sending back up.</i>

38:17.920 --> 38:21.280
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:22.559 --> 38:25.119
It isn't possible
to access the archives.

38:25.199 --> 38:28.639
They are protected until the end
of the digitalization process.

38:28.719 --> 38:31.039
I see.
And how long will that process take?

38:31.119 --> 38:32.800
I've been here waiting...

38:34.400 --> 38:36.159
As long as necessary.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.320
My newspaper is investigating
the identity of a man--

38:40.400 --> 38:43.599
You can send a request
for access to the archives

38:43.679 --> 38:45.119
when they are available.

38:45.199 --> 38:47.159
Let me get this straight... This...

38:47.239 --> 38:49.760
It's prayer time,
and we are about to close.

38:52.599 --> 38:55.199
ARCHIVES
NO TRESPASSING

38:55.280 --> 38:58.559
This way, come on. Everyone this way.

39:05.599 --> 39:12.480
Hey... Careful, careful.
There you go. The wreath.

39:14.039 --> 39:17.440
Hail queen and mother...

39:22.599 --> 39:26.760
Building started in 1940, okay?

39:26.840 --> 39:29.599
In commemoration
of those who fell in the Civil...

39:31.800 --> 39:33.239
War...

39:33.320 --> 39:37.079
The construction ended in 1958.

39:37.159 --> 39:41.880
It was built by Republican prisoners,
who were sentenced to forced labor.

39:41.960 --> 39:45.679
Many died here because
of the poor conditions...

39:45.760 --> 39:48.800
-Do you hear what she is saying?
-Yes, dear, yes.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.960
That's how they indoctrinate
the people in the schools,

39:52.039 --> 39:54.480
so they hate Spain.

39:54.559 --> 39:58.039
They have no shame coming here
to insult the memory of Franco...

39:58.119 --> 39:59.760
That's what I say!

39:59.840 --> 40:02.800
And thanks to him
there was peace and order.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.280
And people were safe!

40:04.360 --> 40:06.840
Now a junkie can rob you
on any corner.

40:06.920 --> 40:10.280
They complain a lot, but thanks
to Franco we have democracy!

40:10.360 --> 40:12.000
Say it loud and clear!

40:12.079 --> 40:15.320
I'm saying that thanks to Franco
we have democracy!

40:15.400 --> 40:19.039
-Outrageous!
-What? Don't you like democracy?

40:19.119 --> 40:23.239
-Communist! Lesbian!
-Fucking fascist!

40:23.320 --> 40:24.960
Me, a fascist?

40:25.039 --> 40:27.840
Leave me! Let me beat him up!

40:27.920 --> 40:31.239
Come on, let them hear us!
Loud and clear!

41:24.480 --> 41:25.760
Excuse me, Madam.

41:27.039 --> 41:28.960
Enough! That's enough!

42:48.239 --> 42:50.000
5, 51...

42:52.880 --> 42:55.639
Jesus... shit!

43:03.960 --> 43:05.199
Target nearby.

43:08.079 --> 43:10.480
<i>There is an intruder!</i>
<i>I repeat, an intruder!</i>

43:10.559 --> 43:13.360
<i>Catch her alive.</i>
<i>Don't let her leave the grounds.</i>

43:13.440 --> 43:14.840
Fuck it!

43:14.920 --> 43:17.400
Hey you, freeze!

43:17.480 --> 43:19.800
What are you doing? Don't move!

43:19.880 --> 43:22.719
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

43:26.960 --> 43:28.320
Stop right there!

43:30.280 --> 43:32.239
No, no, no--

43:32.320 --> 43:36.159
Open the door! I said open it!

43:42.039 --> 43:44.079
Fuck!

43:52.880 --> 43:54.519
<i>Let's go! This way!</i>

44:00.079 --> 44:03.239
-What the fuck?
-<i>She escaped through the window.</i>

44:03.320 --> 44:05.159
Let's go!

44:07.599 --> 44:09.320
Don't let her escape!

44:30.679 --> 44:32.960
Over there, over there! We have her!

44:46.920 --> 44:49.199
Stop or I shoot!

44:55.840 --> 44:57.920
<i>Don't shoot!</i>
<i>The boss wants her alive.</i>

45:11.320 --> 45:14.960
-Don't move!
-Freeze! Don't move!

45:15.039 --> 45:17.239
Don't move!

45:17.760 --> 45:19.079
Fuck!

45:22.039 --> 45:24.480
What are you doing?
I told you not to move!

45:26.400 --> 45:29.880
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
Don't do it! Don't do it!

45:29.960 --> 45:31.559
Stop!

45:55.679 --> 45:57.320
Go after her! Now!

45:59.599 --> 46:01.320
Fuck!

46:06.480 --> 46:08.880
Enough! I want her alive!

46:11.559 --> 46:13.400
Bring the boat! Move!

46:23.920 --> 46:26.840
Stop!
She's entered the cave.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.079
-Hello?
-She's here!

46:52.159 --> 46:53.440
Fuck!

46:55.000 --> 46:57.440
<i>Come on! She's here!</i>

49:32.360 --> 49:34.760

50:51.079 --> 50:53.039
-Let go of me!
-Boy!

50:53.119 --> 50:56.920
You've got 30 seconds
to explain what's happening here.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.440
-Please, I can't breathe.
-20 seconds.

51:20.239 --> 51:23.480

SECRET SERVICE SPAIN

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
Where did you get this? Answer me!

51:30.079 --> 51:32.920
Someone mailed it to me!
I don't know who sent it!

51:33.000 --> 51:35.119
-Who do you work for?
-A newspaper.

51:35.199 --> 51:37.280
"Crónica 24". Call and verify it.

51:37.360 --> 51:40.159
-What is "Crónica 24"?
-A newspaper.

51:40.239 --> 51:42.599
On paper, but we'll move to digital--

51:42.679 --> 51:44.639
Are you trying to confuse me?

51:44.719 --> 51:48.119
No! I swear I'm not!
When I got the envelope, I thought...

51:48.199 --> 51:51.079
that maybe there was a story,

51:51.159 --> 51:54.599
like "the day I received
a mysterious envelope".

51:54.679 --> 51:57.599
When I started looking,
some guys started chasing me.

51:57.679 --> 51:59.719
They didn't want me to find you.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.480
Who were those men?

52:01.559 --> 52:05.119
They were dressed in black,
and their faces were covered.

52:06.320 --> 52:09.920
-Don't hurt me please!
-I'm not going to hurt you.

52:11.159 --> 52:14.360
Trust me, boy.
I'm one of the good ones.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.599
And I'm not a boy.
My name is Antonia.

52:24.679 --> 52:28.320
And... you... Well...
And you're naked.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.280
-I'm sorry...
-You can stay like that.

52:31.360 --> 52:35.119
But if you prefer to get dressed,
there are clothes in that wardrobe.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.159
<i>Don't let her run away!</i>

52:51.800 --> 52:53.519
What is this place?

52:53.599 --> 52:56.639
If you don't know,
and you were in there...

52:56.719 --> 52:59.920
Shit, you have no idea
about the fucking day I've had.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.360
And there's no phone coverage.
Fuck my life!

53:08.880 --> 53:10.559
Are you sure you're not a boy?

53:10.639 --> 53:13.199
-She's around here!
-Shit!

53:13.280 --> 53:15.519
It's them.
We've got to close the door, now!

53:29.199 --> 53:31.559
No, no! Fuck!

53:36.280 --> 53:37.519
Here!

53:38.920 --> 53:40.400
No! Fuck!

53:42.079 --> 53:44.119
-Yes!
-Let's go! Let's go!

53:50.280 --> 53:53.840
Are you ready?
We've got to get out of here now.

53:54.840 --> 53:57.400
By the way, who are you?
This is insane...

53:57.480 --> 54:01.280
I've been looking for you all day,
well, for your body, or a grave.

54:01.360 --> 54:05.239
And I find you and you're alive
and I don't even know your name.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.239
My name...

54:10.760 --> 54:12.400
I'm--

54:20.280 --> 54:22.039
Quick! Quick!

54:25.079 --> 54:26.800
On your 12. Come on! Quick!

54:28.679 --> 54:32.039
Here! Here! Here!
Securing the target.

54:33.440 --> 54:37.559
-Let me go! Let me go you beast!
-Gentlemen...

54:37.639 --> 54:40.920
Could you please leave
the lady alone?

54:41.000 --> 54:42.760
-Freeze!
-Behind you!

54:50.480 --> 54:54.679
-Careful!
-Drop the gun!

54:54.760 --> 54:58.519
-Calm down. I won't shoot you.
-What?

54:58.599 --> 55:01.440
Back off or I'll kill her.
Surrender.

55:01.519 --> 55:04.199
You filthy bastard!
You're touching my boob.

55:04.280 --> 55:08.400
That's not true.
You don't stop moving. Mother fucker!

55:22.559 --> 55:24.159
Antonia, run!

55:26.360 --> 55:27.880
Now!

57:58.039 --> 58:01.920
