<i>You are different,</i>

00:11.839 --> 00:18.760
<i>Different from others,</i>

00:25.559 --> 00:30.280
<i>You are different, so different</i>

00:30.359 --> 00:36.640
<i>Different from anybody I've ever met</i>

00:36.719 --> 00:41.039
<i>You are different, so different</i>

00:41.119 --> 00:47.399
<i>that I definitely fell in love</i>

00:47.479 --> 00:52.520
<i>You are different, so different</i>

00:52.600 --> 00:58.920
<i>Different from anybody I've ever met</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:01.960
<i>You are different, so different</i>

01:02.039 --> 01:07.120
Feli, look. Look who it is.

01:09.799 --> 01:13.599
-Go. Come on. I'll finish Mrs. Elena.
-Thank you.

01:15.760 --> 01:21.480
<i>...that's why I definitely fell</i>
<i>in love with you as we met ...</i>

01:21.560 --> 01:24.120
<i>You are different</i>

01:24.200 --> 01:26.359
-Hi.
-Hello.

01:26.439 --> 01:30.840
Stop, you're crazy. You're going
to tear my stockings! Put me down!

01:30.920 --> 01:32.680
If you give me a kiss.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.840
-You look really gorgeous.
-Don't be silly.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.719
Just my work clothes.

01:44.799 --> 01:48.159
But you'll see the dress
my cousin has lent me for tonight.

01:48.239 --> 01:50.200
She can't come to the fair.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.280
She has a big cold, poor her.

01:54.359 --> 01:56.280
I'm going to buy her some doughnuts.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.079
I do need a light coat...

02:02.200 --> 02:05.760
-Newspaper, sir?
-No, thank you.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.680
It's a special edition, sir.

02:11.719 --> 02:13.680
Okay. Now move.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.719
-I have to go. I'm sorry.
-Again?

02:18.800 --> 02:22.560
Fine, go. I'll find someone
to take me out to dance.

02:22.639 --> 02:27.879
Wait for me. I'll be back, I promise.
I'll be late but I'll be there.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.039
-Please.
-Go on, go.

02:37.879 --> 02:39.240
Taxi!

03:44.520 --> 03:47.400
I had to jump right into
the fucking water...

03:47.479 --> 03:50.439
from a height that was three,
four, five floors.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.680
I got to another place
that was a cave that led

03:53.759 --> 03:56.319
to a tunnel, that lead
to another tunnel...

03:56.400 --> 03:59.039
I arrived
to fucking a secret laboratory.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.919
Right there! Underneath everything.
I find a cryogenically frozen guy.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.080
Obviously, after everything,
there was an explosion...

04:06.159 --> 04:07.919
and I had to run for my life.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.680
Obviously I couldn't stay there.

04:09.759 --> 04:11.879
Just imagine I do and more men
in black keep on coming and...

04:13.719 --> 04:15.680
Thank you.

04:15.759 --> 04:19.680
Thanks. I'm still shaking.
If you knew how scared I was.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.920
-It was unbelievable, it was...
-Tremendous, tremendous.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.920
I'm going back to bed,
I start working in two hours.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.680
Good night.

04:31.439 --> 04:35.079
Honey, I'm going back to bed too,
okay?

04:35.160 --> 04:38.240
Dry your hair, go on,
you'll freeze to death.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.279
You do, right?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.920
-Riki, tell me you believe me.
-I do. I do.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.920
Antonia, it's a really strange story.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.680
Okay. Look! I have proof.
Where is it? Fuck! Here.

04:59.759 --> 05:02.240
This was the man!

05:02.319 --> 05:04.680
You can barely see him,
but... it was him.

05:04.759 --> 05:06.279
Fuck, Riki!

05:08.800 --> 05:10.439
This man! I have proof!

05:10.519 --> 05:13.360
I have the photo
on my phone, this photo.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.879
And a dent in the car,
when they followed me,

05:15.959 --> 05:17.959
and this bump. This one.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.120
It's from the explosion.
What else do you need, dude?

05:21.199 --> 05:23.279
Alright, kiddo, all right, calm down.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.120
-Don't call me kiddo.
-Okay.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.319
And I am calm, very calm.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.399
<i>...since we received the news</i>
<i>about the Captain's kidnapping.</i>

05:32.480 --> 05:34.480
<i>Catalina Bellido, the Captain,</i>

05:34.560 --> 05:37.399
<i>is a candidate for the presidency</i>
<i>of our country.</i>

05:37.480 --> 05:40.560
<i>What is the government</i>
<i>doing to solve this crisis?</i>

05:40.639 --> 05:42.079
Antonia!

05:42.160 --> 05:44.680
Dad, I'm sorry, forgive me.
I was with Fanny,

05:44.759 --> 05:46.920
my phone had no battery and...

05:47.000 --> 05:50.839
That T-shirt isn't yours.
Did you spend the night with a boy?

05:52.279 --> 05:54.319
With a girl, then.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.959
-No, no, no, Dad. What...?
-Today it's normal...

05:59.040 --> 06:02.399
No, no! I haven't slept with a girl!
Or with a boy!

06:02.480 --> 06:05.680
What happened is that...
I crashed the car.

06:05.759 --> 06:09.040
-You crashed it?
-It's all right, it's just a dent.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.240
I'll take it to the repair shop.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.439
Leave the car,
I'm worried about you!

06:13.519 --> 06:16.519
Are you all right?
Why didn't you call me?

06:16.600 --> 06:19.800
Because I knew you'd tell me off
and you'd panic!

06:19.879 --> 06:21.319
Of course I got scared!

06:21.399 --> 06:24.800
I spent the night thinking
what could have happened to you?

06:24.879 --> 06:26.279
I'm not angry.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.720
Don't scare me like this,
I'm too old for this.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.519
I'm sorry.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.600
Do you want some breakfast?

06:39.279 --> 06:43.480
No. I'm going to sleep for a bit,
I'm knackered, okay?

06:43.560 --> 06:45.000
Okay...

07:58.160 --> 07:59.639
Excuse me, could you--

07:59.720 --> 08:02.319
Dude, it's been canceled
because of the Captain.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.160
-May I get past?
-Yes...

08:16.240 --> 08:18.959
Could you tell me
where can I acquire a ticket?

08:19.040 --> 08:21.920
-You don't have a card?
-No.

08:25.079 --> 08:26.680
Like this.

08:26.759 --> 08:28.920
Walk through.
Or we'll be here all day.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.120
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

08:46.799 --> 08:48.919
May I sit please?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.840
-Excuse me, what?
-May sit down, please?

08:51.919 --> 08:54.440
-I can't hear anything.
-What are you saying?

08:54.519 --> 08:56.159
May I sit down please?

08:58.960 --> 09:01.840
Young man,
the lady needs to sit down.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.440
What the heck are you saying?
Fuck off.

09:06.519 --> 09:08.559
Didn't you hear me?

09:12.559 --> 09:14.120
I told you to get up.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.360
And turn off that transistor.
You're annoying everyone.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.639
Sit still.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.399
You, pick that rubbish up
from the floor.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.679
And you, be kind enough
to give this lady your seat.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.000
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Bravo!

11:14.440 --> 11:15.879
Excuse me!

11:15.960 --> 11:18.360
What happened
to the ladies' hair salon?

11:18.440 --> 11:20.919
-Ladies?
-It was run by two women.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.200
Trust me,
no woman ever goes in there.

11:23.279 --> 11:26.039
Just guys trimming their beards.
It's trendy.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.200
Shaved heads
and beards down to their chest...

11:29.279 --> 11:30.639
I see...

11:34.080 --> 11:35.759
Excuse me, boy...

12:05.799 --> 12:07.919
-Sir.
-What do we know about her?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.440
Not much to be fair.

12:09.519 --> 12:12.759
When she typed the code,
we got her IP address.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.799
We are tracking her
but there is barely anything.

12:15.879 --> 12:18.600
Her name is Antonia
and she's 23 years old.

12:20.919 --> 12:22.320
Has she gone online?

12:22.399 --> 12:24.759
Not since we followed her
to the valley.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.799
-What went on there?
-We don't know.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.600
-You don't know?
-No.

12:28.679 --> 12:31.960
There was an explosion,
we don't know if it was accidental.

12:32.039 --> 12:35.279
They went underground,
and we lost communication.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.799
-Casualties?
-Four of our men.

12:40.399 --> 12:42.120
Unacceptable.

12:42.200 --> 12:46.039
Four dead men and the girl is free.
How is it possible?

12:46.120 --> 12:49.039
-We don't know.
-You don't know.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.879
I'll take charge from now.
We can't lose her again.

12:51.960 --> 12:55.960
Sir, what is protocol five?
What are we looking for?

12:56.039 --> 12:58.240
If we knew more...

13:56.960 --> 14:00.399
To talk about this issue we have here
the Home Office Minister,

14:00.480 --> 14:01.879
Gabriel Hernando

14:01.960 --> 14:03.600
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

14:03.679 --> 14:05.879
And Pablo Rodero,
Left Wing Union leader

14:05.960 --> 14:07.480
and candidate to Presidency

14:07.559 --> 14:10.159
<i>-Good morning...</i>
<i>-We also have Manuel Osorio...</i>

14:10.240 --> 14:12.840
-Did you go?
-Silvia, I can't right now...

14:12.919 --> 14:14.399
Just hold on a sec, okay?

14:16.720 --> 14:19.279
I called the dam of the Valley
asking about the explosion

14:19.360 --> 14:22.039
and they told me
it was due to a gas leak.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.279
This is really big, VerdÃº.
Really big.

14:27.799 --> 14:29.919
-What?
-Have you gone crazy?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.600
Another one! I'm not crazy!
It's all true.

14:32.679 --> 14:35.000
There's a dude who should be dead,
but he is alive,

14:35.080 --> 14:37.320
-Because he was...
-Antonia, enough!

14:38.399 --> 14:41.200
-How can you do this to me?
-Excuse me?

14:41.279 --> 14:45.639
This morning the big bosses asked me
if we were keeping you or Pablo.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.200
And you said...

14:47.279 --> 14:50.440
-It doesn't matter anymore.
-But look, think.

14:50.519 --> 14:53.960
-Why would I invent this?
-What would I know!

14:54.039 --> 14:57.000
Because you wanted
to bring in a big story and...

14:57.080 --> 14:59.120
I have no idea, Antonia.
You know why.

15:00.960 --> 15:05.399
Collect your things.
You don't need to come on Monday.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.799
-What are you thinking?
-I don't know what to say...

15:12.960 --> 15:14.720
Are you okay?

15:16.840 --> 15:19.559
-Fuck.
-It's your boyfriend?

15:19.639 --> 15:21.399
-Answer it.
-No, what for?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.159
He doesn't believe me either.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.840
Well, Antonia...
what you are saying...

15:26.919 --> 15:28.919
It's really hard to believe.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Lots of unbelievable things
happen in the world. Lots.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.519
I know, I know.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.039
I listen to
"The Threshold of the Unknown".

15:36.120 --> 15:40.240
Even they don't say the crazy things
you just told me.

15:43.799 --> 15:46.159
-I've got to go, sweetie...
-You're right.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.879
I have to go to there.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.399
They'll listen to me.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.480
But they believe in reptilians there,
Antonia.

15:52.559 --> 15:55.320
And what do we know?
Maybe they do exist!

15:55.399 --> 15:58.399
Well, yeah...
But probably they don't.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.080
<i>A new mystery...</i>

16:00.159 --> 16:03.559
She's just started. If I run,
I'll get her before she finishes.

16:04.799 --> 16:07.759
-Are you coming?
-No... No.

16:07.840 --> 16:12.159
-I'll see you later. Bye.
-Antonia, don't... Don't...

16:24.879 --> 16:28.679
Wait! Wait! Thank you!

16:34.240 --> 16:37.919
Up or down? Okay.

16:49.159 --> 16:52.240
At the reception desk
they sent me to the guest room.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.879
Follow me.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.519
Great, I'm coming to
"The Threshold of the Unknown"

16:56.600 --> 16:59.039
because I have a weird story
that happened...

16:59.120 --> 17:00.960
Wait there.
They'll come shortly.

17:01.039 --> 17:04.240
Nobody speaks clearly about
our Captain kidnapping but

17:04.319 --> 17:08.079
I'm telling you what the government
doesn't want you to know!

17:08.160 --> 17:09.680
Cut, cut.

17:09.759 --> 17:12.359
-Aquilino, let's start again.
-No.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.160
This text is crap.
No one could pull it off.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.079
-I'm going to get a coffee.
-As you wish, Aquilino.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.519
Excuse me?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.039
It's you...

17:33.319 --> 17:34.920
It's you.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.400
Excuse me, you're Aquilino, right?

17:38.480 --> 17:40.680
-Do I know you?
-No, no.

17:40.759 --> 17:44.359
My father listens to your program.
And I have a story to tell you.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.000
-It's a very strange thing.
-Yeah, I bet.

17:47.079 --> 17:51.160
Call the production hotline
and they'll let you know what to do.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.839
God, this man is so rude.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.680
Listen! Someone's trying to kill me
to stop me opening my mouth.

17:57.759 --> 17:59.960
I don't know if it's the government.

18:00.039 --> 18:02.079
I'm investigating this man.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.799
I found him in a sort of
secret laboratory under the Valley.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.720
I know how it sounds,
but it's true.

18:07.799 --> 18:10.319
There was an explosion,
they attacked us and...

18:15.880 --> 18:18.319
Do you know what that insignia means?

18:20.839 --> 18:22.079
No.

18:25.519 --> 18:27.960
-And Riki don't believe me.
-Riki? Who's Riki?

18:28.039 --> 18:29.440
It doesn't matter.

18:29.519 --> 18:32.480
I told them at my newspaper
but they didn't believe me.

18:32.559 --> 18:35.079
Well, I believe you.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.799
What are we doing here?

18:37.880 --> 18:43.039
Six years ago they said
they'd digitize the archive and look.

18:43.119 --> 18:44.559
Look what it's like.

18:52.640 --> 18:56.200
23-F, the BÃ©lmez Faces...

19:01.519 --> 19:04.640
-Here it is!
-Section Nine?

19:04.720 --> 19:09.559
Section Nine was created
in 1939, when the war ended,

19:09.640 --> 19:12.039
as Franco's secret police.

19:12.119 --> 19:18.279
They did what the police and army
couldn't do with the world watching.

19:18.359 --> 19:20.119
What about the guy in the photo?

19:20.200 --> 19:23.000
Shut up for a second,
we're getting to that.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.720
Okay. You don't have to be so rude.

19:29.480 --> 19:35.880
-Franco. Do you know who he was?
-Yes.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.920
Franco was obsessed
with the idea of immortality.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.200
At the end of WWII, the Americans
began the Paper Clip operation.

19:45.279 --> 19:49.440
They took German's best scientists
to USA.

19:49.519 --> 19:53.480
To create weapons, ships...
well, anything.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.720
Franco couldn't be left behind,

19:55.799 --> 20:00.680
so he brought Professor Neffenberg
to Spain in 1945.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.920
This guy looks crazy.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.759
This crazy guy created the formula
to create a super-agent.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.599
The secret agent among secret agents.

20:17.680 --> 20:22.039
Capable of doing things
that no one else was able to do.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.200
May I?

20:33.480 --> 20:38.799
So the guy I found in the crypt
is a super-agent

20:38.880 --> 20:42.599
created by a Nazi scientist

20:42.680 --> 20:46.559
who worked
for a Francoist secret agency.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.680
My boss is going to freak out.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.599
He didn't believe me before,
he won't now.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.920
I'm telling you the truth.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.279
But there's no proof
of the super-soldier

21:00.359 --> 21:03.079
or the Nazi guy, right?

21:03.160 --> 21:06.960
They both disappeared 60 years ago.

21:07.039 --> 21:09.559
But you saw one of them last night.

21:11.079 --> 21:13.359
You are right, I have no proof,

21:15.920 --> 21:19.920
but there's someone
who might be able to help you...

21:23.599 --> 21:28.200
Babe! How much do I owe you?
We're leaving.

21:28.279 --> 21:32.160
-Are we leaving? And your friend?
-He listened to my message.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.960
We've been here for an hour.

21:34.039 --> 21:36.480
If he is not already here,
he is not coming.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.000
He is a bit peculiar.

21:42.680 --> 21:46.319
-What do you mean peculiar?
-An alcoholic, a cocaine addict...

21:47.640 --> 21:49.559
And he also hit the slot machines.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.119
But he was in Section Nine.

21:54.200 --> 21:58.400
-And where is he now?
-All I know is he usually comes here.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.319
So, good luck, sweetie.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.599
<i>I've been calling you</i>
<i>and you didn't answer.</i>

22:24.680 --> 22:26.759
<i>You'll never guess who showed up,</i>

22:26.839 --> 22:29.640
<i>I gave him your address.</i>
<i>I don't know if I did right</i>

22:29.720 --> 22:31.400
<i>-but he's so attractive.</i>
-Fuck!

22:31.480 --> 22:34.000
Calm down, calm down.
Don't shout, please.

22:39.839 --> 22:42.000
I'm sorry to show up like this but...

22:43.599 --> 22:45.720
I don't know anyone else in Madrid.

22:47.039 --> 22:48.279
But...

22:59.880 --> 23:01.119
Wait!

23:05.480 --> 23:06.759
Come on.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.599
-How many people live here?
-Just me, it's my room.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.759
I tidy it up on Saturdays, okay?

23:21.119 --> 23:22.720
I'm still tripping!

23:22.799 --> 23:25.799
This is something.
It's all real, I didn't invent it.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.319
-There was an explosion, right?
-Yes.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.680
-And those men in black died!
-Yes.

23:30.759 --> 23:34.279
And you were saved because
you're a... super-soldier.

23:34.359 --> 23:38.000
-Is that what you call it?
-Well, a secret agent or something.

23:38.079 --> 23:42.160
And you work for Section Nine!
Well, you used to. 60 years ago.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.839
My mind is blowing.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.920
And what's your name?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.480
I don't even know your name.

23:48.559 --> 23:51.680
-You may call me GarcÃ­a.
-GarcÃ­a. GarcÃ­a? Okay.

23:51.759 --> 23:54.319
Is that your alias or your...
secret identity?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.119
Whatever... I'm Antonia.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.319
Great, GarcÃ­a. GarcÃ­a...

23:59.400 --> 24:01.720
And how did you end up
in that capsule?

24:01.799 --> 24:04.279
Were you asleep or frozen or what?

24:04.359 --> 24:07.039
Did someone put you in?

24:07.119 --> 24:11.200
-I don't know. I don't remember.
-I was hoping you'd tell me.

24:11.279 --> 24:15.319
I told you everything I know.
I was investigating on the envelope.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.640
At the newspaper
they didn't believe me.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.839
I see...

24:19.920 --> 24:23.079
You have to come with me,
VerdÃº is going to freak out!

24:24.200 --> 24:25.599
No, no newspapers.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.200
-Your story is a knockout.
-I said no.

24:28.279 --> 24:31.640
Don't talk to me like that.
On top of getting you out of that...

24:32.480 --> 24:34.079
Darling?

24:34.160 --> 24:38.480
Fuck! My father! Go hide!
To the wardrobe. Quick!

24:44.240 --> 24:45.640
-Darling.
-Yes.

24:45.720 --> 24:49.440
-Are you going to bed already?
-Yes, almost! Today I'm knackered.

24:49.519 --> 24:54.880
-Your room is such a mess.
-I'll tide it up on Saturday.

24:56.119 --> 25:00.079
-Go to bed. You look tired.
-Yes.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.880
-Good night.
-Bye.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.400
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'll leave.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.000
I must find Section Nine.

25:11.079 --> 25:13.960
I'll go with you.
I know, no newspapers.

25:14.039 --> 25:16.319
But you need me.
Do you have any money?

25:16.400 --> 25:19.039
-No.
-Do you have a car?

25:19.119 --> 25:20.519
-No.
-Well, that's that.

25:20.599 --> 25:23.240
-Sleep here.
-Here?

25:23.319 --> 25:27.680
Well not here in my bed but...
you could use the sofa.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.720
On the floor?

25:31.319 --> 25:32.720
You have options.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.319
It doesn't matter.
I don't sleep much.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.839
Well, in that crypt
you had a 60-year nap.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.160
I don't think I'll sleep much either.

25:50.039 --> 25:52.039
I've had two unbelievable days.

25:52.119 --> 25:56.000
Yesterday, I was shot at,
I jumped off a bridge...

25:56.079 --> 25:59.599
Today, I was told I was insane,
and I got fired...

26:04.400 --> 26:06.599
And wait until my father finds out...

26:10.279 --> 26:12.039
Listen...

26:23.480 --> 26:25.799
Thank you for helping me.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.880
One for screen two, please.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.759
<i>You said so yourself.</i>

27:15.960 --> 27:19.960
<i>Who could be the one</i>
<i>to witness peace in Spain.</i>

27:20.039 --> 27:23.440
<i>You will, you will.</i>
<i>No one can stop you.</i>

27:23.519 --> 27:26.039
<i>We will throw Ben Yusuf's hosts</i>
<i>to the sea.</i>

27:27.960 --> 27:29.519
<i>I haven't failed.</i>

27:30.759 --> 27:33.640
<i>Spain has a king.</i>

27:34.519 --> 27:38.880
<i>My king must not kneel before no one.</i>

27:38.960 --> 27:42.799
<i>Tomorrow we will fight together</i>

27:43.920 --> 27:45.720
<i>my king and I.</i>

27:45.799 --> 27:48.160
<i>The two of us together.</i>

28:05.440 --> 28:08.680
How are you, Sanz? Tamargo.

28:08.759 --> 28:11.799
-Password.
-Obsidian. Z-33.

28:45.559 --> 28:47.920
Hello? He's just arrived.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.799
-Agent GarcÃ­a.
-Congratulations.

29:12.559 --> 29:14.960
Mari Luz, Amalia, ConcepciÃ³n.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.519
-Good evening, Margarita.
-Good evening, Mr. GarcÃ­a.

29:26.599 --> 29:30.400
They're still in a meeting,
but they'll call you in a moment.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.920
Ok, thank you.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.160
Mr. GarcÃ­a! Mr. GarcÃ­a!

29:37.480 --> 29:38.720
Do you have a moment?

29:43.079 --> 29:46.759
-Since when do you smoke, Chencho?
-I don't smoke.

29:51.279 --> 29:53.400
<i>One, two.</i>

29:53.480 --> 29:55.759
<i>One, two. Do you hear me?</i>

30:00.519 --> 30:03.160
-Loud and clear.
<i>-Perfect.</i>

30:03.240 --> 30:06.119
-A radio?
-A communicator.

30:06.200 --> 30:10.000
Resistant to being hit,
heat, cold, and water.

30:10.079 --> 30:11.920
Just like you.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.359
Better than sending kids
with newspapers.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.920
Good work.

30:18.039 --> 30:23.359
<i>Agents GarcÃ­a and Ortiz,</i>
<i>report to the meeting room.</i>

30:33.400 --> 30:36.799
-Gentlemen...
-Excuse me. One second, please.

30:41.759 --> 30:43.000
You may continue.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.079
Agents GarcÃ­a and Ortiz,
you have a mission.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.039
Professor Neffenberg has disappeared.

30:51.119 --> 30:53.400
After cooperating
with the Spanish government,

30:53.480 --> 30:56.160
instead of turning himself in

30:56.240 --> 30:58.720
and give access to Section Nine,

30:58.799 --> 31:03.559
the Professor has taken his files,
reports, gadgets...

31:05.079 --> 31:08.480
We sent six men
to stop him at his lab.

31:08.559 --> 31:10.359
All six are dead.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.960
-Chencho, for the love of God.
-Sorry.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.200
Neffenberg didn't have time
to run away.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.880
But he will.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.960
We believe
he is still in Spanish territory.

31:25.039 --> 31:27.440
Your mission is
to detain the professor

31:27.519 --> 31:30.680
and hand him over
to the North American embassy.

31:30.759 --> 31:32.039
Good luck.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.720
-Gentlemen...
-Agent GarcÃ¬a, good luck.

31:46.799 --> 31:50.759
-He's a little off today, isn't he?
-What would you know?

32:05.519 --> 32:06.960
What's wrong?

32:09.240 --> 32:11.799
Is it the mission? Neffenberg?

32:11.880 --> 32:15.119
When the war ended
I wanted to keep serving my country.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.680
Neffenberg gave me the tools
to do that,

32:18.759 --> 32:21.759
but he didn't make me what I am.
I owe him nothing.

32:21.839 --> 32:25.440
He betrayed us. We will capture him
and he'll pay for his crimes.

32:25.519 --> 32:28.559
GarcÃ­a and Ortiz, always vigilant.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.880
Sure.

32:36.559 --> 32:40.039
It's Friday. Where do you think
all those people are going?

32:42.039 --> 32:43.319
Home, I guess.

32:44.480 --> 32:48.240
To have dinner with their families,
or to the fair...

32:49.319 --> 32:51.880
What about you?
What are you going to do?

32:53.039 --> 32:55.480
I'll go to the firing range
for a while.

33:00.039 --> 33:01.599
What's wrong, Mr. GarcÃ­a?

33:03.160 --> 33:05.640
Nothing.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.519
They don't know it

33:07.599 --> 33:11.039
but while GarcÃ­a and Ortiz exist,
they can sleep peacefully!

33:26.440 --> 33:27.960
Get up!

33:29.920 --> 33:31.400
Coming.

33:34.079 --> 33:37.480
Your dad already left,
I heard the door an hour ago.

33:38.319 --> 33:39.720
An hour?

33:39.799 --> 33:43.640
-How long have you been up?
-I don't sleep much, I told you.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.279
-And we have work to do.
-Work?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.440
A mission.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.440
Breakfast.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.240
Cardamom muffin
and a flat white, please.

34:01.799 --> 34:03.039
Great.

34:06.119 --> 34:11.000
-A coffee with milk.
-Soy, oat, rice?

34:13.000 --> 34:16.840
-Just a coffee with milk.
-Cow's milk.

34:18.559 --> 34:19.800
Thank you.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.280
Well, where do we start out?

34:24.360 --> 34:27.519
First, we find out
if anyone from Section Nine is left.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.280
Their identities were secret.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.760
But there are a few names I know.

34:32.840 --> 34:37.199
Chencho GutiÃ©rrez, Miguel Ridruejo
and, maybe, Pablo Aramendi.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.000
We'll go to the Register.

34:39.079 --> 34:41.280
If access is limited,

34:41.360 --> 34:44.079
we'll investigate
in the National Archive.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.599
-It'll be hours but...
-Quiet.

34:46.519 --> 34:47.760
Sorry.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.519
Thank you.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.840
What's this?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.679
To make it look pretty.

35:00.880 --> 35:04.159
I've found 10 people named
Eugenio GutiÃ©rrez in Madrid

35:04.239 --> 35:05.800
but Chencho there's one.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.599
We'll have to go by car,
but it's worth trying...

35:10.280 --> 35:13.239
-But, how?
-The internet, my friend.

35:13.320 --> 35:17.599
It's the world's biggest archive,
but it doesn't exist.

35:17.679 --> 35:21.840
Well, it does,
but it's like it's in the air.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.760
On the waves.

35:24.840 --> 35:28.840
It doesn't matter. The thing is
you click on the search box, here,

35:28.920 --> 35:32.800
you type what you want to find.
That's how I got my degree.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.320
I'll pay,
we'll have our coffee and go.

36:02.239 --> 36:05.280
-Who's Felicidad MartÃ­nez?
-None of your business.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.960
Let's go.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.800
Okay, I'm sorry,
don't be such an asshole.

36:20.559 --> 36:22.239
Don't say a word, okay?

36:22.320 --> 36:24.079
<i>Look, I've been thinking</i>

36:24.159 --> 36:27.199
<i>that if you tell your boss</i>
<i>what you told me</i>

36:27.280 --> 36:30.119
<i>-he'll send you to an asylum.</i>
-You think I'm crazy?

36:30.199 --> 36:33.760
<i>-No, no. I didn't say that.</i>
-Well, you thought it, Riki.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.360
<i>Forgive me.</i>
<i>I might have been rude but...</i>

36:36.440 --> 36:38.320
Yes, and a fuckwit too.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.039
<i>If you're going to be like that,</i>
<i>let's hang up.</i>

36:41.119 --> 36:44.039
You know what? You're right.
We'll talk later, bye.

36:47.119 --> 36:49.280
It's good to give him hell
occasionally.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.400
-You talk to your husband like that?
-Husband?

36:52.480 --> 36:54.559
-He wishes.
-Your boyfriend.

36:56.199 --> 36:57.760
Well, something like that.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.559
-How long have you been together?
-A year and a half, more or less.

37:01.639 --> 37:03.599
Then he's your boyfriend.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.719
We're together, but boyfriend...

37:05.800 --> 37:07.880
you don't need to put a tag.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.760
-Why not? Everything has a tag.
-Yeah, you for example, are a pain.

37:11.840 --> 37:14.320
And my life is none of your business.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.960
SCRAPYARD

37:32.000 --> 37:34.079
What do we do? Do we call or...?

37:36.039 --> 37:37.519
Fuck! Great security.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.239
Look what a cute dog!
Holy fuck! Damn it all to hell!

37:58.320 --> 38:02.480
-Do you have to talk like that?
-You saw how it scared me?

38:06.599 --> 38:10.440
-You're a very good dog, aren't you?
-Hey, you've got a way with dogs.

38:11.960 --> 38:16.039
I had one many years ago.
Her name was Brisca.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.559
This one is named Brisca too.

38:22.199 --> 38:23.800
He's her great-great-grandson

38:29.480 --> 38:31.880
Chencho?

38:31.960 --> 38:34.039
Am I dreaming, Mr. GarcÃ­a?

38:35.760 --> 38:37.440
You're not, indeed.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.679
-What is it?
-I was hoping you could tell us.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.880
The young lady
opened the capsule

38:49.960 --> 38:52.480
by introducing it
in some kind of computer.

38:52.559 --> 38:55.239
I'm afraid I can't tell you
anything about it.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.519
Thank you.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.480
I always knew
you'd come back, Mr. GarcÃ­a.

39:01.559 --> 39:04.360
Ortiz believed you were dead.
I knew you weren't.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.239
Did he get away from Neffenberg?

39:06.320 --> 39:08.280
The Nazi scientist?

39:08.360 --> 39:09.800
But what does she know?

39:09.880 --> 39:12.840
She knows more than she should,
but we can trust her.

39:12.920 --> 39:16.480
Hey! You spent the night
in my bedroom.

39:16.559 --> 39:21.039
-Please continue.
-Ortiz fled, yes.

39:21.119 --> 39:23.639
He came back on foot
from the Pyrenees,

39:23.719 --> 39:26.760
and slept rough
to avoid check points.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.400
That guy is a hell of a kid.

39:30.679 --> 39:33.920
Your disappearance
was a very tough blow.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.159
There were no other agents like you.

39:36.239 --> 39:39.159
They restructured everything.
I never saw Ortiz again.

39:41.159 --> 39:45.679
Over the years,
Section Nine lost its power,

39:45.760 --> 39:48.199
and that always means losing money.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.039
Finally, I was fired.

39:52.679 --> 39:57.480
They gave me some money.
Not much, but enough to set this up.

39:57.559 --> 40:02.599
Although I can hardly do anything,
my sons take care of everything.

40:02.679 --> 40:04.119
So...

40:06.079 --> 40:07.960
is there no one or nothing left?

40:10.599 --> 40:12.559
There's something left.

40:21.039 --> 40:22.880
Wow! Amazing!

40:30.320 --> 40:34.480
Chencho... They look like they did
on the first day.

40:34.559 --> 40:37.400
They are impeccable.
I clean them every week.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.920
-May I?
-I don't recommend it, miss.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.239
They're hand grenades.

40:43.320 --> 40:47.039
Don't worry. They're harmless
unless you remove the wrap.

40:47.119 --> 40:49.519
Did you ever use them?

40:49.599 --> 40:52.679
Let's just say I don't like weapons.

40:52.760 --> 40:57.719
-What's this? A gun? A laser?
-A communicator.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.159
All the Section Nine agents
carried one

41:00.239 --> 41:02.320
so they could always be located.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.119
-Like your portable phones.
-Mobiles.

41:06.199 --> 41:08.360
A bit more rudimentary.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.519
A cigarette worked as an antenna.

41:11.599 --> 41:14.519
When you pulled it out,
it activated the signal.

41:14.599 --> 41:18.039
Here? Fuck!

41:18.119 --> 41:19.719
It still works?

41:19.800 --> 41:22.440
I don't know.
I haven't used them for years.

41:23.679 --> 41:25.960
-They are useless.
-May I?

41:29.760 --> 41:31.679
Agent GarcÃ­a speaking.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.800
Agent GarcÃ­a speaking.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.440
<i>Password.</i>

41:39.519 --> 41:41.199
Not a home without a fire.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.000
<i>Not a Spaniard without bread.</i>
<i>Go ahead, GarcÃ­a.</i>

41:44.079 --> 41:46.079
I request extraction.
It's an emergency.

41:46.159 --> 41:47.559
<i>What is your location?</i>

41:47.639 --> 41:51.199
No! Wait! How do we know it's them?
What if it's a trap?

41:52.840 --> 41:56.519
Recovery point number 27.
In two hours.

41:56.599 --> 41:58.400
<i>Roger. Over and out.</i>

41:59.440 --> 42:00.880
We have to go.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.920
-I told you I'm going with you.
-No.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.079
I already put you in danger once.
It's not gonna happen again.

42:07.159 --> 42:09.320
The car is mine.
I need to pull over.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.199
-Why?
-None of your business.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.199
-Does it have to be now?
-Yes.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.880
But the lady on your phone
is saying that we should...

42:16.960 --> 42:18.480
Enough! Enough!

42:18.559 --> 42:21.320
I've got my period.
You need to know everything?

42:21.400 --> 42:22.960
May I have my bag, please?

42:23.039 --> 42:24.480
-Yes.
-Thank you.

42:27.519 --> 42:29.119
Wait for me.

42:36.159 --> 42:38.599
<i>Move to the right lane.</i>

42:38.679 --> 42:44.440
<i>Continue for two kilometers</i>
<i>on Oliver Quesada street.</i>

42:51.119 --> 42:52.840
No, no, no.

42:56.079 --> 42:59.760
I can't believe this. Fuck my life!!

43:02.559 --> 43:04.119
No, no, no.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.519
Shit! Shit! Shit!

43:09.719 --> 43:14.480
<i>Continue on Oliver Quesada street.</i>

43:21.079 --> 43:22.960
Excuse me. The WIFI password?

43:23.039 --> 43:25.719
-One, two, three, four.
-Thank you.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.880
Will you be having something
or what?

43:27.960 --> 43:30.039
This is not an office, sweetie.

43:30.119 --> 43:34.000
You wouldn't believe what happened.
I was in a car with...

43:34.079 --> 43:37.519
with a friend. Ha dumped me.
He took my wallet, my phone--

43:37.599 --> 43:41.199
Come on, get out of here.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.639
Please, it'll only be a minute.
I promise.

43:43.719 --> 43:47.559
Give her a coffee, JuliÃ¡n.
And put it on my tab.

43:47.639 --> 43:48.960
Thank you.

43:50.760 --> 43:53.800
We've all been dumped by some sucker,
sweetheart.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.239
Come on! Come on!

44:04.679 --> 44:07.760
Yes! I've got you!
Can anyone give me a lift to Madrid?

44:28.920 --> 44:32.199
<i>I'm a Spaniard, a Spaniard,</i>
<i>a Spaniard!</i>

44:34.519 --> 44:37.400
Thank you very much.
You're saving my life, really.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.239
No need to thank me.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.119
I'll drop you
at the first metro station,

44:42.199 --> 44:43.840
and you manage from there.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.679
Are you okay with that, honey?

45:00.599 --> 45:04.719
Thanks, I've got no money,
but if I can do anything...

45:04.800 --> 45:06.679
Fuck. Seriously?

45:06.760 --> 45:10.119
I didn't say anything.
But if you're asking...

45:10.199 --> 45:11.920
Fuck!

45:13.960 --> 45:15.880
We have to leave. Now.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.639
No, no. This can't be happening.
Start the car!

45:19.719 --> 45:22.480
-What is he doing?
-Let's go!

45:22.559 --> 45:24.800
-Get out of the way, clown.
-Let's go!

45:24.880 --> 45:27.400
Calm down!
Do you want me to run him over?

45:27.480 --> 45:29.400
What? What the hell's wrong with you?

45:46.480 --> 45:49.159
-Help. Please. Help.
-What's going on?

45:49.239 --> 45:51.360
She's inside.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.360
-Is it the sucker?
-Yes.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.280
Get behind the bar, hurry.

46:08.639 --> 46:12.920
Well, well, well.
I love seeing a hunky guy in black.

46:14.559 --> 46:17.079
-Where is she?
-What will it be, stud?

46:17.159 --> 46:19.960
We have omelets,
pork loin, chorizo...

46:33.920 --> 46:37.679
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

46:56.400 --> 46:57.800
Copy that.

47:32.519 --> 47:34.119
Fuck!

47:52.920 --> 47:54.639
Fuck me!

48:07.360 --> 48:08.800
Fuck!

48:19.039 --> 48:23.280
Spain needs a strong government
more than ever!

48:25.000 --> 48:29.280
To free our Captain,
kidnapped by criminal groups!

48:29.360 --> 48:32.760
Criminals that come here
from other countries to steal!

48:33.880 --> 48:37.880
Criminals who want to break
the unity of Spain!

48:37.960 --> 48:40.079
Get out of here, Fascists!

48:40.159 --> 48:45.559
Criminals who kidnapped
our next president!

48:45.639 --> 48:48.800
But true Spaniards
aren't going to allow this!

48:48.880 --> 48:51.599
-Long live Spain!
-Long live!

48:51.679 --> 48:55.440
-Long live Spain!
-Long live!

48:55.519 --> 48:58.840
-Long live Spain!
-Long live!

48:58.920 --> 49:01.960
-Excuse me.
-My Captain, my president.

49:02.039 --> 49:03.960
Fuck!

49:04.039 --> 49:07.239
GarcÃ­a! GarcÃ­a!

49:08.519 --> 49:10.239
-Why are you here?
-Antonia!

49:10.320 --> 49:13.679
These assholes say
it was us who kidnapped the Captain.

49:13.760 --> 49:17.880
-People will end up believing it.
-It's him. The man from the crypt.

49:17.960 --> 49:21.320
Him! It doesn't matter.

49:21.400 --> 49:22.960
-GarcÃ­a!
-Antonia!

49:23.039 --> 49:27.039
-GarcÃ­a.
-I told you not to come!

49:27.119 --> 49:29.599
Hey, take it easy, Porter Wagoner.

49:29.679 --> 49:32.039
Is this person Ricardo?

49:32.119 --> 49:33.679
How does he know my name?

49:33.760 --> 49:35.440
The men in black are back.

49:35.519 --> 49:38.159
They arrived at the petrol station.
People died.

49:38.239 --> 49:41.760
Take it easy.
Stay with me and you'll be safe.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.320
Are you going to tell me
what is going on?

49:44.400 --> 49:46.559
What?

49:54.119 --> 49:55.519
Who is this guy?

49:58.639 --> 50:01.639
Riki! Riki!

50:02.079 --> 50:05.880
??? I said, who the fuck...!

50:10.760 --> 50:12.840
We are out!

50:12.920 --> 50:16.679
-Riki!
-Go, go!

50:16.760 --> 50:21.760
-Riki! Riki!
-He's fine! He's fine!

50:21.840 --> 50:24.000
In the car! Now!

50:24.079 --> 50:26.320
Not a home without a fire.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.039
-Come on!
-Quick!

50:32.480 --> 50:34.559
GarcÃ­a, fuck, quick!

50:42.320 --> 50:45.599
-We left Riki behind!
-We can't take any risks.

50:48.599 --> 50:50.719
Holy shit!

50:54.199 --> 50:56.000
Speed up!

51:07.599 --> 51:11.360
Fuck, fuck, they almost killed us!
Who was that guy?

51:11.440 --> 51:13.320
No, who is this guy?

51:13.400 --> 51:15.480
Everything's going to be fine.

51:15.559 --> 51:17.880
Where are you taking us?

51:17.960 --> 51:20.800
-With the good guys.
-What?

51:26.519 --> 51:28.400
THE NINE

51:40.920 --> 51:42.639
This way.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.599
That way.

52:30.679 --> 52:34.559
-This is the shit!
-Do you need to talk like that?

52:34.639 --> 52:36.559
I'll talk however the fuck I want.

52:36.639 --> 52:38.320
Sit here.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.199
The boss will be with you shortly.

52:46.679 --> 52:49.840
I'm freaking out.
Can you see what is going on here?

52:49.920 --> 52:52.880
A secret hideout
under a hardware store!

52:52.960 --> 52:55.320
It used to be underneath a cinema.

52:55.400 --> 52:56.760
In the middle of Gran VÃ­a.

53:02.559 --> 53:04.480
Ortiz?

53:09.960 --> 53:11.719
Dad?
