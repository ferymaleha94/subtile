00:38.719 --> 00:45.000
What a pretty thing.
Is it a present for me?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.280
If I like it, I'll get you another.
Okay?

00:49.280 --> 00:53.960
- Hey, it was just a joke.
- Should say "a drink," not "another".

00:53.960 --> 00:55.719
Let me go, you're hurting me.

00:55.719 --> 00:59.359
You say "another," people think
I'm a drunk drowning his sorrows.

00:59.359 --> 01:03.840
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
- They're going to get the wrong idea.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.400
They're going to think they know me,
but no one knows me.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.239
Do you get it?

01:13.120 --> 01:14.599
Let her go, kid.

01:23.359 --> 01:26.400
Sorry. I've had a bad day.
Give me a drink, I'll leave.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.519
Better to go home and sleep it off,

01:28.519 --> 01:30.040
it's late already.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.359
No, no, no!

02:08.599 --> 02:10.520
Where is it?

02:18.080 --> 02:19.400
Shit!

02:21.800 --> 02:23.080
Fuck!

02:35.560 --> 02:38.400
It is true what they say.

02:38.400 --> 02:44.039
A Section Nine agent is
always vigilant.

02:44.039 --> 02:48.439
- Even when he stinks of alcohol.
- Neffenberg...

02:48.439 --> 02:53.840
Would it be too much to ask for a
minute of your time, Agent Ortiz?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.439
We have nothing to talk about.

03:07.719 --> 03:09.759
I think we do.

03:32.159 --> 03:33.560
Leave.

03:38.479 --> 03:41.800
- We have to get out of here.
- Leave!

03:44.840 --> 03:46.719
Feli...

04:50.519 --> 04:53.040
Dad! We've already had
a whole bottle of wine.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.120
You're no fun, we're celebrating.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.360
What we're going to celebrate
is your next blood test.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.959
Jesus. What's going on?
Maybe it's the mistress.

05:01.959 --> 05:03.279
Dad!

05:05.720 --> 05:08.680
- What?
- Shit, shit, shit...

05:08.680 --> 05:10.160
What?

05:11.199 --> 05:12.600
Turn the TV on.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.920
<i>The National Police is searching
the area around the Prado Museum</i>

05:16.920 --> 05:19.160
<i>where a symbolic act for harmony</i>

05:19.160 --> 05:22.439
<i>between the leaders
of the main political parties</i>

05:22.439 --> 05:24.439
<i>was being held this afternoon</i>

05:24.439 --> 05:28.560
<i>and where opposition leader Pablo
Rodero allegedly disappeared...</i>

05:28.560 --> 05:31.240
Poor man. Horrifying.

05:31.240 --> 05:34.360
I should leave. In case there is
a meeting or something.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.120
- Want me to take you?
- Please.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.560
Don Jaime, my deepest apologies.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.720
- I'd love to have dinner another day.
- Of course, of course, go ahead.

05:45.279 --> 05:47.480
Dad, thank you.

05:50.279 --> 05:53.399
<i>Pablo Rodero was kidnapped
this evening.</i>

05:53.399 --> 05:55.279
<i>He was running for election.</i>

05:55.279 --> 05:58.360
<i>According to National Police
and Civil Guard sources,</i>

05:58.360 --> 06:01.519
<i>no one has taken responsibility
for the kidnapping...</i>

06:42.720 --> 06:45.240
<i>Pablo Rodero
was kidnapped this evening.</i>

06:45.240 --> 06:47.160
<i>He was running for election.</i>

06:47.160 --> 06:50.560
<i>According to National Police
and Civil Guard sources,</i>

06:50.560 --> 06:52.959
<i>no one has taken credit
for the kidnapping</i>

06:52.959 --> 06:56.000
<i>but it is suspected
that it may be a response</i>

06:56.000 --> 06:58.959
<i>to the kidnapping of Catalina
Bellido, alias "The Captain,"</i>

06:58.959 --> 07:00.759
<i>which took place six days ago.</i>

07:00.759 --> 07:03.319
<i>There have been no
official statements yet.</i>

07:03.319 --> 07:05.040
<i>Tension can be ...</i>

07:14.120 --> 07:15.959
This shouldn't be happening.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.000
If you had listened to me,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.120
if you helped me when I asked you,
we wouldn't be in this situation now.

07:27.120 --> 07:31.240
Rodero has been kidnapped.
I have no fucking idea who or why.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.360
I don't know what's going on.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.759
- Manolo, not again, please...
- Don't "Manolo" me!

07:37.759 --> 07:40.959
You never stopped saying
that I was your most trusted man,

07:40.959 --> 07:42.959
that I'd always be by your side...

07:42.959 --> 07:45.360
You can still stop this.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.759
- Listen to me, there's a way out.
- Of course there's a way out...

07:49.759 --> 07:51.480
...for you!

07:51.480 --> 07:55.160
I go to jail and don't say a word.
And then what?

07:55.160 --> 07:56.839
Pardon? Conditional release?

07:56.839 --> 07:59.000
- We'll take care of your family.
- Sure...

08:00.319 --> 08:03.959
You've done a lot for the party.
A lot for me. I won't forget that.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.480
Now you won't forget it?

08:05.480 --> 08:07.439
You didn't remember the Russians!

08:07.439 --> 08:08.759
I was very nervous!

08:10.360 --> 08:12.120
I'm dealing with elections...

08:12.120 --> 08:16.279
I'm so sorry, Manolo.
I didn't even know what I was saying.

08:16.279 --> 08:17.759
And now you do?

08:20.480 --> 08:23.079
I do know I want
to make things right.

08:25.079 --> 08:26.560
- Yes?
- Yes.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.959
I can see that.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.839
Everything we've been
through together...

08:31.839 --> 08:33.960
All the money we've shared...

08:33.960 --> 08:36.639
Now you throw me under the bus
to save your ass.

08:36.639 --> 08:40.120
That's your way to make things right.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.840
Everyone always mixed up in shit,
and you always untouched.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.159
Cause shit never touches you.
Let me tell you one thing,

08:47.159 --> 08:50.799
I'm not going to jail for you
or for anybody.

08:50.799 --> 08:52.320
Do you understand?

08:52.320 --> 08:54.399
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

08:54.399 --> 08:57.240
Good. Well, first things first.
The Russians.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.279
They're looking for me
to make sure business continues.

09:00.279 --> 09:03.200
You're going to get them off my back
no matter what,

09:03.200 --> 09:05.240
make up whatever story you need to.

09:06.799 --> 09:11.519
Either that...
or never leave this place.

09:28.480 --> 09:33.000
- Holy shit! What the fuck?
- Don't yell.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.799
Dad! Help! Dad!
There's a robber in the house!

09:35.799 --> 09:38.360
- Bring your shotgun!
- I'm not here to steal.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.399
My name is García.
I need your help.

09:40.399 --> 09:41.879
What do you want?

09:41.879 --> 09:43.759
Do you think your parents woke up?

09:45.039 --> 09:48.320
- They're not here.
- And they don't have a shotgun.

09:50.159 --> 09:51.720
Good thinking.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.559
What happened to you?

09:53.559 --> 09:55.840
Long story.
But first I need a phone.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.240
With wires, without,
whatever you've got.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.080
I'll just be a minute, I promise.

10:01.399 --> 10:03.679
Do you mind if I turn
the camera off ?

10:03.679 --> 10:05.679
- We're live.
- What were you doing?

10:07.840 --> 10:09.080
Working.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.919
Help me.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.399
- Yes?
<i>- Agent García speaking.</i>

10:24.399 --> 10:27.440
García! I've been trying
to contact you for hours.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.480
My phone is useless.
The police ambushed me at Feli's.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.919
I defended myself,
but there was an accident.

10:34.559 --> 10:36.200
She's dead, Ortiz.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.559
I'm very sorry.

10:40.559 --> 10:43.360
<i>I can't even imagine...</i>

10:43.360 --> 10:44.840
It was my fault.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.919
<i>Something failed in the mission,
they found me.</i>

10:47.919 --> 10:53.159
- Wait, wait... where are you?
- Close. Within the police perimeter.

10:53.159 --> 10:55.519
There are agents
and they have a gyroplane.

10:55.519 --> 10:58.240
We can't come in there,
you have to leave.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.960
- Can anyone pick me up?
- The C2 access is the safest.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.600
I'll be there in half an hour.
Over and out.

11:13.519 --> 11:15.639
All those pigs are looking for you?

11:15.639 --> 11:19.240
It's a mistake, I'll figure it out.
Thanks for your help.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.720
This shit is lit. Wait!

11:30.759 --> 11:32.559
Try this on.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.120
Why the silver wings?

11:36.120 --> 11:38.559
It's a band. Icarus Wings.

11:38.559 --> 11:40.600
They've got an ethereal wave vibe.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.159
I'll be the center of attention.

11:43.159 --> 11:45.080
More than with a suit like that?

11:47.519 --> 11:49.240
How do I get out of here?

11:51.720 --> 11:53.120
Through the garage.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.240
We get out through here and done.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.639
Two streets left
there's a subway station.

11:57.639 --> 11:59.639
Do you use the subway? No...

11:59.639 --> 12:02.200
Well, either way,
this is a very calm street.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.679
So relax, there'll be no issues.

12:14.679 --> 12:18.000
Here is fine.
Thanks for everything, Rafael.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.559
- I'll give it back when I can.
- Keep it.

12:20.559 --> 12:22.600
Their third album was shit.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.080
Don't talk about this with anyone. Ever.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.080
- You know that, right?
- No worries.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.960
Sucks, I would get
a ton of followers out of this.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.960
Relax, it's all good.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.720
García.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.279
Sorry about your girlfriend.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.759
Give those fuckers hell!

13:00.919 --> 13:02.679
Do we know
anything about Rodero?

13:02.679 --> 13:05.440
- Nothing yet.
- They're preparing a statement.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.840
Usual, saying they trust in
state security forces and to wait.

13:09.919 --> 13:13.360
Wait for what? Look at Twitter.
Everyone knows who it was.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.799
- Who?
- Who do you think?

13:15.799 --> 13:18.240
They've been accusing us
of the kidnapping.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.120
She had eight charges of corruption.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.200
She probably ran off to a tax haven.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.960
Until she turns up,
Hernando says it was commies,

13:25.960 --> 13:28.799
idiots believe him,
kidnaps Pablo in retaliation.

13:28.799 --> 13:33.000
- We still don't know who did it.
- I'll tell you who did it.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.159
The far right, been ruling
this country for 40 years.

13:36.159 --> 13:38.240
ETA's not around,
we're the bad guys.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.120
- Hey, don't get all paranoid.
- Dude, we're already seeing it.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.200
The guy who beat your ass?

13:44.200 --> 13:47.279
That one? An undercover cop.
For sure.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.960
Okay, let's see, this hasn't been
officially organized, has it?

13:52.960 --> 13:56.159
There's no fucking need.
Come on, let's go!

13:59.200 --> 14:01.360
Riki, wait.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.919
I have to talk to you.
It's important.

14:46.279 --> 14:50.120
- How are you feeling?
- I've had better decades.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.840
Right.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.440
I'll give you a quick checkup now,

14:57.519 --> 15:00.519
but you'll need a full examination
at the headquarters.

15:02.759 --> 15:05.399
Sit down. Take that off.

15:05.399 --> 15:08.639
I've gone over the mission
a thousand times, Benito,

15:08.639 --> 15:11.000
and I'm sure
I didn't make any mistakes.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.960
If we've been sold out,
we have to act now.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.440
Sooner we make our move, sooner
we know where the leak came from.

15:19.759 --> 15:23.720
Well, well... relax. We know.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.799
It was us.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.279
Relax.
I've been reading reports about you.

15:32.279 --> 15:36.720
Your body processes any foreign
element at an impressive speed,

15:36.720 --> 15:39.399
so I've had to triple the usual dose.

15:39.399 --> 15:41.519
It's just a little nap.

15:41.519 --> 15:42.840
<i>Leave!</i>

15:49.440 --> 15:54.759
Here, here! Put him in the trunk!

15:54.759 --> 15:57.320
- Yes, sir.
- Go, go!

16:01.799 --> 16:04.279
Say something, dude...

16:04.279 --> 16:10.840
So, your father is the leader
of some sort of...

16:12.159 --> 16:14.080
...secret agency,

16:14.080 --> 16:15.840
that controls...

16:16.919 --> 16:20.559
...a Francoist super-soldier who's
been awakened after 60 years

16:20.559 --> 16:23.480
to kidnap the leader
of our political party.

16:23.480 --> 16:29.519
- Yes, more or less, yes.
- Okay...

16:29.519 --> 16:32.840
So you must be some kind of alien,
a mutant like...

16:35.039 --> 16:39.720
- Oh, right, I'm crazy. What?
- Hey, hey! I believe you.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.320
You couldn't have made up
such an absurd story.

16:44.519 --> 16:46.240
So?

16:47.399 --> 16:48.799
So we call the police.

16:50.519 --> 16:54.320
Wait, wait. Why the police?
What are you going to say?

16:54.320 --> 16:57.360
That we might know
who kidnapped Rodero.

16:58.759 --> 17:03.919
- Do you want to report my father?
- You don't?

17:03.919 --> 17:08.920
Riki, I mean... yes, okay.
Maybe he's done bad things,

17:08.920 --> 17:11.519
but out of patriotic love
and all that shit.

17:11.519 --> 17:14.920
But maybe not.
Maybe he had nothing to do with it.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.640
The police should decide.

17:16.640 --> 17:21.200
Riki! He's my dad. He's old and...

17:22.279 --> 17:26.200
Fuck! His heart is weak. If they
arrest him, he might drop dead.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.480
I don't think a murderer
of republicans

17:28.480 --> 17:30.519
will be scared
by a few police officers.

17:30.519 --> 17:33.559
- My father hasn't killed anyone.
- How do you know that?

17:40.440 --> 17:42.359
Okay... look.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.480
What do you want to do?

17:50.720 --> 17:52.200
I don't know.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.240
There you go.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.440
No. No.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.839
Seriously?

18:11.240 --> 18:13.519
- Please.
- So why the hell did you tell me?

18:13.519 --> 18:16.319
- I thought you would understand.
- Understand what?

18:16.319 --> 18:18.279
- Fuck! He's my dad!
- I know that!

18:18.279 --> 18:20.799
Is your family more important
than Rodero's?

18:22.119 --> 18:24.400
- It's the only thing I have.
- The only thing?

18:31.119 --> 18:36.279
How won't I understand?
We're bending over backwards.

18:36.279 --> 18:38.920
I have the whole team
working on this matter.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.000
You can leave it over there.

18:46.319 --> 18:49.519
I have a meeting in 15 minutes.
We'll talk after that.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.880
Yes, yes, I'll call you back. Bye.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.319
It was Foreign Affairs.

18:59.319 --> 19:03.000
In Brussels, they're starting
to wonder what the hell we are doing.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.079
- Jaime, we've got to stop this now!
- Everything's under control.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.119
I have a dead civilian
and five dead policemen,

19:12.119 --> 19:15.960
two political candidates kidnapped
and, if that weren't enough,

19:15.960 --> 19:18.720
there's a group of radicals
in the streets

19:18.720 --> 19:21.160
inciting people to take the Congress.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.839
Would you care to explain how the
hell "everything's under control"?

19:26.839 --> 19:31.759
Well... we can still fix this mess.

19:31.759 --> 19:36.240
Tell me what Rodero said,
where did they hide the Captain?

19:36.240 --> 19:39.960
Rodero didn't say anything.
He doesn't know.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.720
He didn't order
the Captain's kidnapping.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.920
He's a commie and a radical,
but he's not crazy.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.759
Let's see... you said...

19:48.759 --> 19:52.279
I said what you needed to hear
to step forward

19:52.279 --> 19:54.160
and take control of this.

19:54.160 --> 19:59.240
García made some trouble for us, yes.
But I'm sure I can fix that.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.240
The plan goes ahead.
There's no turning back now.

20:05.359 --> 20:07.319
I don't think you are
understanding me.

20:08.519 --> 20:11.880
I'm not suggesting you
abort the plan, Jaime.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.519
I'm ordering you to do it.

20:16.599 --> 20:19.400
I think it's you
who doesn't understand me.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.920
In 15 minutes you have a meeting
with your cabinet.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.960
Tell them that the plan is going
forward, everything is under control.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.519
But that we need more men
and more resources.

20:30.519 --> 20:32.400
What? Have you lost your mind?

20:35.759 --> 20:37.359
Look...

20:43.000 --> 20:48.559
- What's this?
- It's your approval to kidnap Rodero.

20:48.559 --> 20:50.799
We don't throw anything
away around here.

20:52.319 --> 20:56.759
Everything is stored away,
but there are leaks sometimes.

20:58.519 --> 21:01.960
Are you threatening me?

21:01.960 --> 21:05.359
Do you think I did all of this
because I want your head?

21:05.359 --> 21:07.559
You understand nothing.

21:07.559 --> 21:11.920
You're not important, you're nobody.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.039
I'll solve this crisis for you.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.599
You'll win the elections
and I'll get the commie

21:17.599 --> 21:21.359
and the Captain and their cronies
off of your back.

21:21.359 --> 21:24.400
I'm going to give you back
the country you've lost.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.640
All wrapped up
with a red and yellow bow.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.000
Yes?

22:26.200 --> 22:28.480
Honey, how are you?

22:28.480 --> 22:32.000
<i>Fine. What about you?
Is something wrong?</i>

22:32.000 --> 22:34.480
No, no. Everything's okay.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.039
Everything's okay.

22:36.039 --> 22:39.640
I meant to call earlier, but
we've been busy at the Ministry.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.559
How is the kid? Is he with you?

22:41.559 --> 22:45.319
<i>Good, already asleep.
He really wants to see you.</i>

22:45.319 --> 22:47.720
- Yes.
<i>- I really want to see you too.</i>

22:47.720 --> 22:50.960
<i>- When is this going to be over?</i>
- Isa, don't fucking start.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.440
I've already told you,
it's for your safety.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.200
Now Rodero's been kidnapped.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.680
The President takes a guard with him
to pee.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.559
<i>But who would want to kidnap us?</i>

22:59.559 --> 23:02.519
<i>Manolo, don't you think
you're overreacting...</i>

23:02.519 --> 23:05.920
You're in an amazing fucking
hotel having fun, aren't you?

23:05.920 --> 23:08.039
Then lay the fuck off me!

23:09.400 --> 23:11.400
<i>Why are you talking to me like that?</i>

23:12.480 --> 23:14.839
Honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm very nervous.

23:14.839 --> 23:19.440
Don't you worry, honey.
This will end and it will end soon.

23:21.880 --> 23:26.119
<i>Okay. I'll tell the kid.
But please take care, please.</i>

23:26.119 --> 23:31.759
<i>- I love you very much.</i>
- I do too.

23:31.759 --> 23:37.240
- I love you too. Okay, bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

24:02.559 --> 24:03.960
Yes?

24:03.960 --> 24:06.119
<i>Don't answer "yes"
to unknown numbers.</i>

24:06.119 --> 24:10.640
They could record you, and then use
your voice for whatever they want.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.519
You've always been a bit careless, Manolo.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.000
Who are you?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.799
<i>Like when you took Catalina.</i>

24:19.200 --> 24:22.440
Look, I don't know who you are,
I'm going to hang up.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.119
<i>You can't fix the situation
with the Russians.</i>

24:25.119 --> 24:27.519
They don't care about the Captain.

24:27.519 --> 24:30.240
They don't care
who gets charged with corruption.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.720
They only want their business
to keep going.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.200
And you know how they do things.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.240
<i>First a warning and then...
well, you know.</i>

24:38.240 --> 24:40.279
<i>So right now you have two options.</i>

24:41.359 --> 24:45.079
Talk to me and fix this disaster,

24:45.079 --> 24:48.640
or hang up and wait for the Russians
to find you.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.200
What do you want?
What do you want?

24:54.200 --> 24:57.119
<i>Hello? You still there?</i>

24:58.680 --> 25:01.039
<i>Hello? Please just...</i>

25:08.519 --> 25:12.759
- Where have you been?
- God, you scared me.

25:12.759 --> 25:16.279
And you me. Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you?

25:17.400 --> 25:20.440
- Did you clean your room?
- Yes.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.319
I dusted, organized books,
put in a load of laundry

25:23.319 --> 25:26.119
but I did something wrong,
my whites are pink now.

25:26.119 --> 25:29.599
I don't care, but my sleeping
shirt was in there which I loved,

25:29.599 --> 25:31.680
I won't find another one like it.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.079
What's wrong, dear?

25:34.559 --> 25:36.440
Is it because of Ricardo?

25:38.319 --> 25:43.400
- Dad, did you kidnap Rodero?
- What?

25:43.400 --> 25:47.079
I started thinking about it,
and it didn't seem that strange.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.759
The envelope about García...

25:48.759 --> 25:51.079
I thought it was for me,
was it for you?

25:51.079 --> 25:52.559
I don't know who sent it

25:52.559 --> 25:54.880
but you're the leader
of a secret agency.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.079
Everyone knows
what secret agencies do.

25:57.079 --> 26:00.279
I thought you don't do those things,
but I talked to Riki

26:00.279 --> 26:03.559
and he said you killed people.
I don't want to believe it.

26:03.559 --> 26:06.680
I came home very angry,
but when I thought about it,

26:06.680 --> 26:08.440
it didn't seem that strange,

26:08.440 --> 26:10.920
then I started to clean
so I wouldn't think,

26:10.920 --> 26:14.200
and that's when the white-pink
clothes thing happened.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.920
It was García.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.480
García?
What do you mean García?

26:23.559 --> 26:25.640
It was my fault.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.559
We were trying to find the Captain

26:28.559 --> 26:32.960
and I thought he was ready to come
back, that he could be useful,

26:32.960 --> 26:34.640
but he acted on his own.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.200
And has he kidnapped Rodero?
But, why?

26:37.200 --> 26:39.880
He thinks he's
behind the kidnapping.

26:39.880 --> 26:44.519
And in his time, people like Rodero
were arrested and tortured.

26:45.599 --> 26:47.640
He's a man of the past.

26:47.640 --> 26:52.440
Antonia, he doesn't belong
in a democratic world

26:52.440 --> 26:56.519
that respects people's freedom
and rights.

26:56.519 --> 26:59.680
No, no, no. It can't be.
He's not like that. I know him.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.240
I've also known him for years.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.759
And these are the things he does.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.799
The police found him.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.759
They tried to arrest him
and he set off an explosion.

27:16.759 --> 27:19.200
A lot of people died.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.880
We've tried to keep it
as quiet as possible,

27:21.880 --> 27:24.400
but I'm afraid it might
be on the news by now.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.319
We have to neutralize him
before he kills someone else.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.119
But... he's your friend.

27:39.039 --> 27:40.720
He was my friend.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.039
Now he's a murderer.

28:06.359 --> 28:07.759
You should eat.

28:12.720 --> 28:16.839
If I wanted you dead, I would have
let Section Nine finish the job.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.480
You've were lucky
we were tracking Benito,

28:20.480 --> 28:23.200
so you should thank me
for rescuing you.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.000
You don't understand
what you are doing here.

28:34.599 --> 28:36.720
How can you be alive?

28:39.319 --> 28:42.200
We have a lot to talk about,
Agent García.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.240
In a civilized manner.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.279
You weren't betrayed yesterday.
You were betrayed on that train.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.359
60 years ago.

29:09.359 --> 29:13.079
My father, Neffenberg, made a deal
with your little friend Ortiz.

29:13.079 --> 29:15.720
If I failed, he'd allow himself
to be captured.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.960
He knew that you would surrender.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.559
I failed... but I didn't die.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.519
Our contact in France knew nothing.

31:46.519 --> 31:49.480
The Russian government didn't either.

31:49.480 --> 31:55.480
It was as if all of you
vanished into thin air.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.960
I've been looking for you all
for 60 years.

32:01.359 --> 32:02.799
My father,

32:02.799 --> 32:05.920
Agent Ortiz, you.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.200
And all of a sudden...

32:08.200 --> 32:09.680
here you are.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.759
It's hard to believe
but that's how it is.

32:13.759 --> 32:16.960
The only thing I had after Canfranc
was your capsule code.

32:16.960 --> 32:20.680
That and a tracking protocol
that was activated three days ago.

32:20.680 --> 32:24.519
My father and I were the only ones
who knew the code for your capsule.

32:24.519 --> 32:28.599
So obviously, my father woke you up.

32:28.599 --> 32:32.279
Professor Neffenberg died
in a plane crash in 1964.

32:32.279 --> 32:36.119
- How do you know?
- Section Nine was looking for him.

32:36.119 --> 32:37.839
Ortiz showed me the file.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.680
It can't be.
A man like him, he can't be dead.

32:49.880 --> 32:55.640
You've been fooled again.
Ortiz has tricked you again.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.920
What if Ortiz was the one who sent
that journalist to open your capsule?

32:59.920 --> 33:02.920
Don't you see it?
This is what's going to happen.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.599
You are going to take me
to where Ortiz is

33:05.599 --> 33:08.880
and Ortiz is going to tell me
where my father is. Okay?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.960
No.

33:18.839 --> 33:23.599
You owe him nothing. He tried
to kill you! Why protect him?

33:29.039 --> 33:30.279
What are you doing?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.759
No, no, no.
Wait! Wait!

34:09.679 --> 34:13.079
No, no, no. No! No!

34:37.119 --> 34:39.639
Fuck!
Sound the alarm!

34:42.159 --> 34:45.679
Close the exit now!
He can't get out!

34:48.639 --> 34:52.119
We are fucked!
Someone look for Winters now!

35:09.280 --> 35:10.599
<i>Next train to...</i>

35:39.000 --> 35:40.840
Riki: 3 text messages 6 missed calls

35:47.480 --> 35:50.639
<i>Although the number of wounded
officers is still unknown,</i>

35:50.639 --> 35:52.800
<i>one fatality has been confirmed:</i>

35:52.800 --> 35:55.760
<i>a 78-year-old woman,
resident of the building,</i>

<i>...a 78-year-old woman,

36:03.760 --> 36:06.599
<i>who was in the apartment

<i>when the explosion occurred...</i>

36:10.079 --> 36:12.880
Silvia: audio message

36:14.079 --> 36:15.840
<i>Antonia, you're not picking up.</i>

36:15.840 --> 36:18.639
<i>You heard about the kidnapping
and the explosion?</i>

36:18.639 --> 36:21.159
<i>Think it could have been...
you know who?</i>

36:21.159 --> 36:24.000
<i>This is crazy, and there was
a victim, an old lady,</i>

36:24.000 --> 36:27.199
<i>they're saying her name
was Felicidad Martínez.</i>

36:27.199 --> 36:29.599
<i>Honey, call me when you can.</i>

36:31.599 --> 36:34.320
Do you want to have breakfast
with me at the bar?

36:34.320 --> 36:37.639
I don't really feel like it,
my stomach is kind of upset...

36:37.639 --> 36:40.239
Do you want me to make you
a chamomile tea?

36:40.239 --> 36:44.079
No, I'm just going to stay in bed
for a bit and I'm sure it will pass.

36:44.079 --> 36:47.199
Okay, I'll call you later.
Get some rest.

36:47.199 --> 36:48.519
Thank you.

36:59.119 --> 37:01.480
<i>The number you are calling is
turned off...</i>

37:01.480 --> 37:02.800
Fuck, García!

37:38.760 --> 37:43.639
Hi. I thought you might be here.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.639
I'm really sorry about Felicidad.

37:56.639 --> 37:58.480
Was she your girlfriend?

38:06.639 --> 38:10.679
Since you were looking for her...

38:10.679 --> 38:12.280
I'm guessing you found her?

38:12.280 --> 38:14.000
And I saw on the news that...

38:17.000 --> 38:20.679
- Well, I'm really sorry, García.
- Did your father send you?

38:21.920 --> 38:24.480
No. He doesn't know I'm here.

38:28.719 --> 38:30.599
So why did you come, Antonia?

38:32.719 --> 38:36.920
So someone would tell me the truth!
Did you kidnap Rodero?

38:43.119 --> 38:44.800
Yes.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.159
They told me he was behind
the Captain's kidnapping.

38:55.159 --> 38:57.679
Even if it wasn't true,
he is a communist,

38:57.679 --> 39:02.320
- an agent for the Soviets...
- Wait! Rodero, a communist? Please.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.239
And even if he were, so what?

39:04.239 --> 39:06.519
You can be a communist. It's legal.

39:06.519 --> 39:09.280
What's not legal is kidnapping
an innocent man.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.719
- What is the GAL? What the fuck?
- Your father gave me the order.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.960
I can't believe it.

39:25.559 --> 39:26.800
So it was true.

39:30.079 --> 39:31.519
You know what?

39:31.519 --> 39:33.400
Section Nine is a piece of shit,

39:33.400 --> 39:36.719
who knows how many people you
kidnapped, tortured, killed...

39:36.719 --> 39:38.320
I was going to quit.

39:43.760 --> 39:48.760
Look, your father
and I were soldiers,

39:48.760 --> 39:51.239
we defended our country.

39:52.719 --> 39:56.639
We aren't proud of the things
we did, but they had to be done.

40:01.559 --> 40:05.559
And then... I met Feli.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.239
She...

40:10.800 --> 40:12.679
She changed everything.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.119
I couldn't do what I was doing
and look her in the eyes.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.079
And what happened?

40:28.400 --> 40:30.199
Your father betrayed me.

40:31.559 --> 40:34.239
He sold me to Neffenberg.

40:34.239 --> 40:38.000
I spent 60 years frozen
in that crypt.

40:42.119 --> 40:44.360
He took away everything I had.

40:46.119 --> 40:48.639
Everything I could have had.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.159
And now what do we do?

41:03.880 --> 41:05.440
What do we do?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.480
García, my father lied to me,

41:10.480 --> 41:15.559
he betrayed you 60 years ago
by becoming allies with a crazy Nazi.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.760
And he betrayed you again now...

41:21.719 --> 41:23.480
I can't go home, you know?

41:25.840 --> 41:27.880
I couldn't even look him in the face.

41:31.320 --> 41:35.800
And you, the police are probably
looking for you. So...

41:37.239 --> 41:40.960
- What do we do now?
- Escape! You have to get out of here!

41:40.960 --> 41:43.559
Section Nine! Come on, quick!

41:46.480 --> 41:49.000
We're really going to escape
in this tricycle?

41:49.000 --> 41:52.719
- It's an ultra-modern vehicle.
- Yeah, 60 years ago.

41:52.719 --> 41:57.239
It's all checked up and
with a full tank. This way, quick.

41:57.239 --> 41:59.800
- What about you, Chencho?
- Don't worry about me.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.960
Are you sure this car is going
to work?

42:17.079 --> 42:19.719
No! No!

42:19.719 --> 42:21.199
Yes?

42:26.119 --> 42:28.760
What are you doing?
This thing doesn't have airbags!

42:41.519 --> 42:43.039
Stop! Stop! It's here.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.559
Wow, what a rush!

42:51.559 --> 42:54.880
Dude, you're fucking Fernando Alonso.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.719
- They called me the Spanish Fangio.
- Who is Fangio?

42:57.719 --> 43:01.119
- Who is Fernando Alonso?
- It doesn't matter, you're better.

43:01.119 --> 43:04.400
- You'll be okay with me. Trust me.
- I'm not too sure.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.320
Your father found Feli
and also Chencho's garage.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.960
I don't have any contacts left,
if they're even alive.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.840
Your father knows them too.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.280
I'm sure that my father
won't find us here.

43:23.039 --> 43:27.000
<i>Long live the couple! Yay!</i>

43:27.000 --> 43:29.239
- Antonia!
- Look at you!

43:29.239 --> 43:30.920
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

43:30.920 --> 43:32.519
Tell me he's the stripper.

43:32.519 --> 43:35.559
- No. A friend. From work.
- What a shame!

43:35.559 --> 43:38.280
But let's get something to drink,
I got married!

43:40.360 --> 43:44.079
Congratulations. I wish you
and your wife much happiness.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.559
Wife, come here! Antonia's here!

43:49.760 --> 43:51.800
The stripper, right?

43:51.800 --> 43:56.239
- Congratulations! Hey, is Riki here?
- He's around here somewhere.

43:56.239 --> 43:59.079
Today I only have eyes
for my husband.

44:01.599 --> 44:03.400
Come on! Get a drink!

44:05.000 --> 44:08.800
- What kind of a joke is this? They...
- They are my friends.

44:08.800 --> 44:11.719
Juanfran and Carles.
Two people who love each other.

44:11.719 --> 44:13.199
We're in their house.

44:13.199 --> 44:15.679
In your time
this might have been different

44:15.679 --> 44:18.320
but here you stick that homophobic
shit where the sun don't shine.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.559
And now...
I'm going to get a drink.

44:22.239 --> 44:26.920
<i>Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!</i>

44:35.519 --> 44:37.400
Fuck, Riki!

44:40.039 --> 44:43.480
- You came. Yes, yes...
- Yes. Here I am, right?

44:43.480 --> 44:47.079
Well, it's their wedding.
They'd kill me if I didn't.

44:47.079 --> 44:50.880
You want a drink, honey?
You and I are going to have fun!

44:52.960 --> 44:57.000
You brought a criminal from another
era to your friends' wedding?

44:57.000 --> 45:02.639
We're being followed by Section Nine!
We needed a place to hide and...

45:03.719 --> 45:07.000
Well, okay... yes. I'm sorry.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.239
- I shouldn't have come. We'll leave.
- No. Don't leave. Forgive me.

45:12.239 --> 45:14.159
What?

45:14.159 --> 45:16.039
Let's see...

45:18.360 --> 45:22.079
Lately there's been a lot of things
that I haven't understood.

45:23.760 --> 45:26.239
But I do have one thing
that's very clear:

45:27.320 --> 45:31.400
I don't want you to think
that all you have is your father.

45:31.400 --> 45:37.000
So tonight we are going to dance
and have fun.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.920
And tomorrow I'll think of some way
to help you.

45:41.559 --> 45:43.320
Help us both?

45:44.840 --> 45:47.079
Could you pass me the guitar please?

45:50.119 --> 45:51.360
Both of you.

45:57.440 --> 46:02.360
Everyone! To the living room.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.599
Come on!

46:04.599 --> 46:07.199
Everyone here.
It's about to start.

46:07.199 --> 46:09.599
I want to say something!

46:09.599 --> 46:12.480
First, thank you to everyone
for coming.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.599
I love you a lot
and I'm going to miss you.

46:16.800 --> 46:19.920
Please, come visit us soon and...

46:19.920 --> 46:22.480
bring Spanish ham,
there's none in New Zealand.

46:24.519 --> 46:28.840
Riki... thank you for introducing me
to the love of my life.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.400
My pleasure.

46:30.400 --> 46:35.119
And lastly, thanks to Carles,
for being the love of my life,

46:35.119 --> 46:39.599
for saying yes when
I asked you to marry me

46:39.599 --> 46:43.199
because you are the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

46:44.840 --> 46:46.840
And this one's for you.

47:11.519 --> 47:15.360
<i>God with his power...</i>

47:15.360 --> 47:20.079
<i>wanted...</i>

47:20.079 --> 47:24.719
<i>to melt four little sun rays...</i>

47:24.719 --> 47:29.519
<i>and make a woman with them.</i>

47:29.519 --> 47:33.480
<i>And when his will...</i>

47:33.480 --> 47:37.239
<i>was completed...</i>

47:40.559 --> 47:43.760
<i>I was born in a Spanish garden...</i>

47:46.480 --> 47:49.039
<i>Go and get them!</i>

47:49.039 --> 47:51.039
<i>Leave!</i>

47:52.239 --> 47:53.800
<i>Agent García! García!</i>

47:53.800 --> 47:55.519
<i>- Mom!
- Garcia!</i>

48:03.360 --> 48:08.159
<i>Thank you very much! I love you!</i>

48:10.320 --> 48:15.800
<i>- You're such a funny character.
- No, I'm usually not that funny.</i>

48:15.800 --> 48:19.599
<i>It's been a great pleasure. I had
such a good time with you tonight.</i>

48:19.599 --> 48:22.599
<i>- I feel the same, Miss.
- Cheers.</i>

48:22.599 --> 48:26.119
- We'll see each other. Bye.
- Bye.

48:29.800 --> 48:33.320
- The girl who was singing?
- Susana.

48:33.320 --> 48:36.280
- She's a charming woman.
- Cool.

48:36.280 --> 48:39.880
Riki said we can sleep over here
if we want.

48:41.480 --> 48:44.719
Thank him, but that
won't be necessary. I'm leaving.

48:44.719 --> 48:46.199
Where?

48:53.599 --> 48:55.360
Everything has changed, Antonia,

48:57.440 --> 49:01.400
but those guys in there...
Juanfran and Carles,

49:01.400 --> 49:03.559
Susana, Riki...

49:04.760 --> 49:07.119
...they're Spaniards.

49:07.119 --> 49:11.320
Carles might tell you something else,
but fine. Spaniards. So what?

49:12.679 --> 49:16.119
I promised to fight for them,
to protect them.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.280
And your father promised the same.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.079
Are you going to report him
to police?

49:23.079 --> 49:24.840
No.

49:26.599 --> 49:28.239
Are you going to kill him?

49:30.159 --> 49:32.280
Do you think I want to kill him?

49:34.159 --> 49:36.920
Well, I guess so, right?

49:38.000 --> 49:41.559
Because it was his fault Feli died.
And he wanted to kill you too.

49:41.559 --> 49:44.679
Because he's...
because he's a murderer.

49:46.679 --> 49:48.280
He's my friend.

49:50.639 --> 49:53.199
If there's anything left in him
of the man I knew,

49:54.519 --> 49:57.199
that man deserves a chance.

49:57.199 --> 50:01.400
I'm going to talk to him and
I'll listen to what he has to say.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.639
Great idea.

50:14.280 --> 50:18.079
He's not picking up.
He might have his mobile on silent.

50:18.079 --> 50:20.119
- He's not home.
- Don't you worry.

50:20.119 --> 50:22.199
He'll be at the locksmith's.

50:22.199 --> 50:25.719
Right, of course.
And how are we going to get in?

50:30.079 --> 50:31.559
Damn...

50:54.119 --> 50:56.159
Where is my father?

50:59.079 --> 51:00.679
He's not here.

51:02.199 --> 51:04.599
- I have talk to him.
- Nothing to talk about.

51:04.599 --> 51:06.960
I have nothing to say to you.
Where is he?

51:06.960 --> 51:08.920
You're an idiot. Don't you see?

51:08.920 --> 51:12.960
Spain is lost, and Don Jaime
is the only one who can save us.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.840
By kidnapping innocent people?

51:14.840 --> 51:16.960
Rodero isn't innocent,
he's a commie.

51:16.960 --> 51:20.960
- He's a commie!
- Feli was innocent!

51:20.960 --> 51:22.800
What have you done with Rodero?

51:24.559 --> 51:26.039
Cut off his thumbs.

51:27.320 --> 51:30.360
What? I saw it on a show.
And the guy told everything.

51:33.280 --> 51:38.599
- So you're actually going to do it?
- Wait, stop, stop! Rodero is fine.

51:38.599 --> 51:41.159
"We only tortured him
a little bit" fine?

51:41.159 --> 51:44.960
No, why? He had nothing to do
with the Captain's kidnapping.

51:44.960 --> 51:48.360
So why have me kidnap him?
Where do you have him, Benito?

51:50.880 --> 51:53.000
In a closed children's playground.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.440
- At the entrance of Pozuelo.
- Shall we go?

51:58.519 --> 52:01.639
Or... are you going to kill him?

52:01.639 --> 52:06.840
I'm not looking for revenge but
tell your boss that this isn't over.

52:06.840 --> 52:10.159
Well, a little bit of revenge
sounds good to me.

52:37.280 --> 52:41.599
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Move aside.

52:53.679 --> 52:55.480
Antonia!

53:10.800 --> 53:12.840
Mr. Rodero?

53:16.480 --> 53:18.760
He must have been drugged,
like you were.

53:23.079 --> 53:24.840
Antonia!

53:37.000 --> 53:39.960
Fuck!

53:41.320 --> 53:42.800
Fuck! No!

53:42.800 --> 53:47.039
- It's the Captain. God, she's dead!
- They've set a trap for us, Antonia.

53:47.039 --> 53:49.760
- Let's go! Let's go!
- No. There's no time.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.840
Let them come in.
You beat them up and we escape.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.519
- I'm not going to hit anyone.
- So what do we do?

53:55.519 --> 53:57.599
- Wait and let them arrest us?
- Exactly.

53:57.599 --> 53:59.199
But...

54:25.360 --> 54:31.320
<i>...here it is, a Spanish classic,
Radio Futura.</i>

54:58.239 --> 55:03.280
<i>- Who are you?
- A dead man. An avalanche is coming.</i>

55:03.280 --> 55:06.440
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Here, this way!</i>

55:06.440 --> 55:10.840
<i>Hands up!</i>
