01:01.520 --> 01:02.521
Lord arai.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.744
- Lord arai.
- Lord arai.

01:18.913 --> 01:19.914
Lord arai.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.673
Lord arai.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.927
Lord arai.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.693
Lord arai.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.194
Right this way.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.635
You're early.

02:14.719 --> 02:15.970
You're on time.

02:16.679 --> 02:18.306
Very samurai of you.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.891
Welcome to the house of arai.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.686
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.564
I've never been in the presence
of a witch before.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.566
I figured it was urgent,

02:28.649 --> 02:32.653
since we are breaking
a 300-year-old protocol.

02:32.737 --> 02:37.366
But I must say, I never expected
the house of arai to be here,

02:37.450 --> 02:38.993
so far from home.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.494
Well, despite its appearances,

02:40.578 --> 02:42.663
Budapest is the crossroads
of east and west.

02:42.747 --> 02:44.457
Setting up here is...

02:44.540 --> 02:45.958
Unnecessary?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.672
Well, times have changed, hirano.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.009
We have both adapted to survive.

02:59.597 --> 03:00.598
Sake?

03:11.275 --> 03:12.610
Sake.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.116
To trust.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.377
So, what is this pressing matter?

03:30.628 --> 03:37.093
Yurei is here,
and he intends to destroy all samurai.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.177
But it can't be.

03:38.260 --> 03:42.264
And I fear betrayal from one of our own.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.350
We need your help, hirano.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.727
- With what?
- The tengu sword.

03:47.812 --> 03:48.896
What?

03:49.522 --> 03:51.315
The tengu sword was split,

03:51.399 --> 03:54.610
so neither samurai nor witch
could abuse its power.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.903
We have to unite them again.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.531
And yurei knows that
if we unite the sword,

03:58.614 --> 04:00.241
it's the only thing that can stop him.

04:01.075 --> 04:04.829
If that were true,
then he'll come after us.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.665
And even more reason
we should never be in the same place.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.584
Uniting the sword is not the answer.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.003
If you can't protect your warrior blade,

04:14.338 --> 04:15.923
then pass it on to another descendant.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.426
What you suggested is no longer an option.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.665
Yurei has killed all the others.

04:22.388 --> 04:25.641
I am the last descendant of the 47 Ronin.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.189
Suppose I believe you.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.151
Are you saying
if I give you the witch blade,

04:35.234 --> 04:37.027
you intend to fulfill the prophecy?

04:39.780 --> 04:43.451
We can unite the blade,
and we can fulfill it.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.703
Together.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.121
Trust, hirano.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.292
The future of our two people
can begin in this room

04:51.375 --> 04:52.918
if we work together.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.550
How good is your magic?

05:03.512 --> 05:04.930
How good is your sword?

05:06.098 --> 05:07.516
Let's find out.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.712
Yurei.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.706
Sorry about your friend.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.611
The last descendant.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.114
It must be hard carrying all that weight.

08:09.198 --> 08:14.495
Your whole life predetermined
just because of your blood.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.705
Go fuck yourself.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.386
I still feel it.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.847
There's another.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.221
Ooh!

09:56.305 --> 09:58.974
Sorry. Annoying tourist. Sorry.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.646
Of course his name is Richard.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.543
Oh, look. It's the geishas.
Anyone need a coffee run?

11:07.626 --> 11:08.794
Onami.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.339
Oh, uh... lord nikko.

11:45.956 --> 11:46.957
Lord okoro.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.334
Lord maeda.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.795
Lord shinshiro.

11:52.588 --> 11:53.589
Lord nikko.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.218
As you all know,
the house of arai has fallen.

11:58.886 --> 12:02.180
Lord arai was a brother to us all.

12:02.264 --> 12:06.602
We must investigate what happened
and figure out our next moves.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.687
What's there to investigate?

12:08.770 --> 12:10.230
Arai is dead.

12:10.314 --> 12:13.108
Yurei and hirano are of the same blood.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.738
Arai made a big mistake trusting a witch.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.283
Unless hirano was betrayed as well.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.202
Why would yurei kill one of his own?

12:25.746 --> 12:29.750
Maybe hirano refused to give up
the witch blade.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.253
Whatever happened between arai and hirano,

12:33.337 --> 12:36.048
we still have to contend with
the prophecy.

12:36.798 --> 12:41.511
The blade of the 47 Ronin,
fortified by magic and valor,

12:42.012 --> 12:46.642
will be wielded by a true descendant
to defeat an evil borne from the past.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.436
Arai was the last descendant.

12:49.519 --> 12:53.523
He died, and the prophecy died with him.

12:53.607 --> 12:57.152
The record keeper has seen another
who can fulfill it.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.780
Lord ikeda, are you still seeking counsel

12:59.863 --> 13:03.367
from flimsy fortune tellers
and charlatans?

13:03.450 --> 13:04.451
Come on.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.079
Some of us respect our sacred traditions.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.416
The keeper had a vision
of another descendant.

13:12.918 --> 13:17.547
A young amefican woman
here to col/act her lhher/z'ance.

13:18.423 --> 13:22.511
He saw the warrior blade in her hands.

13:25.222 --> 13:28.725
You put your faith
in an outsider, lord shinshiro?

13:28.809 --> 13:30.978
Oh, and a woman, no less.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.231
Samurai blood is strong.

13:34.314 --> 13:39.361
But sharing blood doesn't mean
she's bound to our cause.

13:39.444 --> 13:43.323
We need to convince her
to honor lord arai's legacy.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.995
"Honor."

13:48.537 --> 13:52.207
I lost a good friend, lord shinshiro.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.668
A brother, huh?

13:54.751 --> 13:59.297
So you talk about honor. Uh-uh.
I am here to avenge him!

14:00.382 --> 14:01.383
Avenge.

14:02.551 --> 14:07.597
So, while you were busy, uh,
reading scrolls...

14:08.682 --> 14:11.768
My clan invested in
modern weaponry, hmm?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.730
We can protect ourselves

14:14.813 --> 14:17.190
by finding and destroying the blade.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.234
But we have sworn to protect it.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.904
Keep your strays in line, lord shinshiro.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.073
My apologies.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.583
But if brute force were the solution,

14:35.459 --> 14:39.546
we would not have devoted lifetimes
to the prophecy.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.340
Guns do not defeat magic.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.886
Let us take this evening
to think about it.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.056
We can put it to a vote tomorrow.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.854
Well, I hope you all will
come around by then.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.781
Three, two, one, go!

15:12.162 --> 15:14.706
- Whose face are you picturing?
- No one's.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.585
Fucking nikko
and his cocksucking bully.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.921
Oh, so that's why you are so distracted.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.425
I'm not distracted.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.514
Look, here's a delicate situation.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.797
Oh, a delicate situation?
Yeah, let's blow this shit up!

15:34.518 --> 15:36.103
Onami, that's not the answer.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.313
I'm just gonna find
the last descendant myself.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.273
- Oh, no. She's plotting.
- She'd better not,

15:40.357 --> 15:42.317
'cause lord nikko
wants her to stay out of it.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.321
Yes, as geisha,
we give the men what they want.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.366
We're onna-buge/sha.
Anything men can kill, we can kill better.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.288
Stop provoking her,
or she'll end up like reo.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.836
Reo was protecting me. He was set up.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.424
Maybe, but he's a Ronin now.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.096
Oh, my gosh. Mai.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.351
He can help me track down the descendant.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.563
You think reo would still help
even after being kicked out?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.940
Yeah. Reo's a great tracker,
and he wants back in.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.234
Oh, yeah. He would do anything for you.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.572
I tagged our prophecy girl.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.368
Tracking strangers seems highly illegal.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.246
She didn't feel me tag her,
so it's not my problem.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.791
Besides, we're in
the criminal crossroads of the world.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.169
Budapest once had
a bad reputation for smuggling,

17:24.252 --> 17:26.606
- but certain clans have histori...
- Spare me the history lesson.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.215
God, you were never any fun.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.382
You never listen.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.634
- Know-it-all.
- Deviant.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.010
- Teacher's pet.
- Flake.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.387
Are you out past your curfew?

17:35.931 --> 17:37.015
Come here.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.393
Admit it. You missed me, didn't you?

17:40.477 --> 17:41.811
Shut up.

17:43.271 --> 17:46.149
Look at you, all grown up and shit.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.987
- How'd you find her?
- Oh, straight to business then?

17:51.071 --> 17:54.532
No "hi, reo. It's good to see you!
I missed you! I'm so glad you're alive"?

17:55.325 --> 17:56.326
Geez.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.079
These boring-ass samurai
have been clearly rubbing off on you.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.413
You mock them,

18:00.497 --> 18:03.583
and yet you secretly follow them
to their emergency summit?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.377
Listen, I'm just looking out for you.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.837
And the old man.

18:09.714 --> 18:10.757
How is shinshiro?

18:11.883 --> 18:13.218
He misses you.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.427
Yeah, right.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.848
Luckily for you, I come bearing intel.

18:18.932 --> 18:19.933
Hey, Rachel.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.019
One reo special
and whatever she's having.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.813
I'm not here to drink.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.232
Make that two.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.984
- Sure thing.
- So, listen,

18:29.067 --> 18:31.403
me and the record keeper, we're like this.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.573
Well, we've never really met in person,
but other than that, like this.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.285
So I asked him about this prophecy girl.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.246
Turns out she's got
quite the background check.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.748
We should probably engage
before she gets thrown in jail.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.543
Our prophecy rests in the hands
of a criminal?

18:46.626 --> 18:49.212
Hey, now, let's give her a chance.
Former criminal.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.716
Who's been trying to hock
some shady goods in a hurry.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.176
She wants to sell
an ancient legacy for a quick buck?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.721
Hey, student debt gives no fucks.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.639
Why here?

18:59.723 --> 19:02.100
Do you know how much
these people will pay for collectibles?

19:02.183 --> 19:05.186
Look, the record keeper hacked
her emails and found a deal she made

19:05.270 --> 19:08.773
for an online buyer
looking for an ancient samurai artifact.

19:08.857 --> 19:09.983
As a matter of fact...

19:12.944 --> 19:14.112
Deal's going down right now.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.490
Nero on fire?

19:23.747 --> 19:24.998
Is that shit stolen?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.250
You don't even know me like that.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.502
This is actually the one thing
I legally acquired.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.883
I'll come back later.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.010
Dude! What the fuck?

19:37.093 --> 19:38.428
Oh, shit. She's on the move.

19:42.557 --> 19:43.892
Let's cut her off.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.660
Oh, fuck!

20:44.494 --> 20:45.703
Stop running!

21:17.068 --> 21:18.708
- You need to listen.
- Onami.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.738
Uncle.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.243
So oddly muscular.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.327
Reo?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.122
Lord shinshiro.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.754
Of all my apprentices, I chose only
the Anna-buge/sha to join this trip.

21:36.838 --> 21:41.134
To follow and observe this mission,
not recklessly lead your own.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.637
But I found her...
The last descendant of the 47.

21:46.055 --> 21:49.017
That was never your responsibility.
You should have come to me.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.978
Or have I lost your trust?

21:53.188 --> 21:54.397
I'm sorry.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.900
Yo, does anyone wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

21:56.983 --> 21:59.235
- Language.
- I tried to explain. You wouldn't listen.

21:59.319 --> 22:02.947
Yeah, I typically don't stop and listen to
people chasing me with swords, asshole.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.908
- Language!
- You'rejust mad I had you.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.702
Keep telling yourself that,
knockoff Hermione Granger.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.704
- We were trying to save your life.
- _iiwell?

22:15.502 --> 22:17.462
Who the hell are these freaks anyway?

22:19.589 --> 22:24.511
These freaks were sent to stop you
from fulfilling an ancient prophecy.

22:24.594 --> 22:28.181
Look, I don't know what kind of con
you guys are running. Respect, but pass.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.687
I am lord shinshiro.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.523
May I ask your name?

22:38.066 --> 22:39.234
Oh, uh...

22:39.317 --> 22:42.320
Sorry that I didn't introduce myself,
lord shinshiro.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.322
Um, I am lord go fuck yourself.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.076
Her name's Luna.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.332
Luna.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.001
Did you collect your father's sword?

23:00.338 --> 23:02.006
Why? What's it worth to you guys?

23:03.591 --> 23:05.385
Your father was samurai.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.303
One of the best.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.889
A man with a great destiny.

23:09.973 --> 23:13.893
Charming story about the guy
who knocked up my mom and ditched us.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.020
Do you guys wanna bid
on the blade or what?

23:16.104 --> 23:18.439
That blade is worth more
than money could buy.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.942
Wow. Okay. Price just went up.

23:21.025 --> 23:24.487
Luna, there is a lot about your family
that you need to know.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.156
But not here.
We can talk at the safe house.

23:27.240 --> 23:31.578
I'm definitely not following you
to a second location, dude.

23:31.661 --> 23:35.206
Luna, you need protection.
You cannot be on your own.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.083
Well, I've been on my own for years,

23:37.166 --> 23:39.836
so I don't think I need the protection
of a John wick fanboy.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.220
- We should go.
- What the fuck?

23:49.304 --> 23:50.888
Language.

23:53.391 --> 23:54.642
You...

23:54.726 --> 23:55.935
Just... just come with me.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.521
We're just gonna leave
a beheaded dude on the ground?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.588
I am sorry.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.010
For what?

25:12.470 --> 25:14.514
You had to do what you had to do.

25:18.559 --> 25:24.899
Maybe I needed to learn the hard way
how to keep my temper in check.

25:26.859 --> 25:31.614
Lord nikko's pupil baited you,
and now he picks on onami.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.368
Small men pick on easy targets.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.206
Small men pick on those
who do not yet know their own power.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.168
They hope to snuff out your light
before it outshines them.

25:51.175 --> 25:55.263
I will not let that same mistake
happen twice.

26:02.854 --> 26:04.522
What the hell is this place?

26:04.605 --> 26:06.190
It's a samurai safe house.

26:06.858 --> 26:10.194
Each family has their own
underground network across the world.

26:10.278 --> 26:12.071
Wow. Fancy.

26:13.364 --> 26:17.243
Has this place got a bathroom,
or should I just go piss in a corner?

26:18.327 --> 26:19.787
Follow me.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.457
What are you, my po?
Just tell me where it is.

26:23.249 --> 26:26.127
What, you think ninja are gonna
ambush me in the bathroom?

26:28.129 --> 26:30.715
Have you been ambushed
by a ninja in the bathroom?

26:47.815 --> 26:49.066
Jesus!

26:49.150 --> 26:52.236
Ninja are patient, relentless.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.615
In ancient times, they'd infiltrate
entire families for decades

26:55.698 --> 26:57.825
just to strike when least expected.

26:57.909 --> 27:00.119
Okay, well,
thank you for the history lesson.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.664
I'm just making sure you stay alive
to fulfill the prophecy.

27:03.748 --> 27:06.083
Oh, I haven't agreed to anything yet.

27:07.001 --> 27:10.630
You know, your legacy is a privilege
some of us would kill for,

27:10.713 --> 27:12.799
and you're treating it like shit.

27:12.882 --> 27:15.343
If you want this blade so bad,
just buy it from me.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.513
Buy it? We need you to wield it.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.182
First, we have to make it to the vote.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.811
Hurry up. It'll be daybreak soon.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.981
- You got something right there.
- Aw, thanks, Princess.

27:55.258 --> 27:56.551
Isn't that lord okoro?

27:56.634 --> 27:58.362
It appears to be lockdown protocol.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.930
Do you think they would attack
a hotel full of samurai?

28:01.013 --> 28:02.056
Who's "they"?

28:02.139 --> 28:05.226
- They probably discovered our location.
- Who the fuck is "they"?

28:05.309 --> 28:06.769
- Ninja!
- Language!

28:08.354 --> 28:10.773
You know what? Screw this.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.110
You gotta be kidding me.

28:15.236 --> 28:17.321
Thank you for meeting me early.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.454
What's on your mind?

28:26.163 --> 28:30.543
I'm concerned with your perspective
on the future of the samurai.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.464
You asked to meet early to tell me that?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.758
-I think we should... 4keda.

28:37.842 --> 28:42.054
However the vote goes, I trust it will be
for the greater good of all samurai.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.643
You can't just go off on your own.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.271
You said I'd be safer with your crew,
and clearly I'm not.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.356
- Come with us.
- No. I'm out.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.649
Getting a cab to the airport.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.711
There's no place that's safe
while you have the blade.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.975
- Are you always this dramatic?
- We're trying to save...

28:59.822 --> 29:01.324
Holy shit.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.791
We need to get you to safety.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.710
Please, just listen to me.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.271
Protect her at all costs.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.266
Who are you?

31:26.969 --> 31:28.596
Luna! Let's go!

31:32.099 --> 31:33.601
Think you broke it, dude.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.561
Vvhoo!

31:54.455 --> 31:55.456
Ikeda?

32:42.294 --> 32:43.295
Keeper is here?

32:43.379 --> 32:44.672
Are you sure?

32:44.755 --> 32:47.550
No, I just love
creepy abandoned warehouses.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.886
Relax. The clans rented this space
while they're in town.

32:51.887 --> 32:56.392
What the fu... frick is a keeper?

32:56.475 --> 32:59.436
The record keepers are an ancient group
of samurai prophets.

33:00.020 --> 33:04.233
They preserve the records of history
and see glimpses of the future.

33:04.316 --> 33:08.904
Oh, okay. But this one's home base
is just where high-school kids score weed.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.991
We should head to a safe house.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.119
We will, but we need some answers first.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.079
Be aware.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.623
- Remember?
- I remember her, yeah.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.625
Dude, uh, yeah. Crazy.

33:32.553 --> 33:36.056
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt
your energy drink commercial,

33:36.140 --> 33:38.225
but we're looking for a guy named dash.

33:39.018 --> 33:41.353
- Whoa, Jesus!
- You must be the bodyguard.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.152
We're looking for the keeper.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.529
My apologies, lord shinshiro.

33:52.448 --> 33:53.616
Follow me.

Yep. I'm dash.

34:55.135 --> 34:59.473
And this is my mobile record room.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.309
Home to all your spy...

35:02.393 --> 35:04.144
Hacking...

35:04.228 --> 35:05.437
Researching needs.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.231
I'm reo.

35:07.314 --> 35:08.565
This place is sick.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.403

35:41.098 --> 35:42.850
Ooh.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.564
You must be prophecy girl.

35:49.523 --> 35:52.901
Yeah, yeah. I would love if...
If you could tell me what that means.

35:52.985 --> 35:57.323
The blade of the 47 Ronin,
fortified by magic and valor,

35:57.406 --> 36:01.994
will be wielded by a true descendant
to defeat an evil borne from the past.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.872
Am I supposed to know
what any of that means?

36:04.955 --> 36:08.375
You see,
prophecies are kinda tricky to interpret.

36:08.459 --> 36:11.211
For instance, the valor part.

36:12.171 --> 36:15.883
The tengu sword is the witch blade
and the warrior blade fused together.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.218
You have the warrior blade.

36:18.302 --> 36:20.429
We're searching for the witch blade.

36:21.472 --> 36:22.473
Okay.

36:22.556 --> 36:23.599
And the...

36:23.682 --> 36:26.352
The "evil borne from the past" part,
is that onami?

36:27.811 --> 36:28.854
That's yurei.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.481
He's the descendant of mizuki.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.692
She was the witch slain by Kai.

36:33.776 --> 36:36.111
One of the original 47 Ronin.

36:36.195 --> 36:40.949
And you, Luna,
are the last descendant of the 47

36:41.033 --> 36:43.452
and the only one who can kill yurei.

36:43.535 --> 36:47.581
Okay, let's just pretend for a second
that I believe any of this.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.584
How do you guys know
that you have the right person, right?

36:50.667 --> 36:54.129
This sounds pretty important.
How do you know I am the last descendant?

36:54.713 --> 36:55.714
Because I've seen it.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.439
Uh...

37:13.607 --> 37:15.150
Dude, are you okay? Are you...

37:15.234 --> 37:20.364
On the next blood moon,
yurei will unite the two blades,

37:20.447 --> 37:23.242
which will unleash
the full power of his magic.

37:23.826 --> 37:29.957
He won't stop until the bloodline
of the 47 Ronin is extinguished

37:30.040 --> 37:32.626
and all samurai are destroyed.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.298
Here.

37:39.675 --> 37:43.929
O-Okay, what... what if we melt it down?
Right? Then nobody can get to it.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.890
That is impossible.
Only magic can reshape it.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.434
Which gives us two choices.

37:48.517 --> 37:51.603
Either you fulfill the prophecy
and kill yurei with the united blades or...

37:51.687 --> 37:53.939
Or he kills me. Yeah.

37:54.022 --> 37:58.193
And then nothing will stop him
from wiping out all samurai.

38:01.905 --> 38:02.906
Okay.

38:03.532 --> 38:07.619
So if I understand correctly,
we just have to find this witch blade,

38:07.703 --> 38:09.329
unite it with the one I have,

38:09.413 --> 38:12.666
and murder this yurei guy
before the next blood moon.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.461
- When is that?
- Five days.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.132
From... from now?

38:22.885 --> 38:24.970
My flight leaves in two, so...

38:33.353 --> 38:35.314
- Oh, I'm starving.
- Mmm.

38:48.285 --> 38:51.121
I'm not able to get in touch
with any of the other lords.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.792
All their trackers are offline.

38:56.543 --> 38:57.544
Except for yours.

39:02.049 --> 39:03.258
You put a tracker on me?

39:03.342 --> 39:05.677
- Thought it'd be a good idea...
- You didn't ask!

39:08.847 --> 39:10.766
Where is it? Take...

39:20.859 --> 39:22.402
Maybe that's a good thing.

39:29.451 --> 39:30.869
You did good, reo.

39:38.210 --> 39:39.211
Thank you.

39:45.092 --> 39:48.804
Nikko's tracker went down at the hotel,
right as the attack went down.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.556
Maybe he didn't make it out.

39:51.974 --> 39:53.976
Do you think the ninja got them all?

39:54.059 --> 39:57.020
Hopefully it's just that
their safe houses block my tracker.

39:57.646 --> 40:00.524
We should stay here
and call for reinforcements.

40:00.607 --> 40:03.569
We cannot leave
the prime houses unprotected.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.029
What if that's what yurei wants?

40:08.532 --> 40:12.619
Lure us to our safe house,
so he can strike us all down like arai?

40:14.997 --> 40:16.748
I'll search for the lords myself.

40:18.709 --> 40:21.962
Then they will help us
hunt for the witch blade.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.797
We should stay together.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.360
- Take the fight to yurei.
- She's not ready for the fight yet.

40:31.305 --> 40:34.308
Do you think she will learn
how to swing a sword in five days?

40:34.391 --> 40:35.392
Yes.

40:37.185 --> 40:39.730
She will learn
because she will have a great master.

40:43.942 --> 40:44.943
You.

40:48.405 --> 40:50.699
No way. I'm just an apprentice.

40:50.782 --> 40:51.783
Not anymore.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.287
You have been leading this mission
the whole time.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.123
Now it is official.

41:01.543 --> 41:04.504
And you will help train Luna as well.

41:06.757 --> 41:09.384
So, you're leaving me in charge?

41:10.052 --> 41:11.887
I'll be back as soon as I can.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.307
- But it's too dangerous to go alone.
- I'll be fine.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.100
I'll clear the safe houses.

41:17.184 --> 41:19.561
You can use them, but don't stay too long.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.688
Keep the warrior blade on the move.

41:23.273 --> 41:26.234
So if you're putting me in charge,
then I say you take bodyguards.

41:29.279 --> 41:30.614
One bodyguard.

41:31.365 --> 41:33.408
Fine. Mai?

41:34.326 --> 41:35.327
Let's do it.

41:51.802 --> 41:52.802
Uncle!

41:57.974 --> 41:59.267
Be careful.

42:15.867 --> 42:16.868
You too.

42:43.228 --> 42:46.273
If I do well in training,
do I have to dress like onami?

42:46.356 --> 42:48.066
Don't worry. You'll never do that well.

42:52.821 --> 42:55.574
- What, you don't know the code?
- He must have changed it.

42:55.657 --> 42:57.409
How the hell are we supposed to get in?

42:57.492 --> 42:59.595
All right.
Looks like we go analog on this one.

42:59.619 --> 43:03.039
- We are not breaking in.
- You got a better idea, Cho Chang?

43:03.123 --> 43:06.543
We don't have time for this shit.
Just let her do her thing.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.921
Fine.

43:23.894 --> 43:24.895
Nice.

43:25.896 --> 43:26.897
You're welcome.

43:27.606 --> 43:31.193
Before you can strike,
you must be able to listen.

43:31.985 --> 43:33.862
Ninja live in the darkness.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.447
They thrive in it.

43:35.530 --> 43:39.618
They will strike from the shadows,
so you must learn to hear them coming.

43:40.786 --> 43:43.705
By the time you see them,
it will already be too late.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.920
All right. Your turn.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.090
Just stick with the stabs.

43:54.174 --> 43:55.175
Very simple, ladies.

43:55.258 --> 43:57.385
First one to hand it to me wins.

43:57.469 --> 43:59.721
Three, two, one, go.

44:03.058 --> 44:04.100
Take a deep breath.

44:04.184 --> 44:06.245
What do you hear?

44:06.269 --> 44:08.188
Dude, I hear five o'clock traffic.

44:08.772 --> 44:10.649
- Are you listening?
- I am trying.

44:10.732 --> 44:14.903
You must hear through the noise
and listen to what is really important.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.906
I just hear angry Hungarian people.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.866
How are you the answer to our problems?

44:25.831 --> 44:27.082
Are you listening?

44:27.165 --> 44:29.209
Dude, that blew out my eardrum.

44:29.292 --> 44:31.545
My arms tensed, reared back and swung.

44:31.628 --> 44:33.630
Plenty of warning
if you were truly listening.

44:35.799 --> 44:36.800
Not bad.

44:39.511 --> 44:40.512
Damn.

44:41.137 --> 44:42.931
That samurai blood is no joke.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.891
Pretty sure it's the new yorker side.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.185
- What the hell?
- Heard that one?

44:47.269 --> 44:50.021
Yeah, I heard her sword
go straight for my trachea.

44:51.731 --> 44:54.025
You heard the blade cut through the air.

44:54.109 --> 44:56.027
But did you hear the scabbard shift?

44:56.611 --> 44:58.113
The sword slide?

44:58.989 --> 45:02.200
What's it me, anyway?
Being a real samurai?

45:02.993 --> 45:05.203
- I'm actually a Ronin.
- What's that?

45:05.287 --> 45:08.707
A masterless samurai. It's what happens
when you break one rule too many.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.668
Three, two, one, go.

45:19.467 --> 45:23.013
Guess we can't all be
prim and proper Japanese princesses, huh?

45:23.096 --> 45:24.973
Onami's more like us than you think.

45:26.057 --> 45:29.394
Shinshiro found her as a baby
and he raised her as if she was his own,

45:29.477 --> 45:31.229
but nobody knows her ancestry,

45:31.313 --> 45:35.609
so no matter how hard she tries,
the clans will never acknowledge her.

45:40.238 --> 45:42.574
Three. Four.

45:43.950 --> 45:44.951
Five.

45:45.952 --> 45:46.953
Six.

46:18.944 --> 46:19.945
Two.

46:24.741 --> 46:25.742
Three.

46:27.744 --> 46:28.745
Foun

46:44.427 --> 46:48.181
So, when are you gonna show me that cool
spin kick you did at the cosplay party?

46:48.264 --> 46:51.184
- You don't need to know that. Focus.
- Come on.

46:52.727 --> 46:55.271
There are no points for fancy shit
in a real battle.

46:55.355 --> 46:57.732
Oh. Okay, so you admit it.
You think it's fancy.

47:02.570 --> 47:05.448
Man, being a samurai
is a lot of repetitive drills.

47:06.199 --> 47:08.910
Actually, the term "samurai"
is used only for men.

47:08.994 --> 47:10.286
We're onna-bugeisha.

47:10.370 --> 47:11.538
What?

47:11.621 --> 47:14.582
But you train like samurai,
and you live like samurai.

47:15.792 --> 47:17.252
Tell me about it.

47:19.462 --> 47:20.463
Hmm.

47:43.153 --> 47:44.320
Thanks.

47:44.404 --> 47:45.780
You have beautiful eyes.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.590
Damn, dude. Can you be any louder?

48:03.673 --> 48:05.300
I should actually be even louder.

48:05.383 --> 48:08.553
Haven't you seen
that '80s ramen western, tampopo?

48:08.636 --> 48:11.097
- No.
- What? It's a classic.

48:11.806 --> 48:16.311
Slurping is a sign of respect,
and ramen is real-life art.

48:16.895 --> 48:17.896
Mmm.

48:17.979 --> 48:20.023
Smell the broth.

48:20.106 --> 48:21.149
Mmm.

48:21.232 --> 48:24.277
Notice that seaweed
just perfectly laying on top there?

48:25.445 --> 48:26.738
Now, the chicken...

48:28.364 --> 48:30.909
Before I eat it, I massage it,

48:31.785 --> 48:33.078
I acknowledge it,

48:33.828 --> 48:34.954
I thank it,

48:35.663 --> 48:37.332
and I apologize to it.

48:39.501 --> 48:43.004
- I'm sorry, chicken.
- That's why I'm a vegetarian, dude.

48:43.088 --> 48:45.215
Aya says dash has a lead
on the witch blade.

48:45.298 --> 48:46.841
We should start heading back soon.

48:47.634 --> 48:48.927
- You mean now?
- Yeah, now.

48:49.010 --> 48:51.304
- But I just started.
- Oh, my gosh. Come on.

48:51.387 --> 48:53.107
- Fine.
- Let's go. Nope. Let's go.

49:01.397 --> 49:02.398
Oh, shit.

49:03.358 --> 49:04.901
I gotta order a burger.

49:04.984 --> 49:06.986
Are you fucking serious?
We don't have time.

49:07.070 --> 49:09.550
- Luna.
- There's no line. I'll get it to go.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.286
What is it?

49:16.454 --> 49:19.374
I don't know. I think...
I think someone's following us.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.209
Where? I don't see anybody.

49:27.590 --> 49:29.050
He was just there.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.178
Told you it was a bad idea to come here.

49:32.262 --> 49:34.305
Will you quit being paranoid?
Nobody's following us.

49:34.389 --> 49:35.890
We shouldn't have listened to you.

49:35.974 --> 49:37.684
- We gotta get outta here. Now.
- Let's go.

49:42.063 --> 49:44.858
Sorry.
I thought I was gonna have it that time.

49:45.775 --> 49:49.696
Maybe I can't see the witch blade
because of its protective spell.

49:49.779 --> 49:50.780
Mmm.

49:51.656 --> 49:55.785
Good news is, if I can't find it,
yurei probably can't either.

49:57.453 --> 50:00.206
- I think we're being followed.
- We went to the food market.

50:00.832 --> 50:04.002
How could you be so irresponsible?
You are supposed to be in charge.

50:04.085 --> 50:06.754
- It was my idea. Blame me.
- Sorry, we don't have time for this.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.299
Do you really think
our location is compromised?

50:09.382 --> 50:11.759
We can't wait to find out.
Do you have a backup hideout?

50:11.843 --> 50:14.137
House of arai set up hideouts
all over the city.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.264
Perfect. It's not like
they're using them anymore.

50:20.810 --> 50:21.895
Too soon.

50:22.645 --> 50:24.022
I see that now.

50:25.773 --> 50:27.525
May they rest in peace.

50:35.033 --> 50:36.784
Dash and Luna, hang back with me.

50:44.292 --> 50:45.293
Clear!

50:50.506 --> 50:51.507
Clear.

50:55.428 --> 50:56.429
Clear.

50:58.806 --> 50:59.807
Clear.

51:01.851 --> 51:04.520
I'm trying to update lord shinshiro
on our movement,

51:04.604 --> 51:06.189
but he isn't answering.

51:06.272 --> 51:07.815
I'll check the tracker.

51:07.899 --> 51:10.610
Hey, Luna, can I ask you a favor?

51:10.693 --> 51:11.819
Sure.

51:18.952 --> 51:21.579
While the action figures are busy, I...

51:25.250 --> 51:26.668
Could use your help.

51:29.212 --> 51:32.215
I've uncovered some history
on the witch blade's protectors,

51:32.298 --> 51:35.885
but nothing's triggering a vision
about where it could be hidden now.

51:35.969 --> 51:37.220
Mmm.

51:37.303 --> 51:41.516
Since your father was
the warrior blade's protector,

51:41.599 --> 51:47.897
I thought maybe something in your family
history mightjump out as a connection.

51:49.148 --> 51:51.067
Dude, I don't know shit about my dad.

51:53.736 --> 51:59.742
I could always just study
your warrior blade for a couple hours.

52:03.871 --> 52:05.999
Yeah, I... I don't know.

52:06.082 --> 52:07.083
Okay, never mind.

52:07.166 --> 52:09.377
Um... do you mind?

52:13.506 --> 52:16.134
It should cover your family tree.

52:16.217 --> 52:19.304
Arrest records, news clippings,

52:19.804 --> 52:21.472
birth certificate.

52:23.182 --> 52:25.184
Let me know if something clicks for you.

52:30.023 --> 52:31.733
Well, this is my mom.

52:33.276 --> 52:34.777
She had a beautiful name.

52:36.362 --> 52:37.363
Yeah.

52:38.156 --> 52:39.157
Nita.

52:43.619 --> 52:45.496
You know,
I used to have this photo of her.

52:46.789 --> 52:49.000
But after she died, I kinda just...

52:50.835 --> 52:52.295
Left everything behind.

53:00.136 --> 53:01.387
You can keep that tablet.

53:04.390 --> 53:06.642
Are you sure? This is, like, 1200 bucks.

53:09.687 --> 53:10.688
Thanks.

53:16.569 --> 53:19.489
Okay, I'll let you borrow it
for a few hours.

53:22.825 --> 53:24.952
It's the least I can do for $1,200.

53:25.787 --> 53:27.372
I'm gonna need it back.

53:29.749 --> 53:30.750
Okay.

53:41.219 --> 53:43.888
Fuck! Nikko, ikeda, maeda, okoro.

53:43.971 --> 53:47.392
Now lord shinshiro?
How are they all still radio silent?

53:47.475 --> 53:49.894
- Do you think yurei...
- Shinshiro is fine.

53:49.977 --> 53:52.605
They are on a search-and-rescue mission.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.941
They are probably staying off the grid
on purpose.

53:55.024 --> 53:56.424
It's not like him, and you know it.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.504
Did you get a hold of shinshiro?

53:59.654 --> 54:01.739
His tracker's down.

54:02.532 --> 54:04.742
How long have you been trying him?

54:05.576 --> 54:07.370
A few hours.

54:07.453 --> 54:09.163
Hours? We need to find him.

54:09.247 --> 54:12.083
I can check around the city tonight
if that helps.

54:12.166 --> 54:15.086
- Hit up a few of my contacts.
- No. I'm gonna look for him now.

54:17.422 --> 54:18.423
Okay.

54:18.965 --> 54:20.174
Where are we going?

54:20.925 --> 54:24.303
I'll... I'll retrace his steps.
He was headed towards...

54:24.387 --> 54:27.348
Someone was following you,
and you wanna go back out there?

54:27.432 --> 54:30.393
- Shinshiro is missing.
- Your mission is to protect Luna.

54:31.477 --> 54:33.062
Family comes first.

54:36.774 --> 54:37.817
Don't worry.

54:38.317 --> 54:39.527
Everything is...

54:47.618 --> 54:50.455
Okay, witch blade, where are you?

55:09.223 --> 55:10.783
You have the warrior blade.

55:10.850 --> 55:12.369
I told you you are not samurai.

55:12.393 --> 55:14.113
We 're searching for the witch blade.

55:14.187 --> 55:16.731
You're a witch, like me.

55:24.655 --> 55:26.073
He saw me. He saw me.

55:39.504 --> 55:41.047
Find out anything?

55:42.089 --> 55:44.634
Warrior blade. Witch blade.

55:57.146 --> 55:58.231
Luna.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.193
I know you can hear me.

56:03.611 --> 56:05.279
Come to me...

56:11.118 --> 56:13.621
You've turned your back
on your real family.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.207
Your entire lineage were witches.

56:16.290 --> 56:19.835
Your mother and the one
she fell in love with, hirano.

56:19.919 --> 56:21.379
No, you're wrong.

56:22.463 --> 56:23.464
I'm not.

56:23.548 --> 56:25.341
You're not the descendant.

56:25.424 --> 56:27.468
We are the same, Luna.

56:53.619 --> 56:54.620
This is one of the places

56:54.704 --> 56:56.348
shinshiro's tracker came
before going down.

56:56.372 --> 56:58.791
That crest.
This is lord nikko's safe house.

56:58.874 --> 57:00.501
How are we supposed to get in?

57:00.585 --> 57:03.629
I mean, dash is supposed to be tracking us
and doing his nerd thing,

57:03.713 --> 57:05.506
but I don't know where he is.

57:05.590 --> 57:07.466
Come on, dash. Do your nerd thing.

57:09.927 --> 57:12.013
Okay. That fucking hurt.

57:14.557 --> 57:16.976
Now, where's the fucking blade?

57:17.643 --> 57:19.312
Where's your fucking sleeves?

57:28.112 --> 57:29.947
Bingo. That should do it.

57:31.657 --> 57:32.950
Ladies first.

57:37.955 --> 57:39.373
Visitors?

57:39.457 --> 57:40.541
Gag him.

57:59.185 --> 58:00.478
I'm just saying,

58:01.520 --> 58:04.023
nothing good ever comes
out of a hallway this narrow.

58:12.323 --> 58:13.574
Do you think he's here?

58:14.659 --> 58:16.118
I don't think anybody's here.

58:19.163 --> 58:20.456
At least, I hope not.

58:40.101 --> 58:41.268
Did you see anything?

59:04.166 --> 59:07.128
- Shit! There's too many of them.
- What do we do?

59:16.053 --> 59:17.138
Uncle.

59:51.922 --> 59:53.090
Lord shinshiro.

59:54.258 --> 59:55.259
Yurei?

59:55.342 --> 59:57.887
It appears you have someone
who belongs to me.

59:58.512 --> 59:59.805
Her family needs her.

59:59.889 --> 1:00:02.266
Luna is already with her family.

1:00:02.349 --> 1:00:06.353
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
This is the witch blade.

1:00:07.605 --> 1:00:08.814
See the engraving?

1:00:09.607 --> 1:00:12.943
The witch depiction is closer
to the handle than the samurai one.

1:00:13.027 --> 1:00:14.737
I just saw it in a vision.

1:00:15.821 --> 1:00:18.365
But why would arai have it?

1:00:19.408 --> 1:00:20.743
Unless...

1:00:21.786 --> 1:00:23.496
Arai wasn't her father.

1:00:23.579 --> 1:00:24.747
Hirano was.

1:00:26.624 --> 1:00:32.129
Meaning Luna isn't a descendant
of the 47 Ronin.

1:00:33.255 --> 1:00:34.381
She's a witch.

1:00:34.924 --> 1:00:38.302
Luna is not samurai blood.

1:00:41.138 --> 1:00:42.473
She is mine.

1:00:44.391 --> 1:00:47.645
You take one of mine, I take one of yours.

1:01:31.730 --> 1:01:33.899
She has to be working with yurei.

1:01:33.983 --> 1:01:35.818
Maybe she doesn't know the truth.

1:01:35.901 --> 1:01:38.445
Or we've all been risking our lives
for a pretender.

1:01:39.113 --> 1:01:40.406
I gotta go eat.

1:02:07.141 --> 1:02:08.392
Lord nikko.

1:02:10.811 --> 1:02:12.688
Get me my fucking sword.

1:02:40.966 --> 1:02:43.469
- Are you okay?
- I have to talk with onami.

1:02:43.552 --> 1:02:45.095
Tell onami what?

1:02:47.056 --> 1:02:48.849
The ninja are already here.

1:02:50.267 --> 1:02:51.602
No.

1:04:52.639 --> 1:04:55.768
Uncle! I gotta get you out of here.

1:05:32.596 --> 1:05:34.056
Oh...

1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:41.730
Onami.

1:05:43.565 --> 1:05:46.860
Ifsu.okay.

1:05:48.362 --> 1:05:49.863
Don't say that.

1:05:51.824 --> 1:05:53.909
I need you.

1:05:55.619 --> 1:05:56.912
And they...

1:05:58.163 --> 1:05:59.832
Need you.

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:07.464
You...

1:06:08.549 --> 1:06:10.676
Have always been...

1:06:12.052 --> 1:06:14.805
A true samurai.

1:06:18.684 --> 1:06:19.768
Lead...

1:06:21.311 --> 1:06:22.479
Them.

1:06:31.989 --> 1:06:34.616
No!

1:06:38.328 --> 1:06:40.914
- 4keda.
- Get them to safety.

1:06:40.998 --> 1:06:43.250
Onami, let's go!

1:06:43.333 --> 1:06:44.459
No! We can't!

1:06:44.543 --> 1:06:46.003
- Now!
- We can't!

1:06:51.049 --> 1:06:52.050
Shinshiro.

1:06:52.551 --> 1:06:54.052
No. Let me go.

1:06:57.181 --> 1:06:58.182
Go! Go!

1:06:59.099 --> 1:07:00.267
Let them go.

1:07:01.435 --> 1:07:03.979
We need them to find the warrior blade.

1:07:57.824 --> 1:07:59.618
Message sent.

1:09:15.819 --> 1:09:18.030
The other lords' houses
are still offline.

1:09:19.948 --> 1:09:22.034
Let's hope the ninja don't find them too.

1:10:22.969 --> 1:10:26.014
I'm so sorry.

1:10:27.307 --> 1:10:29.184
I should have listened to you.

1:10:58.213 --> 1:10:59.589
I'll be in the car.

1:11:01.133 --> 1:11:02.634
Whenever you're ready.

1:11:17.649 --> 1:11:18.900
Did you know

1:11:20.527 --> 1:11:21.987
this whole time?

1:11:24.781 --> 1:11:26.116
I wasn't sure.

1:11:27.868 --> 1:11:30.620
But you have to understand.
My mom, she was a healer.

1:11:30.704 --> 1:11:32.289
She was nothing like yurei.

1:11:32.998 --> 1:11:34.958
Magic is magic.

1:11:35.041 --> 1:11:37.127
- Just like a witch is a witch.
- Onami.

1:11:37.210 --> 1:11:39.129
She doesn't fucking belong here!

1:11:43.216 --> 1:11:44.342
Luna.

1:12:23.632 --> 1:12:24.674
Hey!

1:12:28.220 --> 1:12:29.262
I get it.

1:12:31.723 --> 1:12:34.434
But anger's not gonna get you anywhere.
Trust me.

1:12:37.270 --> 1:12:40.315
I thought all I ever wanted
was to be a samurai.

1:12:40.398 --> 1:12:43.485
But I couldn't even protect my family.

1:12:47.364 --> 1:12:50.116
Your clan, all the samurai,

1:12:51.284 --> 1:12:53.370
they need you now more than ever.

1:12:55.455 --> 1:12:57.082
It is your time to lead.

1:12:58.250 --> 1:12:59.668
Shinshiro believed that.

1:12:59.751 --> 1:13:01.002
I believe that.

1:13:03.380 --> 1:13:04.923
Now, let's go prove him right.

1:13:22.107 --> 1:13:24.401
Do you think there are others like Hana?

1:13:28.405 --> 1:13:31.533
We can't trust anybody
but the people in front of us right now.

1:13:32.701 --> 1:13:35.036
- What do we do now?
- The plan hasn't changed.

1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:38.790
If yurei reunites the tengu sword,
he'll become invincible.

1:13:38.873 --> 1:13:42.544
So the only hope we have left
is finding the actual warrior blade

1:13:42.627 --> 1:13:45.547
and keeping it from him
until after the next blood moon.

1:13:48.049 --> 1:13:50.129
- That's tomorrow.
- Then we still have time.

1:14:17.037 --> 1:14:19.372
Luna, lknow you have some hard feelings,

1:14:19.456 --> 1:14:22.417
but/ wanted you to at least know
your fam/ly's story

1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:25.253
a man named hirano
was actually your father,

1:14:25.337 --> 1:14:29.132
the guardian of the witch blade,
a role inherited in his youth.

1:14:30.091 --> 1:14:32.677
But protecting the sword pro ved
a dangerous task.

1:14:35.096 --> 1:14:38.308
So he enlisted the help of witches
from around the world

1:14:38.391 --> 1:14:40.560
specializing in protective magic.

1:14:41.436 --> 1:14:44.230
He did not expect
to fall in love with a bruja.

1:14:45.398 --> 1:14:48.234
Hirano didn't want his daughter
to inherit his duty,

1:14:48.318 --> 1:14:50.654
so he sent nita and his baby away.

1:14:51.196 --> 1:14:55.075
He would spend the rest of his days alone,
traveling with the blade.

1:14:55.158 --> 1:14:56.493
A moving target.

1:14:58.119 --> 1:14:59.579
Hana betrayed us.

1:14:59.663 --> 1:15:02.165
Warrior blade at the I/iragkert cemetery

1:15:02.248 --> 1:15:03.917
oldestarai grave site.

1:15:06.961 --> 1:15:07.962
Shit!

1:15:08.672 --> 1:15:12.050
- Sorry. Excuse me. Shit. Sorry, sorry.
- Hey, watch it.

1:15:12.133 --> 1:15:13.385
Fuck. My bad.

1:15:22.769 --> 1:15:23.770
- Not mine.
- Not me.

1:15:23.853 --> 1:15:25.397
Definitely not mine.

1:15:26.398 --> 1:15:27.482
It's mine.

1:15:29.984 --> 1:15:31.528
It's from Luna.

1:15:31.611 --> 1:15:32.904
"Viragkert cemetery."

1:15:34.155 --> 1:15:36.074
Looks like she found the warrior blade.

1:15:36.157 --> 1:15:38.493
Dash sent her a message before he died.

1:15:39.744 --> 1:15:42.414
Luna's tablet seems to be moving
towards the cemetery.

1:15:42.497 --> 1:15:43.873
She's going after it.

1:15:43.957 --> 1:15:45.291
You guys go find Luna.

1:15:45.375 --> 1:15:48.169
I'll gather my men and the weapons.
We'll meet later.

1:15:48.253 --> 1:15:49.671
Shinshiro's safe house.

1:16:17.490 --> 1:16:18.992
This looks pretty old.

1:16:30.003 --> 1:16:32.172
God, I hope this is the right grave.

1:17:36.569 --> 1:17:37.904
Join me, Luna.

1:17:39.489 --> 1:17:42.033
I can help you become
what you were meant to be.

1:17:45.078 --> 1:17:49.415
I've known a lot of men like you,
and I've survived just fine without them.

1:17:49.499 --> 1:17:52.669
But with me, you'll have the power
to do more than just survive.

1:17:53.461 --> 1:17:55.797
My magic makes yours stronger.

1:17:56.965 --> 1:17:58.883
You can live a new life.

1:17:58.967 --> 1:18:02.470
A fresh start, where you belong.

1:18:03.346 --> 1:18:05.390
You know, if I was still in my teens,

1:18:06.015 --> 1:18:08.184
my daddy issues would've
eaten that shit up.

1:18:12.730 --> 1:18:15.567
I'll take that, thank you very much.

1:18:24.742 --> 1:18:25.952
We were too late.

1:18:27.996 --> 1:18:30.290
- Don't tell me you failed.
- And your men?

1:18:31.249 --> 1:18:33.751
They've been alerted. It takes time.

1:18:33.835 --> 1:18:35.169
The blood moon is tomorrow,

1:18:35.253 --> 1:18:39.257
and now we have to assume yurei has
both halves of the sword and Luna.

1:18:40.091 --> 1:18:41.593
So we're back to square one.

1:18:42.635 --> 1:18:44.178
I think I might have a lead.

1:18:44.679 --> 1:18:46.723
I'm still tracking Luna's tablet.

1:18:47.307 --> 1:18:49.475
Think yurei doesn't know, huh?

1:18:49.559 --> 1:18:52.937
He'll be waiting for us,
and we're way outnumbered.

1:18:54.355 --> 1:18:55.565
Like it or not,

1:18:55.648 --> 1:18:59.694
we kill yurei tonight, or we die tomorrow.

1:20:01.130 --> 1:20:02.340
They're here.

1:20:03.341 --> 1:20:06.094
Reo, nikko,
take the fight to the next car.

1:20:06.177 --> 1:20:07.971
Kill whatever makes it through us.

1:20:08.054 --> 1:20:09.806
I don't take orders from you.

1:20:12.225 --> 1:20:13.726
But it's not a bad plan.

1:20:50.722 --> 1:20:52.098
Fuck this.

1:21:17.290 --> 1:21:18.833
Whoo!

1:22:43.709 --> 1:22:46.295
Where the fuck are we?

1:22:46.379 --> 1:22:47.672
We're getting off here.

1:22:55.805 --> 1:22:57.265
You sure about this?

1:22:57.348 --> 1:22:58.683
Not really.

1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:00.977
But here goes nothing.

1:23:39.891 --> 1:23:43.060
Soon, the sword's full power will be mine.

1:23:44.228 --> 1:23:46.189
The samurai are on their way.

1:23:46.689 --> 1:23:48.900
It is finally time to destroy them

1:23:49.483 --> 1:23:53.154
and for the ninja to take
our long-overdue seat at the table.

1:23:53.237 --> 1:23:55.072
And you, my ninja brother,

1:23:55.823 --> 1:23:59.035
were the patient rot from within
that made this possible.

1:23:59.535 --> 1:24:01.996
The samurai's arrogance will cost them.

1:24:04.582 --> 1:24:05.750
We should split up.

1:25:07.353 --> 1:25:10.439
It appears your friends have joined
the celebration.

1:25:10.523 --> 1:25:11.941
Come on.

1:25:12.024 --> 1:25:15.069
I came with you.
You said you wouldn't hurt them.

1:25:15.945 --> 1:25:17.989
Another chance to prove your worth.

1:25:18.614 --> 1:25:20.866
Wait. What does that mean? Stop!

1:25:20.950 --> 1:25:22.702
You promised!

1:25:41.846 --> 1:25:44.640
I hope you fight better than your sister.

1:25:49.812 --> 1:25:51.814
Lord nikko must be here somewhere.

1:25:54.025 --> 1:25:55.276
Stay here.

1:26:08.289 --> 1:26:11.375
Some of us respect our sacred traditions.

1:26:12.585 --> 1:26:14.628
Guns do not defeat magic.

1:26:16.505 --> 1:26:19.258
- Get them to safety.
- Go! Go!

1:26:27.892 --> 1:26:30.102
I have to hand it to you, ikeda.

1:26:30.686 --> 1:26:32.104
Faking your own death.

1:26:33.189 --> 1:26:35.232
You're one sneaky bastard.

1:26:39.278 --> 1:26:42.531
I'm gonna cut that pompous tongue
from your mouth.

1:26:52.583 --> 1:26:54.043
About time.

1:26:54.710 --> 1:26:56.337
Thought you were gonna bitch out.

1:26:59.965 --> 1:27:01.675
I'll let my sword do the talking.

1:28:19.211 --> 1:28:21.130
- Where'd he go?
- I didn't see him!

1:28:22.798 --> 1:28:24.133
- Where...
- I didn't see him!

1:28:26.719 --> 1:28:27.719
Cover us!

1:29:22.233 --> 1:29:23.234
Fuck.

1:29:24.401 --> 1:29:26.487
Fuck!

1:29:32.993 --> 1:29:33.994
Shit.

1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:36.330
Where the fuck is he?

1:31:29.985 --> 1:31:31.070
Fuck yeah!

1:31:53.550 --> 1:31:55.010
This is for my sister.

1:32:32.715 --> 1:32:34.341
You can end this now, Luna.

1:32:35.592 --> 1:32:37.553
But you're gonna have to make a decision.

1:32:39.179 --> 1:32:40.305
Them...

1:32:42.182 --> 1:32:43.392
Or your family.

1:34:05.432 --> 1:34:07.684
The sword! Keep it away from him.

1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:33.043
Luna, the sword.

1:35:16.545 --> 1:35:19.339
On behalf of all samurai,

1:35:20.716 --> 1:35:22.301
I send you to hell.

1:36:23.153 --> 1:36:24.947
They must be on the other side. Let's go.

1:36:47.970 --> 1:36:50.472
Here's your fucking sword back!

1:36:53.225 --> 1:36:57.729
I told you you're not the last descendant.
You're a witch, like me.

1:37:23.839 --> 1:37:24.923
Onami!

1:37:31.054 --> 1:37:34.016
Shinshiro found her as a baby
and he raised her as if she was his own.

1:37:34.099 --> 1:37:35.976
Nobody knows her ancestry.

1:37:36.059 --> 1:37:40.272
The blade of the 47 Ronin
will be wielded by a true descendant.

1:37:45.235 --> 1:37:46.235
You.

1:37:47.738 --> 1:37:49.865
You're the one.

1:38:31.198 --> 1:38:33.158
- Holy fuck.
- Yeah.

1:38:37.412 --> 1:38:38.789
Well done.

1:38:40.749 --> 1:38:41.958
We should get going.

1:39:21.706 --> 1:39:23.083
It's cool, man.

1:39:24.501 --> 1:39:25.961
Don't mind if I do.

1:39:28.046 --> 1:39:29.047
Thanks.

1:39:31.424 --> 1:39:34.678
Wow. Ancient magical weapons
look good on you.

1:39:34.761 --> 1:39:38.598
Thanks.
I guess vintage is becoming my thing now.

1:39:40.350 --> 1:39:42.227
Hey, listen, I appreciate the invite,

1:39:42.310 --> 1:39:44.938
but, um, are you sure
you want me in there with you?

1:39:45.522 --> 1:39:46.522
Of course.

1:39:47.858 --> 1:39:49.258
Then I'll follow wherever you lead.

1:39:50.026 --> 1:39:53.029
Hey. You ready?

1:39:53.780 --> 1:39:56.783
- Are you ready?
- Look, I'm wearing a suit.

1:39:56.867 --> 1:40:00.328
Can't wait to bring a witch
to the samurai summit.

1:40:00.412 --> 1:40:01.997
Okay, prophecy girl.

1:40:04.374 --> 1:40:05.584
Mmm.

1:40:12.924 --> 1:40:14.134
I'll see you guys in there.

1:40:17.512 --> 1:40:18.722
Go get 'em, tiger.

1:40:53.215 --> 1:40:54.382
Lord okoro.

1:40:56.509 --> 1:40:57.886
Lord maeda.

1:40:59.012 --> 1:41:02.182
The battle we fought
has claimed many invaluable lives.

1:41:02.766 --> 1:41:07.312
But we found within our clan
the strength to fight back.

1:41:07.896 --> 1:41:14.402
And that is why today we welcome
the onna-bugeisha into our samurai family.

1:41:14.486 --> 1:41:18.823
Now I'd like to yield the floor
to lord onami.

1:41:23.411 --> 1:41:25.580
Thank you, lord nikko.

1:42:01.866 --> 1:42:04.661
