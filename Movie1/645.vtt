00:51.420 --> 00:52.710
Move, move, quickly!

00:52.710 --> 00:53.790
To the position of the four battalions!

00:53.790 --> 00:56.560
Get the burnt box!\NHurry up!

00:56.560 --> 00:57.760
Team 1 is ready!

00:57.760 --> 00:58.730
How many shots are coming?

00:58.730 --> 01:00.120
I think 20 shots.

01:00.210 --> 01:01.660
Son of bitches..

01:01.900 --> 01:04.900
We'll pay you back with 50 shots\Ncounter fire!

01:04.910 --> 01:08.360
50 menace shots, fire!

01:08.360 --> 01:09.780

How many shots?

01:15.690 --> 01:17.330
Two hundred shots.

01:17.330 --> 01:19.140
These bastards..

01:20.810 --> 01:22.580
Just go over 500 shots.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.090
Chief of staff!

01:24.090 --> 01:25.430
I think it's 100 shots this time!

01:25.430 --> 01:28.150
Are they crazy?\NAre they going to war?

01:29.310 --> 01:30.490
Blow 200 shots!

01:31.750 --> 01:36.060
A few years ago, the front unit, which had been pierced in knock order, was pierced again.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.110
It's broke.\NMilitary discipline is broken.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.100
Is the military an army these days?You have to roll it.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.920
-Bang!\N-Bang!

01:45.920 --> 01:48.120

01:53.640 --> 01:55.930
-Bang!\N- Thank you!

01:57.920 --> 02:00.540
Hey, what's the sound?\NStill in a war?

02:00.590 --> 02:04.160
The North is continuing to shoot and provoke, perhaps because of an accident in Cheorwon.

02:04.310 --> 02:05.680
Hey, I'm on my way.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.430
Don't back down. Push it according to the rules of engagement.

02:09.410 --> 02:13.610
You're wasting your ammo, you punks.

02:14.170 --> 02:17.040
So far, 3,000 shots have been fired.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.370
Give me another 300 shots.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.430
The second round is on me.

02:38.430 --> 02:39.620
The 2nd round is...

03:14.300 --> 03:15.460
It's today's mission.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.460
Captain's on his way, you know?

03:17.460 --> 03:20.700
Captain, there're three horse dungs, three.

03:22.010 --> 03:26.140
Go and see where it's coming from. Go!

03:29.640 --> 03:32.770
Can sergeant Park talk to dogs?

03:32.770 --> 03:34.030
Where are you?

03:35.160 --> 03:36.270
500m?

03:38.450 --> 03:40.610

05:01.100 --> 05:03.120
Sergeant Park, you're amazing.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.420
Isn't he like a milk barista?

05:05.610 --> 05:07.630
My house used to have a big ranch.

05:07.630 --> 05:08.580
- Ranch?\N- Ranch.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.920
Why do you forget about the foot-and-mouth disease?

05:10.920 --> 05:11.850
Loyalty!

05:12.560 --> 05:13.580
- Hey, Seongho!\N- Yes.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.870
Not going to work, huh?

05:16.250 --> 05:18.890
Hey, if knock defect is coming again you know?\NGet moving!

05:18.890 --> 05:19.600
- I got it!\N- Hey, hey.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.620
Let's clean this up. Let's go clean up our area!

05:21.620 --> 05:22.540
- Yes, sir!\N- Got it!

05:22.540 --> 05:23.380
Come on.

05:23.510 --> 05:24.660
- Move quickly, move, move.

05:24.660 --> 05:25.840
- Yes, sir\N- Yes, sir.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.060
Supply officer, are you on duty?

05:29.060 --> 05:32.330
No, it looks like the hols's stuck again.

05:32.770 --> 05:34.390
It's not easy to get water.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.180
- Take care of yourself. Thank you.

05:37.180 --> 05:38.880
- Good day.\N- Good luck!

05:43.070 --> 05:45.900
- Hey, bring me the chessboard.\N- Yes, sir.

05:47.060 --> 05:49.270
- How many days are left?\N- Private Kim Hyunsoo!

05:49.380 --> 05:50.620
97 days.

05:50.620 --> 05:51.960
Oh, 15 hours.

05:51.990 --> 05:53.870
No, 15 hours.\N30 minutes are left!

05:53.870 --> 05:55.000
Still?

05:55.140 --> 05:56.560
Yes, right.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.430
What's wrong with this?

06:05.060 --> 06:07.110
Okay, the draw has begun!

06:08.870 --> 06:11.500
The first lucky number is 39.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.660
What's the second\Nlucky number?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.920
36.

06:20.730 --> 06:22.280
Damn, I got two right.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.000
Here's a draw for the 3rd number.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.070
3!

06:28.520 --> 06:31.790
Yes, 3...\NThe 4th lucky number.

06:37.850 --> 06:39.260
30.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.790
There are a lot of numbers with 3 letters?

06:41.790 --> 06:44.590
The 5th lucky number is 1!

06:52.250 --> 06:55.270
So, what's the last 6th\Nlucky number?

06:55.270 --> 06:56.560
The ball is spinning fast...

06:57.470 --> 06:58.320
- Get rid of it.\N- Yes, sir!

06:58.320 --> 07:00.770
What are you doing, not preparing for the roll call?

07:01.160 --> 07:03.360
These guys just lost their themselves.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.100
Don't you wake up?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.100
Hey, hey ...

07:12.850 --> 07:14.520
33!

07:14.530 --> 07:17.290
Now, we'll draw a bonus ball for second place.

07:20.380 --> 07:21.770
- The 934th.\N- Hey.

07:21.770 --> 07:23.650
- I'll give you the lottery numbers.\N- What's wrong with him?

07:23.650 --> 07:25.980
- //39, //30, //3\N- Probably spoiled milk.

07:25.980 --> 07:27.220
You did.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.650
Spoiled milk?

07:31.880 --> 07:33.380
- What's wrong?\N- Are you crazy?

07:41.630 --> 07:43.250
Drank spoiled milk?

07:43.600 --> 07:44.960
Spoiled milk?

07:46.380 --> 07:47.890
Crying while laughing.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.780
Hey, go.

07:54.820 --> 07:58.170
Excuse me, Sergeant Park. Are you okay?

07:58.560 --> 08:01.830
No, because the world is so beautiful.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.710
Yeah?

08:11.460 --> 08:12.820
Hey, what are you saying?

08:13.030 --> 08:14.250
I don't know.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.700
5.7 billion.

08:35.710 --> 08:40.090
South Korean soldiers.Hello.

08:40.380 --> 08:45.940
How hard is it to work on the front desk all day and night?

08:46.330 --> 08:48.410
We, the guards,

08:48.410 --> 08:53.210
are here with warm love and consideration from the awe-inspiring Commander Comrade.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.090
North Korean soldiers,

08:55.090 --> 09:00.420
there's a weather forecast on the supercomputer of the Korea Meteorological Administration.

09:00.420 --> 09:02.180
It will rain in three hours.

09:02.180 --> 09:08.190
With the affection of our compatriots, we inform North Korea that there is no other supercomputer.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.330
Hey, what are we gonna do about this?

09:11.330 --> 09:15.850
According to our North Korean scientific satellite\NGwangmyeongseong No. 2.

09:15.850 --> 09:18.240
It's not raining.

09:18.240 --> 09:23.320
Our comrade fart man(Bang Kwi Nam) soldier leader and I

09:23.810 --> 09:26.250
have developed a lot of feelings in such a program,

09:26.250 --> 09:29.400
he has no taste and dryness, his name is also very rustic,

09:29.410 --> 09:33.230
we have prepared three lines of poetry for comrade fart man, you wanna hear it?

09:33.240 --> 09:37.260
IU from North Korea prepared an acrostic poem.

09:37.730 --> 09:39.470
Of course I'll have to hear it.

09:39.470 --> 09:43.390
Fart, farting boom boom.

09:43.390 --> 09:46.120
Kwi, Kwi-nam.

09:46.120 --> 09:50.650
Nam, South Korean hot pants.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.150
Hot pants..

09:55.010 --> 09:57.630
Comrade Yeonhee, take it easy.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.860
Since IU sent us an acrostic poem.

10:02.860 --> 10:05.770
I should send you a reply with an acrostic poem.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.170
I know.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.140
IU is the most beautiful singer in South Korea.

10:11.420 --> 10:14.110
Should I say the first letter?\NAh.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.120
She still think

10:17.450 --> 10:21.200
she's pretty.

10:21.270 --> 10:24.720
Yoo, I'm sorry to hear that.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.600
Sergeant Park!

10:28.600 --> 10:32.300
A South Korean soldier who only judges people by their looks.

10:32.330 --> 10:33.600
Don't you have a girlfriend?

10:34.110 --> 10:35.970
You're very angry.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.600
But even angrier if you heard this?

10:39.490 --> 10:42.850
That's what, 10 years of military service?

10:43.060 --> 10:47.750
What should I do?\NI'm about to be discharged.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.520
Where's medicine.

10:53.290 --> 10:55.720
unable to get rid of the nasty sickness.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.240
If you play around like that,

10:58.430 --> 11:01.700
you're likely to end up in an acorn.

11:01.700 --> 11:05.180
Irrational madness.\NThat's it. Come on!

11:05.180 --> 11:07.010
Come on!

11:08.510 --> 11:13.370
- It's not a coincidence.\N- Loyalty!

11:14.640 --> 11:17.210
What's

11:17.280 --> 11:17.940
that?

11:17.940 --> 11:21.000
I think our GP has soldiers of interest.

11:22.210 --> 11:23.250
Soldiers of interest?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.890
Sergeant Park Chun-woo is a bit weird these days.

11:29.260 --> 11:30.450
Park Chun-woo?

11:30.870 --> 11:33.590
A real rich man doesn't ignore others.

11:33.590 --> 11:35.840
A positive attitude of keeping dignity.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.810
That's the real elite.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.300
It's a good story.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.440
Well, can I go to the bathroom?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.890
Why are you asking me that?\NAsk your old man.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.860
It's not small, it's big.

11:53.470 --> 11:57.070
You're doing a good job.\NYou're not supposed to hold back your shit.

12:21.550 --> 12:22.590
No!

12:23.800 --> 12:24.850
What am I supposed to do?

13:58.230 --> 13:59.970
Welcome, Comrade Lee Yongho.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.680
What are you looking at?

14:05.180 --> 14:08.220
I am just bored watching the German War movie.

14:10.570 --> 14:12.110
Watch it together?

14:23.360 --> 14:26.010
I've memorized everything now.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.090
I should've seen this more than 100 times.

14:29.900 --> 14:30.950
Chol-jin companion.

14:31.110 --> 14:33.000
Can I ask you something?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.320
I don't know anyone else, but I have to help Lee Yong-ho.

14:38.180 --> 14:41.010
I picked up a piece of South Korean paper.

14:41.870 --> 14:43.330
You know what this is?

14:44.310 --> 14:45.770
It's called 645.

14:45.770 --> 14:46.880
645?

14:47.070 --> 14:50.820
If you get 6 correct out of 45 numbers,

14:50.820 --> 14:54.640
A vicious capitalist exploitation technique

14:54.900 --> 14:57.200
that fleeces the Korean people in the name of giving them huge amounts of money.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.300
But this is the day of the last drawing.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.920
Is this the latest piece of paper?

15:04.420 --> 15:05.980
Just for fun, take a look.

15:06.270 --> 15:07.190
OK.

15:12.150 --> 15:14.140
Okay, there it is. .

15:14.380 --> 15:17.690
Number one, three, and thirty.

15:17.910 --> 15:18.930
3...

15:20.070 --> 15:23.950
33, 36.

15:24.410 --> 15:26.850
Lastly, number 39.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.470
This is the number one.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.780
What's the matter, Comrade Chol Jin?

15:36.780 --> 15:37.730
It's...

15:38.980 --> 15:40.160
What is this?

15:40.660 --> 15:43.030
Yeah, well...

15:45.940 --> 15:47.780
What should we do?

15:48.160 --> 15:49.100
Yeah?

16:00.480 --> 16:01.890
I almost broke my back.

16:03.940 --> 16:06.570
The temperature is 21 degrees Celsius and the wind is from the northeast.

16:06.570 --> 16:10.030
The wind speed is 14 m /s\NA lottery ticket weighs 75 grams.

16:10.190 --> 16:11.750
If you plug in the formula for free fall.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.660
The flight distance of Lotto is 1.23 km.

16:25.230 --> 16:28.170
This is where the lottery is.

16:31.330 --> 16:32.620
What's going on?

16:36.340 --> 16:37.370
What?

16:58.470 --> 17:00.080
Just hand out the flyers!

17:04.130 --> 17:05.079
Oh.

17:13.430 --> 17:16.440
Hello, here.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.849
Put the gun down.

17:26.490 --> 17:28.420
I'm not gonna eat you. Okay?

17:41.800 --> 17:42.980
Come on.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.200
Put the gun down.

18:06.090 --> 18:07.340
What's your name?

18:07.710 --> 18:08.970
It's Park Chunwoo?

18:09.190 --> 18:10.620
My name is Lee Yongho.

18:11.310 --> 18:12.790
Sergeant Lee Yongho.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.250
Sergeant Lee Yongho.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.110
It's been three days since we met.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.770
I came out to meet my South Korean soldier.

18:23.630 --> 18:26.990
Welcome to Free Korea.

18:27.070 --> 18:31.110
What are you talking about, you stupid?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.840
But why do you keep talking informally?

18:33.910 --> 18:34.940
I mean you.

18:36.350 --> 18:38.430
Do you know the game called "645"?

18:39.390 --> 18:42.600
Out of 45 numbers, if you get 6 correct, you'll get 1st place.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.390
I picked up a 645.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.800
This is a piece of paper for first place.

18:49.010 --> 18:50.190
So..

18:50.950 --> 18:54.010
I'll give you 10% if you bring the cash.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.650
I finally found it, thank you!

19:01.440 --> 19:02.860
Hey, North Korean soldier.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.390
That, that's mine.

19:05.390 --> 19:09.070
So give it to me while I'm being nice.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.050
What?

19:11.230 --> 19:12.310
Is this yours?

19:12.310 --> 19:15.340
Yeah, that's how I got here.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.690
Stupid.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.510
934th, right?

19:20.510 --> 19:22.750
- Yeah.\N-1, 3, 30.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.410
Number 33, number 36, number 39, right?

19:25.410 --> 19:27.790
Yeah, so it's mine! Give it back!

19:29.550 --> 19:31.820
You Korean boy think I'm hot pants?

19:32.320 --> 19:35.480
And where does this note belong?

19:36.160 --> 19:37.400
Who got it who's the owner.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.650
What does that mean?\NWhat's that?

19:45.020 --> 19:46.220
Sergeant Park Chun-woo.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.160
When is your next shift again?

19:49.160 --> 19:51.460
- What's that?\N- Answer me, you jerk!

19:51.550 --> 19:53.210
Three days later, you punk!

19:53.210 --> 19:54.820
I'll see you here in three days.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.210
I'm gonna talk to you here again, okay?

20:00.700 --> 20:01.700
Wait.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.230
It hurts a lot?

20:05.350 --> 20:06.200
No.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.050
Are you... At night..

20:08.050 --> 20:10.420
Did you meet a ghost and wrestled?

20:10.480 --> 20:11.010
No.

20:11.010 --> 20:14.080
But why do you walk around at night like a madman?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.100
And in a minefield you'll find if you go in.

20:16.110 --> 20:17.720
Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't explode?

20:17.720 --> 20:21.150
You cross the bars and you're in the brig by law.

20:21.150 --> 20:22.690
But you'll be discharged in a few months

20:23.150 --> 20:26.360
and you have serious mental health problems.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.570
I'm alright.

20:29.630 --> 20:30.650
No problem at all.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.860
But why cross the barbed wire every night like a madman.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.660
Wandering around the Demilitarized Zone, you punk!

20:34.660 --> 20:37.400
Five of the dog holes you dug!\NWho are you?

20:37.550 --> 20:38.710
Really son of bitch?

20:38.710 --> 20:39.920
Are you a spy? Nasty bastard.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.870
I'm not a spy.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.550
Don't you dare talk back to me, boy!

20:55.590 --> 20:59.590
I'll report to the main office first\NGo to the hospital for treatment first.

21:03.710 --> 21:09.660
Actually, I won first prize in the lottery.

21:09.690 --> 21:11.400
I was watching TV in the Home Office.

21:11.400 --> 21:17.200
Number 1, 3, 30, 33\NNumber 36 and 39.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.690
The prize money alone is 5.7 billion won.

21:19.690 --> 21:23.630
That lottery was brought to me by the battalion leader in the Jeep.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.520
He didn't give it to me. It came like fate.

21:26.680 --> 21:30.800
The recruits on duty together suddenly had diarrhea, and the ticket flew away.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.750
- Is that gone?\N-yeah!

21:32.750 --> 21:34.190
- So?\N- Well, so...

21:34.190 --> 21:36.310
So, go back a little, huh?

21:36.310 --> 21:38.060
Let me talk freely, huh?

21:39.730 --> 21:42.440
- The lottery flew to the north.\N- Yes, yes

21:42.540 --> 21:45.480
A North Korean soldier named Sergeant Lee Yongho picked it up.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.450
I'm Captain Kang, 437\NPut me through to the hospital.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.160
No, no, Chief.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.880
- A few days ago, at the Military Demarcation Line.\N- Yes.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.620
I met the North Korean soldier.

21:54.670 --> 21:57.000
But the guy only wants to give me 10%.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.050
That's a shame! That's mine.

21:59.130 --> 22:02.130
It's yours, so it's not making sense.\NRight?

22:02.980 --> 22:06.670
Do you have a helicopter now?\NWe have a critical patient. We need to get him out of here.

22:06.680 --> 22:11.040
No, we were supposed to meet the North Korean soldier in three days...

22:11.040 --> 22:14.080
Now the hole's blocked up. I can't see him.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.560
The dog holes are blocked up.

22:16.650 --> 22:18.040
It must have been hard?

22:19.200 --> 22:22.040
Can you at least send a truck if the ambulance can't stop?

22:23.780 --> 22:25.210
Look at my eyes.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.790
Yeah?

22:28.590 --> 22:30.360
We're going to the hospital. Hurry up.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.070
No.

22:31.070 --> 22:32.680
- I know I can't do that.\N- What?

22:32.820 --> 22:33.760
Look.

22:35.430 --> 22:38.410
I told you it's true.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.780
I won 5.7 billion in the lottery!

22:47.130 --> 22:49.730
Loyalty! TOD observation soldier\NPrivate First Class Kim Man-Cheol!

22:49.760 --> 22:51.460
I need to talk to my leader.

22:52.070 --> 22:54.800
You're just in time.\NYou use your computer a lot, don't you?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.860
Can you use TOD to detect fake photos?

22:58.230 --> 23:01.560
Computers have nothing to do with TOD.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.590
This guy's good. He faked a photo, huh?

23:04.760 --> 23:08.260
Let's go back. There's another one.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.520
5.7 billion in North Korea?

23:25.710 --> 23:26.770
Sergeant Park.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.300
So you risked your life over the fence?

23:29.680 --> 23:31.180
You're really incredible.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.670
Hey, I'm glad I found it.\NIt's heaven's help

23:37.620 --> 23:40.760
This secret is carried to the end of the grave.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.480
- Yes.\N- Yes.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.630
In all battles, power analysis is the basic.

23:44.170 --> 23:46.570
If you know your enemy and know us, you'll win every battle.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.730
What kind of guy is that North Korean guy who picked up the lottery?

23:50.950 --> 23:52.250
A bastard.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.060
Bastard?

23:54.320 --> 23:55.600
Yes.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.410
For the sake of the party and the people.

23:58.950 --> 24:01.610
I thought this money should be spent for the country, of course.

24:01.610 --> 24:03.960
Same.

24:04.700 --> 24:08.720
What have the party and the state done for us?

24:11.160 --> 24:12.500
You're right.

24:12.580 --> 24:15.480
I wholeheartedly agree with Comrade Lee Yong-ho.

24:16.660 --> 24:18.350
Hard parents,

24:19.150 --> 24:21.530
my sister wants to be a singer's dream,

24:22.530 --> 24:24.290
I will achieve in the end.

24:24.290 --> 24:28.820
I have to change my dad's dentures first.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.070
Very steel alloy\NSwiss dentures.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.950
Change them all.

24:35.630 --> 24:37.240
Chol Jin superior soldier comrade.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.350
This heart must not change.

24:42.930 --> 24:46.790
Whatever it takes to kick that Korean son of a bitch's ass.

24:46.790 --> 24:49.630
Make sure you get back from your mission.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.490
You know I have a daughter, right?

24:54.660 --> 24:57.330
Doesn't have a piano that everyone else have.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.270
I came home one day.

25:00.070 --> 25:03.440
She drew the piano on the drawing paper with colored pencils.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.800
Sola Sola Redo.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.870
Can I give you 10%?

25:13.640 --> 25:16.390
One day my wife is going to

25:16.620 --> 25:19.350
pay my mother's medical bills

25:19.780 --> 25:22.080
I'm going to put mom in a nursing home,

25:22.320 --> 25:25.090
but I don't have the money or the piano.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.100
One day the kid said,

25:27.990 --> 25:31.750
Dad, why don't we have money?

25:33.420 --> 25:35.230
Can I give you 15%?

25:37.870 --> 25:41.680
With generous support and sponsorship for 15% of the shares, there is no better platoon leader.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.710
Sergeant Park Chun-woo.

25:45.030 --> 25:47.830
I'm a man of conscience, huh?\NLet's do it well.

25:56.770 --> 25:58.220
Manchul, what number do you like?

25:58.650 --> 26:00.260
Number? Maybe, 7?

26:00.380 --> 26:02.200
- Ok, give you 7%\N- 10.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.450
So the number 10, 10.

26:09.940 --> 26:14.190
Come to think of it, isn't that a nice, perfect number?

26:14.200 --> 26:18.350
Ten. Name is Ten. Ten. Ten

26:18.630 --> 26:19.710
10, Ten.

26:20.090 --> 26:21.350
Sergeant Park! Park...

26:22.010 --> 26:24.590
What? Why is this open?

26:24.840 --> 26:26.350
I think this is a supply tube.

26:26.550 --> 26:29.340
The pipes are so old that they are often unclogged.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.490
There is no ice in the demilitarized zone even in winter.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.340
Only the supply officer knows the map of the springs and Wells.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.700
How nice would it be to open up and talk?

26:39.790 --> 26:42.760
On the south side is the Lost Property Act.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.650
I mean, there's all kinds of weird stuff going on.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.660
See, section four of the Lost Property Act.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.140
When picking up something lost by another.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.960
Compensation ranges from 5 percent to 20 percent.

26:54.210 --> 26:55.410
How great would that be?

26:55.410 --> 26:58.090
According to the law, you can claim compensation.

26:58.380 --> 26:59.220
Is that so?

26:59.220 --> 27:02.180
So I'm 80, you're 20.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.540
Get out.

27:07.140 --> 27:09.820
You really don't understand the language.

27:09.820 --> 27:12.440
You'll need an ID to get that.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.820
And even if you hold it, you wouldn't get any prize money!

27:15.930 --> 27:18.100
It is said that the period to collect the bonus is one year.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.430
You think there's nothing we can do?

27:20.430 --> 27:23.870
Search all defectors whose in-laws and relatives have settled in the south.

27:24.030 --> 27:25.750
We can find it, too. We win.

27:25.750 --> 27:29.250
You don't make any sense. Negotiations are broken.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.280
You bas...\NReally...

27:38.020 --> 27:39.160
How did it go?

27:39.440 --> 27:42.100
Where are those Korean motherfuckers?

27:43.150 --> 27:44.470
If we search the defectors carefully.

27:44.470 --> 27:46.700
We can find it, too.\NCan't we threaten him?

27:51.970 --> 27:54.310
If you read that right.

27:54.650 --> 27:58.370
I wouldn't have anything to say right now if you were sentenced on the spot.

27:58.370 --> 27:59.660
Comrade political instructor.

27:59.790 --> 28:00.900
Put the gun down.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.390
Where do you want to go?

28:05.410 --> 28:09.410
Yoduk political prison camp? Gaechon camp?\NPick one.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.010
That's where people used to sweat and bleed.

28:13.020 --> 28:15.540
The exploiters and the sectarians have come together.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.460
It's like coming back to home. Very warm.

28:17.460 --> 28:21.200
I'll tell you the truth, political instructor.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.290
Not long ago Comrade Li Yongho.

28:23.290 --> 28:26.600
Picked up a lottery ticket blown by the wind from Korea.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.640
What's that?

28:27.640 --> 28:29.840
I hear they give you a lot of money if you win.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.570
- The Korean people's...\N- son of...

28:32.000 --> 28:35.130
Political instructor comrade, the 645 won the first prize.

28:35.690 --> 28:38.520
The Korean kid who claimed 645 was his.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.930
We're negotiating a 50-50 split.

28:44.220 --> 28:45.610
How much is the bonus?

28:45.620 --> 28:48.090
The total amount is 5.7 billion won.

28:48.090 --> 28:50.100
How much dollar.

28:50.450 --> 28:51.740
In dollar terms...

28:54.100 --> 28:55.740
6 million.

28:59.730 --> 29:02.650
What? 6 million?

29:02.770 --> 29:05.190
How much money are they gonna give us?

29:05.230 --> 29:07.170
It must be 900,000.

29:07.530 --> 29:09.300
Told us to eat 100,000.

29:09.370 --> 29:11.680
No,10...\NI'm really speechless.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.730
Aren't they thieves?

29:13.870 --> 29:15.680
You think the north-south issue is that simple?

29:17.780 --> 29:19.350
They always use brinkmanship.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.980
The negotiations have broken down.\NWhat should we do now?

29:23.060 --> 29:25.570
Negotiations are meant to be made up before fight.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.120
We're gonna have to reconnect.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.030
Does that give us an answer?

29:49.030 --> 29:53.060
Meeting is a precious thing.

29:53.330 --> 29:57.500
How earnestly are we waiting to meet?

29:57.500 --> 30:02.060
The depression of not having an answer is really overwhelming.

30:02.350 --> 30:06.430
I would like to speak to my compatriots in the North who do not sleep at night.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.220
Kiha & The Faces.

30:10.570 --> 30:13.870
Let's meet now.

30:17.230 --> 30:20.690
Uh, warden, there, there..

30:21.350 --> 30:24.760
I've seen it too, punks.

30:29.910 --> 30:32.030
There must be a new number of people.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.690
People?

30:35.160 --> 30:36.680
What's wrong with them?

30:38.160 --> 30:40.290
It looks like Korean consonants.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.230
Korean initial consonants?

30:42.350 --> 30:43.300
Yes.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.540
Korean initial consonants? That's "k" in Korean. "K" in Korean.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.770
Oh, right, right, right.

30:49.770 --> 30:52.370
That, that k, d.

30:52.370 --> 30:53.150
Yes!

30:53.150 --> 30:55.010
- Hey, man, Manchul, you write it down.\N- Yes.

30:56.270 --> 30:58.460
"K" and "S".

30:58.510 --> 30:59.580
I, I.

30:59.580 --> 31:01.250
- Is it Chi?\N- Right, right, right

31:01.610 --> 31:05.290
Why do you keep rubbing your butt?

31:05.660 --> 31:09.340
If it's "k" and "d", then "military"?

31:09.510 --> 31:11.010
Chief, you're right.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.400
Army, yes, you and I are the same army, army!

31:14.700 --> 31:17.390
What about "K" and "S"?

31:19.160 --> 31:20.210
Military?

31:20.690 --> 31:21.600
Military.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.090
Army, military.\NWe're getting in, all right?

31:25.090 --> 31:26.110
After then?

31:26.480 --> 31:27.450
Together?

31:28.250 --> 31:29.090
Yeah?

31:30.880 --> 31:31.840
Courtship?

31:33.300 --> 31:35.170
A, Prison?

31:35.690 --> 31:37.620
Like a dog bird?

31:37.620 --> 31:41.300
A joint chest gay?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.260
High-dap chest muscles?

31:43.760 --> 31:45.950
You really have a poor imagination...

31:45.980 --> 31:49.100
Co-parasitic fruit..

31:49.100 --> 31:52.310
Hey, is that imagination?\NLonely death zone.

31:54.820 --> 31:56.460
- Together?\N- Wait a minute

31:57.080 --> 31:57.970
Why? What's wrong?

31:57.970 --> 32:02.480
Who's in our GP that can go in and out of the Demilitarized Zone at will?

32:02.480 --> 32:06.360
What, the water supply officer with the key to the gate?

32:06.400 --> 32:08.930
Then they have a supply tube, right?

32:09.620 --> 32:10.410
That's it.

32:10.410 --> 32:13.510
Don't they have to bring water from somewhere in the winter?

32:13.520 --> 32:15.230
- That's right.\N- That's right.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.250
Here's the place they were talking about.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.660
Common.

32:27.660 --> 32:28.630
Water supply.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.290
District.

32:29.290 --> 32:32.770
JSA Common Water supply area.

32:39.310 --> 32:42.120
Hey, give me the medicine that the supply officer drew.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.450
Ah? You want me to look through it?

32:44.700 --> 32:47.090
Look with your heart and you'll find it.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.120
Heart?

32:49.930 --> 32:51.350
I'm really going crazy.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.810
Hey, where are you going?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.110
A single stroke between controls.

33:42.570 --> 33:45.760
You're not a chicken head, are you?

33:52.620 --> 33:53.810
Drop the gun.

33:55.960 --> 33:56.960
Drop the gun.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.140
So before we get to the talks,

34:06.140 --> 34:09.060
According to the principles of the UN Command,

34:09.380 --> 34:11.810
Weapons will be collected separately.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.219
Good.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.620
It's like our military academy.

34:26.620 --> 34:30.580
The lost and Found Act is bullshit.

34:30.580 --> 34:34.730
I'm here to sternly correct a thief who went mad after eating it.

34:34.730 --> 34:36.969
It's not 645, it's the lottery.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.090
You have to be clear about that..

34:39.090 --> 34:40.760
Don't use USA language.

34:41.010 --> 34:43.310
This is not Korean land.

34:43.310 --> 34:44.889
Let me ask you a question.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.630
Do you know what the taxes are on the lottery?

34:48.150 --> 34:49.179
Tax?

34:50.190 --> 34:52.790
I knew this would happen.\NFor a skilled TA.

34:53.090 --> 34:53.929
In the future.

34:58.190 --> 35:02.550
The total winnings amount to N5.765772,844 won.

35:03.190 --> 35:06.540
Up to 300 million won, 20 percent of other income tax and 2 percent of N resident tax will total 22 percent.

35:06.540 --> 35:10.420
Over 300 million won, other income tax is 30 percent\Nand resident tax is 3 percent, or 33 percent.

35:10.550 --> 35:13.110
The actual amount received, excluding income tax and residential tax, is

35:14.430 --> 35:18.400
3,914,959,762 won.

35:20.170 --> 35:21.190
You don't even know that.

35:21.190 --> 35:23.980
What about 80% and what about 90%?

35:23.980 --> 35:26.800
Show us, comrade Choljin.

35:30.070 --> 35:33.200
What is it? Lunch boxed meal?

35:36.670 --> 35:39.930
It's just a strong point that's easy to recognize.

35:39.930 --> 35:40.880
Strong point?

35:40.880 --> 35:43.900
Yanks call them PowerPoint?

35:43.900 --> 35:46.200
Our People's Army is beyond words.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.370
I just need one shot of drawing.

35:47.370 --> 35:50.040
Why bother to talk like that and look good?

35:50.050 --> 35:51.800
We didn't budge an inch in our opinion,

35:52.130 --> 35:54.860
so you know what?

35:54.860 --> 35:56.870
What if we don't take it?

35:58.140 --> 36:02.040
Then I have nothing to say.

36:03.820 --> 36:04.910
Get up, everybody.

36:05.470 --> 36:07.610
Here we go again!

36:08.620 --> 36:10.090
Brinkmanship again.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.820
In that case, do you think we'd be scared?

36:11.820 --> 36:13.460
And why do you own the lottery?

36:13.460 --> 36:16.450
You won't get the prize with it anyway.

36:16.450 --> 36:18.980
Do you know where to find the prize money?

36:22.850 --> 36:24.940
Is it not looking at the co-op?

36:24.950 --> 36:26.340
Agricultural cooperatives.

36:26.530 --> 36:29.460
Uncle, we're not a co-op.

36:29.660 --> 36:32.810
The Agricultural Cooperative is at the bank. The bank.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.080
Eight to two? That's a lot of concessions.

36:37.090 --> 36:40.500
Did you learn to eat for free from American wolves?

36:40.500 --> 36:42.580
Do you run the lottery?

36:43.030 --> 36:45.510
This is property issued by the Republic of Korea.

36:45.700 --> 36:49.430
You are illegally occupying our property, do you understand that?

36:49.640 --> 36:53.690
What do you suggest?\NIllegal possession?

36:55.780 --> 37:00.230
You're lucky you didn't go to the Azzo coal mine.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.670
Azzo coal mine?

37:02.000 --> 37:04.510
You punk!\NAre you done talking?

37:04.510 --> 37:06.370
Yeah, I'm done. Why?\NWhat are you gonna do?

37:06.370 --> 37:07.930
Scoundrels.

37:07.930 --> 37:09.970
I was going to make it good, but it didn't work!

37:09.970 --> 37:12.610
What if I don't do well?\NAre you trying to do it or what?

37:12.610 --> 37:13.920
You punks!

37:15.290 --> 37:17.220
We don't need any money!

37:17.300 --> 37:20.590
I'm gonna burn that guy's 645.\NI'm gonna burn him up!

37:20.590 --> 37:22.010
- I'm gonna burn it\N- Burn it!

37:32.450 --> 37:35.940
Those guys could really burn up.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.500
I feel depressed too.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.650
I've never seen such an ignorant person.

37:41.230 --> 37:43.930
Let's just, let's just do what they say.

37:44.460 --> 37:46.810
Hey, how can you say that?

37:47.320 --> 37:49.690
That's ours. Why is it 10% of ours?

37:49.900 --> 37:52.160
All I have to do is get the lottery back.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.400
Think about it.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.110
We have the ticket. What are they gonna do?

38:00.480 --> 38:02.530
Yeah, that's the right answer.

38:05.440 --> 38:09.720
Mr. Political instructor, are you really gonna burn 645?

38:11.580 --> 38:14.460
So we don't need the money either?

38:14.460 --> 38:15.790
So what do we do?

38:15.790 --> 38:18.860
Are you asking me to bow down to those useless guys?

38:18.910 --> 38:21.700
I should have taken 10%.

38:22.210 --> 38:25.320
Isn't that a lot of money for us?

38:28.910 --> 38:31.160
8 : 2!\NWe won't budge any more!

38:31.160 --> 38:33.910
Fxxk 8:2.\N7:3.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.260
Who take the 7.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.290
Of course you.

38:42.410 --> 38:44.760
Did you say we're 7?

38:45.380 --> 38:47.920
Considering North Korea's difficult economic situation.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.770
We made a decision for the greater good.

38:49.770 --> 38:52.830
Is it true?\NIs that a fake account?

38:52.830 --> 38:53.580
So.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.330
Can we at least write up an agreement?

38:55.590 --> 38:57.900
Of course we do.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.050
The 645 agreement.

38:59.190 --> 39:00.170
Clause 1.

39:00.260 --> 39:04.950
The winning sum is Democratic People's Republic of Korea take 7\NIn proportion to the Republic of Korea take 3.

39:04.950 --> 39:09.470
Clause 2, even in the event of a natural disaster.

39:09.470 --> 39:12.620
Clause 3, if there is a dispute between the two Koreas.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.670
The International Court of Justice of the United Nations\Nis a court of exclusive jurisdiction.

39:15.670 --> 39:18.700
Clause 4, two copies of the agreement.

39:18.860 --> 39:22.290
The north and the south keep one copy after signing and sealing.

39:34.140 --> 39:37.490
Remember, it's either 7-3 or war.

39:40.110 --> 39:42.770
Just trust me for once for the sake of national prosperity.

39:46.410 --> 39:47.460
Wait.

39:48.930 --> 39:50.430
Just saying.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.740
What happens if you do not pay

39:53.740 --> 39:56.510
after we give 645?

39:58.850 --> 40:00.330
Those sons of bitches.

40:00.370 --> 40:02.740
Is that why we're making a 7-3 offer?

40:03.760 --> 40:05.840
That's what he was thinking.

40:06.830 --> 40:07.670
Put down.

40:08.810 --> 40:11.400
You got to let it go, stupid.

40:11.640 --> 40:12.830
I told you to let it go.

40:12.950 --> 40:14.540
I told you.

40:14.590 --> 40:16.640
If you don't let go on the count of three.

40:16.870 --> 40:19.160
I'm gonna rip your teeth out.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.030
OK.

40:23.350 --> 40:24.830
Do it.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.520
1!

40:27.430 --> 40:28.640
2!

40:36.900 --> 40:39.090
- 3!\N- 3!

40:50.850 --> 40:52.910
- Hurry up and find the lottery! Come on!\N- Take 645 away! 645!

40:52.910 --> 40:55.080
You sons of bitches!\NI'm gonna shoot you!

40:55.080 --> 40:57.430
- Shoot me! Bastard! Shoot!!!!\N-Manchul, where are you?

40:57.910 --> 40:58.990
Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!

40:59.480 --> 41:01.520
It's because I know where it is when it'sound.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.890
- Move...\N- You out of your mind?

41:03.800 --> 41:07.410
- Chief, where are you?\N- Don't look for me, man!

41:07.410 --> 41:09.860
- Wait, wait, wait...\N- Come here.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.510
Eyes, eyes, eyes...

41:15.500 --> 41:16.550
- Stupid.\N- Stupid.

41:16.550 --> 41:18.460
- Bring it on .\N- What are you doing here?

41:19.180 --> 41:22.770
Just turn on the light, but it's dark. Did you see anything?

41:24.320 --> 41:26.650
These unnatural and helpless feelings.

41:27.000 --> 41:27.820
Good.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.420
Here, take a picture.

41:31.340 --> 41:32.260
Good.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.170
A little bit over here.

41:35.470 --> 41:36.340
Good.

41:36.340 --> 41:38.390
Isn't that the South Korean supply officer?

41:38.810 --> 41:41.440
Ah, ah!\NWhat are you doing here?

41:41.440 --> 41:43.940
Didn't we have a blockage in the water line before?

41:44.440 --> 41:46.260
I helped a lot back then.

41:48.710 --> 41:49.960
What's this?

41:52.460 --> 41:54.690
I've heard about what's going on.

41:55.090 --> 41:57.110
Sergeant Park, how much did you pay for it?

41:57.640 --> 41:58.660
I didn't.

41:59.300 --> 42:00.130
Didn't?

42:00.130 --> 42:01.230
Just picked it.

42:01.770 --> 42:03.920
- Hey, this...\N- Hey, be quiet!

42:03.920 --> 42:05.620
What? Pick up?

42:05.620 --> 42:08.110
Even your kids pick it up and you are claiming it?

42:08.240 --> 42:09.650
You son of a bitch!

42:09.650 --> 42:11.750
Well, I think...

42:12.050 --> 42:14.920
Because it's something that no one can claim.

42:14.970 --> 42:16.000
It's the Peace lottery.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.720
How about a 50-50 split?

42:21.860 --> 42:24.750
Five to five, we're good.

42:24.900 --> 42:26.750
A clean 50-50 split, huh?

42:27.010 --> 42:28.050
Good!

42:28.050 --> 42:30.110
All right, I got it.

42:30.110 --> 42:31.520
But it's not over yet.

42:31.830 --> 42:34.180
The north gives the South a lottery.

42:34.180 --> 42:36.660
I think the South will get the first prize back.

42:36.660 --> 42:39.960
But we have to transfer the money north again.

42:40.100 --> 42:41.560
But how are we supposed to trust each other?

42:42.700 --> 42:43.810
How about this?

42:44.570 --> 42:47.900
It's like a prisoner swap in a spy movie.

42:48.690 --> 42:49.860
The duration is 1 week.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.440
The North pays the lottery and the south gets its money back

42:53.440 --> 42:55.710
Before handing over the change to the North again.

42:55.750 --> 42:59.380
One soldier from the north and one from the south.

42:59.720 --> 43:00.880
That should do.

43:00.880 --> 43:02.640
Who's gonna go?

43:14.260 --> 43:17.000
All right, whoever goes!

43:17.160 --> 43:21.130
In case of emergency.

43:21.370 --> 43:23.230
How do you get in touch?

43:25.330 --> 43:26.410
My waist...

43:27.720 --> 43:29.290
You're alive.

43:29.380 --> 43:34.340
This is an ancient emergency network issued in this common water area since the Korean War.

43:34.470 --> 43:38.840
The cell phone of TA-312 A.K.A. Daughter.

43:38.910 --> 43:41.670
But both North and South Korea.

43:42.160 --> 43:46.240
There should be a phone somewhere in GP.

43:47.380 --> 43:48.610
Manchul, where are you from?

43:48.610 --> 43:50.770
Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

43:50.950 --> 43:52.400
I am also of the old school in Seoul.

43:53.230 --> 43:55.720
Sergeant Park, you're from Gangwon-do?

43:55.820 --> 43:58.120
Gangwon-do is not the same Gangwon-do.

43:58.180 --> 44:00.090
It's completely different from North Korea.

44:00.090 --> 44:02.090
Why don't I take the post?

44:02.180 --> 44:04.050
Manchul is not part of our unit.

44:04.050 --> 44:05.630
He was assigned to the TOD observation corps.

44:05.630 --> 44:06.780
Yeah right.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.950
Just 1 week.

44:08.950 --> 44:13.750
But that's not supposed to work, is it?\NHow do I get to North Korea?

44:13.750 --> 44:15.640
Let's play rock paper scissors.

44:15.640 --> 44:16.790
Manly, just one round!

44:16.790 --> 44:18.240
No, Sergeant Park.\NWhat kind of rock-paper-scissors...

44:18.240 --> 44:20.410
Hurry up and play rock paper scissors.\NRock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors.

44:20.410 --> 44:21.840
- Just one round.\N- Just one round

44:21.840 --> 44:23.050
Yeah just one round.

44:23.710 --> 44:25.060
- Hurry up!\N- Yes.

44:25.640 --> 44:26.920
Rock paper scissors.

44:30.620 --> 44:32.690
Wait a minute. Just once.\NWhat? The third round!

44:32.690 --> 44:33.770
Sergeant Park, what's wrong with you?

44:33.770 --> 44:35.140
- Manchul, I'm sorry.\N- It's the last time.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.550
- Where is that? Really?\N- Just one round, just one round.

44:36.550 --> 44:39.760
If I lose this time, I'll really go.\NJust one more round, huh?

44:40.140 --> 44:41.830
It's really the last round!

44:41.830 --> 44:44.660
Yes, just one round!\NI'm really going to go.

44:45.420 --> 44:47.310
Hey, I'm sorry. N-Last, last.

44:47.310 --> 44:48.660
You do it. Rock, paper, scissors.

44:48.670 --> 44:53.170
Yes.\NRock-paper-scissors paper!

45:00.600 --> 45:02.670
Sergeant Park, this is fate.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.270
Punks.

45:16.270 --> 45:19.000
Hey, I didn't do it right!

45:19.010 --> 45:23.390
I'm watching what you guys usually do.

45:23.630 --> 45:27.020
Let the sweat run like a river.

45:27.020 --> 45:30.610
If you roll your eyes like that, does your body flutter?

45:30.770 --> 45:34.190
- Be loyal! Be loyal!\N- Impossible.

45:34.510 --> 45:37.410
There was no place to hide from the sight of our fellow security instructors.

45:37.410 --> 45:38.470
Hey, you!

45:38.470 --> 45:40.240
Rack your brains.

45:41.170 --> 45:44.760
It's about to be executed. We should do something about it.

45:45.230 --> 45:47.510
Even though we sleep under the same quilt in the same housekeeping class.

45:47.510 --> 45:50.340
I wonder who is guarding the comrade instructor's lackey.

45:51.320 --> 45:54.740
Where we can deceive fellow security instructors in our posts.

45:54.780 --> 45:56.390
Not a single place.

46:01.020 --> 46:02.310
There is a place.

46:03.740 --> 46:07.110
The only place we can escape the murderous gaze of our instructor.

46:09.060 --> 46:12.060
Do you know what the most recognized ant is?

46:12.060 --> 46:13.610
Labor ants.

46:14.320 --> 46:19.020
A calf has only one life, and producing milk is also a battle.

46:19.460 --> 46:23.420
Milk 100 kilos a day.

46:23.790 --> 46:27.830
Be the best working cow in the Republic, you know?

46:28.700 --> 46:31.770
Comrade Yeon-hee,\NWhen did you come?

46:31.770 --> 46:35.100
Comrade Youngchul! Why are there wild boars?

46:35.140 --> 46:37.890
Lost Amy near the army not long ago.

46:38.030 --> 46:39.710
I saw him crying, so I picked him up.

46:39.710 --> 46:41.480
Does he have to be fed to eat, too?

46:41.480 --> 46:43.100
In the demilitarized zone.

46:43.100 --> 46:46.090
Don't wild boar and red deer make good egg fillings?

46:46.110 --> 46:48.490
Actually, I'm a little upset.

46:48.500 --> 46:51.480
Could something this beautiful eat me?

46:51.560 --> 46:56.110
Just a month, and you can grow a little more

46:58.560 --> 47:01.200
Brother! Brother!

47:01.260 --> 47:02.470
What?

47:02.940 --> 47:03.880
Here.

47:05.610 --> 47:07.310
What are you doing with your head?

47:12.450 --> 47:14.520
Hey, recruit.\NPut it up there.

47:14.530 --> 47:15.830
What? I didn't hear you!

47:15.830 --> 47:17.260
I said lift it up!

47:18.710 --> 47:21.130
Don't use your hands! Lift up the rope!\NPulled tight!

47:21.130 --> 47:23.380
I was scared at first.

47:23.380 --> 47:26.070
It was a terrible time. It was a terrible time.

47:26.070 --> 47:29.030
Because of the softness...

47:30.240 --> 47:31.700
- Recruit!\N- Private Kim Hyunsoo.

47:31.700 --> 47:33.030
Bring me a glass of water.

47:34.710 --> 47:36.950
You made a joke.

47:36.950 --> 47:39.040
But it's not fun, huh?

47:39.170 --> 47:42.810
What's the word used in South Korea at times like this?

47:43.270 --> 47:44.810
That's what I did earlier.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.920
- Gap, Gapbungyo? Gapbungyo.\N- Gapbungyo.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.620
It's a sudden chill!

47:53.620 --> 47:56.640
Gapbungyo is all of a sudden, the atmosphere is like the principal!

47:56.640 --> 47:59.060
I'm gonna die comrade!

48:01.630 --> 48:02.690
Again!

48:03.620 --> 48:06.070
Comrade Li Yongho, let's do it again.

48:06.750 --> 48:08.310
What's the point of Moonsong?

48:08.570 --> 48:11.690
I'm sorry I was born liberal arts.

48:11.810 --> 48:12.850
Good.

48:13.570 --> 48:16.810
Next, Honbabian.

48:16.810 --> 48:18.140
Honbabian...

48:19.750 --> 48:23.330
Who eats alone?

48:23.420 --> 48:26.770
Good job. What's a Honkono?

48:27.310 --> 48:29.190
Who goes to coin karaoke alone?

48:29.190 --> 48:30.210
Good.

48:31.290 --> 48:32.560
Now.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.490
What's bondalbonjum?

48:36.920 --> 48:39.450
Stir-fry the chrysalis...

48:42.370 --> 48:43.760
Bondalbonjum!

48:43.760 --> 48:46.160
If you ask for a number, I'll give you a number!

48:46.160 --> 48:49.910
I'm gonna die!

48:50.270 --> 48:52.540
That's it, this life is end, this life is end.

48:53.180 --> 48:56.650
Really, really, that's really, really.

48:59.850 --> 49:00.760
Masang.

49:02.010 --> 49:04.480
- Heartbreak\N- My beloved people all over the country.

49:04.480 --> 49:07.540
Brave men and women of the People's Army, brothers and sisters.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.700
Dear, dear nation,\NDear nation.

49:11.700 --> 49:15.670
If the people's army of the Republic must recite a New Year message.

49:15.670 --> 49:17.130
Memorize it vigorously.

49:17.470 --> 49:18.780
The beloved people of the whole country.

49:18.780 --> 49:21.250
Brave men and women of the People's Army,\Nbrothers and sisters.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.020
Sergeant Park, put your hat on.

49:36.570 --> 49:38.100
It's a good match.

49:38.190 --> 49:40.700
Go as a private first class. What?

49:46.920 --> 49:48.300
Can you believe it?

49:48.300 --> 49:50.240
We're all in this together now.

49:51.740 --> 49:55.130
How can you not drink on a happy day like today?

49:55.180 --> 49:56.450
Comrade Choljin!

49:58.520 --> 50:03.120
Prepared the republic's most delicious rhododendron wine!

50:03.120 --> 50:06.090
I knew this would happen, which is why we've got drinks and food.

50:06.200 --> 50:09.420
I only prepared the most popular items of PX in the Republic of Korea.

50:14.110 --> 50:17.130
Okay, just a little bit more of the heavy flavor.

50:18.810 --> 50:20.890
Tie it up.

50:21.030 --> 50:23.960
DUDUDU.

50:24.240 --> 50:26.330
Now it's important. You watch it.

50:26.900 --> 50:28.110
Turn this end

50:30.830 --> 50:32.810
around!

50:35.190 --> 50:37.840
This is what makes tired soldiers want to eat.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.170
Taste it again.

50:41.900 --> 50:42.970
Give it to me.

50:56.800 --> 51:00.040
Let's have a candid conversation.

51:00.750 --> 51:04.310
It's all here. You know who's got the biggest ball?

51:05.860 --> 51:09.210
This is the bomb shelter.\Npublic water supply area.

51:09.770 --> 51:11.270
Stay.

51:11.660 --> 51:15.690
There is Panmunjom in North Korea and Peace House in the south.

51:16.150 --> 51:17.590
Then here.

51:18.800 --> 51:20.440
This is the back door to peace.

51:20.540 --> 51:22.010
The back door to peace?

51:22.010 --> 51:24.470
Is this make sense?

51:26.380 --> 51:29.700
This is the back door to future peace.

51:30.790 --> 51:32.160
Let's have a toast.

51:33.340 --> 51:36.520
- Come on, cheers\N- Cheers!

51:39.630 --> 51:40.960
Good!

51:50.570 --> 51:52.440
- My, my !\N- My turn! My! My!

51:58.670 --> 52:01.880
Hey, you just crossed the bridge.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.490
What did you say? The guy up there dumped you.

52:04.510 --> 52:05.990
Why are you so surprised?

52:06.360 --> 52:09.210
Is that how the South Korean president walked through Panmunjom?

52:11.400 --> 52:14.100
Okay, so our aggregate score is 1-0.

52:14.100 --> 52:15.400
- Now switch places.\N-Nice.

52:15.400 --> 52:16.650
Ah wait.

52:18.600 --> 52:23.320
Do you really want to change this?\NThis is North Korea.

52:30.020 --> 52:32.230
Have you been crying all night?\NSkip!

52:32.640 --> 52:33.810
Okay, let's skip it.

52:34.740 --> 52:35.780
Go, go.

52:38.170 --> 52:39.460
Ok ! Ok ! Focus!

52:40.510 --> 52:42.260
It's okay.\NYou're in the brig.

52:47.280 --> 52:49.690
But how old are you?

52:50.060 --> 52:52.200
In North Korean terms, I'm 29.

52:54.390 --> 52:55.850
I'm 32 years old.

52:56.900 --> 53:00.360
It's the big brother. You can speak freely.

53:00.450 --> 53:03.420
Ok? Let's get a cup from my brother.

53:05.300 --> 53:06.500
Yes, brother.

53:07.450 --> 53:10.330
But it seems your birth declaration was a lot late?

53:18.160 --> 53:19.620
I did it in time.

53:24.210 --> 53:27.180
What does Sergeant Park Chun-woo want to do when you become rich?

53:27.290 --> 53:29.640
I'm gonna start a farm. A cow farm.

53:30.060 --> 53:31.430
I graduated from the Department of Animal production.

53:31.430 --> 53:32.620
A dairy farm?

53:32.620 --> 53:36.360
Cows are pregnant for life to be milked.

53:36.360 --> 53:38.090
How inhumane.

53:38.180 --> 53:39.710
So I've decided.

53:39.770 --> 53:43.090
Cows need postnatal conditioning, too. I'm gonna start that farm.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.360
What will Corporal Lee Yong-ho do when you become rich?

53:51.530 --> 53:53.830
I have a lot of work to do.

53:54.850 --> 53:56.890
I want to buy a watch for dad.

53:59.320 --> 54:02.220
And my beautiful sister who sings well...

54:02.220 --> 54:04.800
Sister? Do you have a beautiful sister?

54:05.680 --> 54:09.470
Brother!\NWhat are you saying?

54:13.250 --> 54:15.530
South Korean television, the Internet.

54:15.570 --> 54:19.380
What scheming has been done to our republic there?

54:19.380 --> 54:21.440
You're supposed to be watching all day.

54:22.700 --> 54:25.280
It's like me. I use my monitor all day.

54:26.160 --> 54:29.630
Of all the networks and TV shows, do you know girl groups?

54:31.560 --> 54:33.030
No, you didn't know that, did you?

54:53.200 --> 54:56.550
Stop it, comrade Choljin!

55:10.630 --> 55:11.940
What are you doing?

55:14.530 --> 55:16.320
Hey, Seungil! Choi Seungil!

55:16.410 --> 55:17.900
You stupid.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.050
You've heard the American Yankee water?

55:24.360 --> 55:26.420
Did you go to a thought struggle?

55:27.100 --> 55:28.520
Comrade Political Instructor.

55:29.310 --> 55:30.580
Hey, Seungil.

55:32.680 --> 55:35.070
Please play it again Yongho.

55:35.390 --> 55:37.000
- What?\N- Play it!

55:56.640 --> 55:58.540
I love you.

55:58.540 --> 56:04.070
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'\NRollin' Rollin' Rollin'

56:04.600 --> 56:06.290
What are you all doing?Get out of here!

56:06.300 --> 56:09.810
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'\NRollin' Rollin' Rollin'

56:09.810 --> 56:11.330
Let's do it together! Let's do it together!

56:17.390 --> 56:24.170
Let's overcome the hardships and build a better garden!

56:24.170 --> 56:27.490
With a great general, we'll win!

56:41.100 --> 56:42.550
Because of the nature of GP work,

56:42.560 --> 56:45.240
Once deployed, no one can go outside for three months.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.280
Do you understand?

56:46.430 --> 56:47.560
Yes.

56:47.960 --> 56:49.490
You have to get sick to get out.

56:49.490 --> 56:50.500
I thought a lot about it.

56:50.610 --> 56:52.600
Drink stale milk a year out of date.

56:52.600 --> 56:54.010
Food poisoning?

56:54.010 --> 56:56.890
But the way to get out of cleanly.

56:57.310 --> 57:00.260
Whether it's your right arm or your left arm, only one of your arms is broken.

57:00.260 --> 57:02.580
You can get out.

57:05.410 --> 57:07.180
Pick one that you want.

57:08.440 --> 57:12.340
What would hurt the least?

57:12.900 --> 57:15.170
It's going to hurt.

57:15.810 --> 57:18.870
I've already told you about it.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.790
As soon as you get out, you'll be taken to the N.K. Capital Hospital.

57:21.790 --> 57:25.670
You're just gonna get a month's cast, all right?

57:25.760 --> 57:26.750
Loyalty!

57:31.380 --> 57:32.400
- This?\N- No, no.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.280
Then, with this?

57:34.680 --> 57:35.790
No, why...

57:36.040 --> 57:37.910
Okay, take it easy.

57:39.180 --> 57:40.870
- This, this...\N- A hammer?

57:40.880 --> 57:42.700
Yeah, it's one shot.

57:43.950 --> 57:45.350
Stone. That sounds clean.

57:46.520 --> 57:47.400
Oh.

57:48.570 --> 57:49.430
With small stone?

57:49.430 --> 57:51.250
No, this, this, this.

57:54.670 --> 57:56.730
Tell my mom I love her.

57:57.670 --> 57:58.780
OK.

58:00.410 --> 58:01.470
Sorry.

58:02.840 --> 58:04.910
1, 2!

58:12.740 --> 58:14.090
Where are you going to keep the lottery?

58:14.310 --> 58:16.040
I'll keep it in my wallet.

58:17.580 --> 58:18.940
You don't know anything about people.

58:19.150 --> 58:21.050
What if a thief stops us?

58:21.220 --> 58:22.680
So I'm ready.

58:23.320 --> 58:24.850
I was gonna talk back to you.

58:24.850 --> 58:27.150
I always thought a zipper would be better.

58:49.720 --> 58:53.670
He was a revolutionary soldier in white with a single shot.

58:53.670 --> 58:55.080
An unbeatable army!

58:56.420 --> 58:59.390
Strength of steel! The vigorous Brawler!

59:00.160 --> 59:02.680
A lightning charge into the enemy's fortress.

59:02.680 --> 59:06.230
One man can ruthlessly defeat hundreds of enemies.

59:06.360 --> 59:11.010
The attacking spirit of a hundred is special defeat.

59:12.090 --> 59:13.310
This time the training.

59:13.320 --> 59:16.990
Put the granite on the lower abdomen, with the big view far value of a hit immediately hit the training.

59:17.180 --> 59:20.110
I hear there's a new assignment this time, right?

59:22.120 --> 59:23.250
Who?

59:24.620 --> 59:25.700
The recruit!

59:30.250 --> 59:31.120
Out.

59:37.030 --> 59:38.900
In an indomitable revolutionary spirit.

59:38.910 --> 59:40.850
Give Dantian a little strength.

59:40.860 --> 59:43.460
Hit rocks with little belly!

59:47.750 --> 59:49.890
The beloved people of the whole country.

59:49.890 --> 59:53.330
Brave officers and men of the People's Army, brothers and compatriots.

59:53.330 --> 59:57.200
Today we all work hard and meaningfully.

59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.860
What they've done this past year to be proud of.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.690
Isn't this a New Year message from our comrade Chairman?

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.520
Have you learned all this by heart?

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:10.590
What are you guys still doing? Why don't clap, clap!

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:18.100
Okay, you need to wake up.

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:23.670
- Welcome to a hopeful New Year!\N- Got it. Wake me up.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.310
What happens when you get hurt?

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:33.020
If you get hurt, just put on a big sauce, otherwise you'll get smashed.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.600
Stop it!\NStop it now!

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:48.250
What are you doing?

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:51.450
Comrade political instructor, we are conducting basic military education and training.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.450
The recruit was assigned to the farm!

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.000
We don't need a drill!

01:00:57.850 --> 01:00:58.920
Is that so?

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.920
What's this?

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:10.680
Hey, recruit.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:13.430
Private Kim Hyunsoo.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.310
Hey, hey, get out, get out.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.600
I told you I had to do it by today, right?

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.320
- Sorry.\N- Sorry?

01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.030
Really...

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:23.950
- Stupid.\N- It's just...

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:25.400
New boy, let's go smoke.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.590
Out!

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:46.110
You bring Masang?

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.170
Are you hurt.

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.860
No.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920
Really?

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:00.350
Really, for real.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.090
It's okay. Yeah.

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:09.710
Don't think of this life as a failure.\NIt's all small but certain happiness.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:13.270
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.900
You're not part of our unit.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.680
Give me.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.970
Give me.

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.310
How can you spit on it?

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.460
It's so hard.

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.320
Stop it. Just.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.080
That's amazing.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.250
You didn't use shoe polish, but it's glossy.

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:34.200
What's your secret?

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.130
What's the secret..

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:41.210
In life, there's a guy who doesn't want to waste his shoe polish.

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.990
Now, spit it out.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.740
What's wrong with your tone?

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:56.680
Did you sprain your leg?

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.990
You must have sprained your leg, it hurts.

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:04.420
I don't know anything. I miss my mom every night.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.970
So you're an animal doctor.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:10.060
I heard what Comrade Lee Yongho said about 645.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.490
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, okay.

01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:14.490
What about Korea?

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.800
Don't look down on me.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.210
Go away! A duck that can't even lay an egg.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.390
Can't ducks lay eggs?

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.900
I don't know what the problem is. It's not breeding well.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.160
The farm thrives when eggs are hatched and young are born.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:34.830
Looks like I came to the right guy.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.750
I majored in animal production and mating.

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:40.120
Atmosphere is important when it comes to breeding success.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.190
Atmosphere?

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.960
You have to respect her personal life.

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.790
The partitions and lighting should also be emotional.

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:49.860
It would be better if there was music\Nlove songs and stuff like that.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.540
There's one of my favorite songs.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.510
It's that song.

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:06.060
- Live with the moon and stars.\N- Live with the moon and stars.

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:13.420
- Paradise of feeling.\N- Paradise of feeling.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:20.360
- You live with me\N- You live with me

01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:27.750
- This earnest heart\N- This earnest heart

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:38.990
Comrade Yeon-hee.\Nwelcome.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:42.000
Comrade Youngchul, how have you been?

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.050
It's long, but who is this ggonsam?

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:50.050
I'm Choi Jung-nam, a newly assigned farm management soldier.

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:52.130
You two say hello.

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:20.940
Good night..

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.900
Stop moving! Stop moving!

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.920
It's a mine.\NEverybody back off.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.360
You, you! Don't move!\NDon't move, you punk!

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:01.060
Contact the home squadron! Contact the demining team!

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:01.900
- Yes, sir!\N- Yes, sir!

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.990
Then it'll be late.

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:04.560
Everyone, step aside.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.500
- This is what we planted.\N- No...

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.610
It's a wooden-box mine planted by North Korea.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.210
- The radius of the kill is 3m.\N- Get back off!

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:17.820
About 5m?

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.730
It explodes when you step on it or open the lid.

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.810
Remove the safety pin before opening the lid.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.210
It was like I'm in a detached situation.

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.090
Yeah?

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:34.620
After eating 100 sweet potatoes, I was really depressed.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.540
Everybody on the ground!

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.550
- Get down!\N- Get down!

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.360
Get down!

01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:10.850
Get down?

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.470
- Applause!\N- Applause!

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.830
It's a miracle, Comrade!

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.450
One night, you're gonna have to pack 100 eggs.

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:58.750
The duckling lays one egg every 10 minutes.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:02.550
Rabbit, pig, you're going crazy.

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:06.420
The food problem in our republic has finally been solved!

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.550
Wow, you just showed up?

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:15.270
It will come at a time of hardship when millions of people starve to death.

01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:17.439
What took you so long to show up?

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.720
Comrade Choi Jeong-nam.

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:28.819
You're a nation's talent that comes out once in a thousand years!

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:29.760
No.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.680
I recommend Comrade to the cadre training school at once!

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:35.649
Battalion commander, Battalion commander comrade!

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:39.649
Comrade Choi Jung Nam is a rookie who just got assigned to the squad.

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:41.859
- There's still a lot to learn..\N- Shut up!

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.029
It's already decided. Send him to a senior training school right now.

01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:52.000
What do you mean by going to a school?

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.500
There is a military academy in South Korea, but there is no military academy in North Korea.

01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:59.420
If anyone gets a letter of recommendation,

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.220
You're chosen to go to a training school for cadres.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:02.890
When?

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:04.770
You're leaving the day after you got the letter of recommendation.

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:05.850
Where?

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:08.740
Where else to go? Pyongyang.

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:11.950
Congratulations. I've never been there before in my life.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.460
Wake up!

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.340
That's the only car you can drive.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.800
How's it going?

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.240
I don't know what it is, but I got it all back.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.320
I got rid of it.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.620
The repairs will take at least three or four days.

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:42.190
- The...\N- Go for broke..

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:43.560
Well done.

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:47.120
Let's go. There won't be a miracle, will there?

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:08.710
Listen to what I'm saying.

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.670
That being the case, you crossed the line.

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.230
I want to go home.

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.360
Do you know what Pyongyang is?

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.820
Places you can't go if you want to.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.820
Comrade Chunwoo, take this opportunity to change your fate.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.210
I want to go home.

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:31.690
Why?

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:34.370
Make the carts and the ducks fly?

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.360
I'm screwed.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.970
Loyalty!\N437 Cheif, Kang Eunpyo!

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.730
Where you can't even get an ant near you...

01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:52.930
Where?

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.250
Who do you mean?

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:56.840
Heroic soldiers who give themselves to remove mines!

01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:57.900
Where!

01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:01.710
That, Sergeant Ha...

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:06.300
Did the G.P. Experience soldier go on duty?

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.460
In the dining room.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.600
To the dining!

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.150
Stand at attention!\NAbout Captain..

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.490
Sit down and eat.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:20.880
Is it him?

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.110
Excellent. That's the soldier.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.660
I have a good hunch.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560
Is it you?

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.640
The soldier you removed the mines and saved the lives of your comrades?

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:38.950
Yeah?

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.290
Department, department, official...

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.160
- Attention.\N- Right.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.740
You really enjoyed your meal.

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:50.630
Well, is there anything about military life that's inconvenient?

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.380
- Yeah.\N- Yeah?

01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:02.160
Ok, where is your hometown?

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.410
Up there, Ham...

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.980
Ham? Ham?

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:10.810
Ham? Ham where?

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.350
It's Hamburg.

01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:22.100
Hamburg?

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.390
Germany's Son Heung-min SV... Hamburg?

01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:28.060
Yes.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.820
The model soldier I've been looking for is right here, huh?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.460
A true soldier who gave up his foreign nationality to fulfill his noble military duty!

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.210
Yeah, well, what's your resolution?

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.870
He gave up his foreign nationality and tried to become a Korean soldier.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.750
Tell me!

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:50.980
In German.

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:53.840
German...

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:16.350
Comrade Lee Yongho, one in a million.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.320
I wish I didn't have to use this.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.320
I've memorized everything now.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.720
You should've seen this more than 100 times.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.700
I am a Korean.

01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:52.190
Did you understand?

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.390
Yes.

01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:55.110
Translate.

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.860
Give up German citizenship and choose Korean citizenship.

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.140
It's not anything special, right.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.690
Because you only get one chance to defend your country.

01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:37.690
The most advanced guard task that no one can complete.

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:47.680
I had the confidence that I could do anything.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.140
If you ask me why, I'm just gonna say this.

01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:12.950
I am a proud Korean.

01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:27.410
Brother...

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.380
Stand up!

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:40.240
Applause! Applause!

01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:48.330
That's right! That's right!

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:50.950
Hey, this is a moving eco-friendly car.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:17:02.974
Upload by adm820@gmail.com

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:26.640
Stop! Stop!

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.360
This is by order of the Legion's political department

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.140
They postponed the transfer of Choi Jung-nam to an executive school.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.550
Film the revolutionary recipe for increasing food production.

01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:49.070
All outposts have priority spread!

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.870
I submitted the plan to the Legion's political department.

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.650
I used a little trickery.

01:17:57.690 --> 01:17:58.990
Thanks.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.980
It's all I can give you.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.750
Make no mistake, this is all because of me.

01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:17.980
Comrade Youngchul told me, you don't have to worry.

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:24.080
Hey, I'm curious. Can I ask you something?

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.520
- Of course.\N- Wouldn't it be...

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.420
You know that fart guy?

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:31.850
It's that guy.

01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:35.530
Every time I'm on the air, I'm gonna break your mouth.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.150
When I see a guy that good-looking.

01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:39.440
Break his leg.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.750
You can jump rope with a rubber band on.

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:45.020
Never get too close to this unbeatable bastard.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.230
Yes.

01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:49.490
Yes.

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.870
What many people want to know is this.

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:02.150
That's why mating is so combative.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.510
Please introduce the special secret of Comrade Choi Jeong-nam.

01:19:07.930 --> 01:19:11.510
To increase milk production from cows.

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:13.810
The important thing is to rub it.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.940
Wipe! Is friction more important than anything else?

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:24.260
Just pinch the breast of the cow like this.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.040
Use stroking to relieve accumulated chest muscles.

01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:33.740
Come on, everybody, look this way. Come on, squeeze like this.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.550
Hold it like this.

01:19:39.450 --> 01:19:41.070
Like this?

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:43.050
- From the top...\N- Show me.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.370
Stop eating.\NYou're going to become a real pig.

01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:59.670
Pig..

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.960
You're good.\NGood, meticulous.

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:34.300
The chickens on our farm laid 645 eggs this morning.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:37.290
Very good news.

01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:40.830
What's the secret to success in this battle?

01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:44.070
Love.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.170
It was love.

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.180
Yes, it is love.

01:20:58.130 --> 01:21:00.440
What, love?

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.610
I'm gonna go out.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.860
Yeonhee, I...

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.380
Lee Yongho?

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:21.890
Seohyeon Station on the Bundang Line.

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:26.510
The moment you get out of the Armed Forces Capital Hospital,\Nyour life-long mission begins.

01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:28.600
Take the subway.

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:30.770
The subway is the safest.

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:33.790
And don't make eye contact with anyone.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:37.970
Don't ever.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:19.430
Get in.

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:25.770
Guard officer, you wanted to see me?

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:30.240
Hey, Yeonhee, sit.

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.880
I called you because I wanted to talk to you.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.990
Is there anything inconvenient about the work of the Corps propaganda team?

01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:42.170
Let me know

01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:45.850
if you do.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.130
No, I'm happy with it

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:52.110
What is this?

01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:55.300
This is an oil lotion I bought with dollars not long ago.

01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:02.090
It smells so good. I think of Comrade Yeonhee

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:07.680
Oh, and I bought a nice bottle of wine.

01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:10.470
It's ok.

01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:17.750
And there is no reason to receive such a gift from a comrade security instructor.

01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:22.330
Why do you keep doing this? Didn't you say you were gonna help me?

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.560
Don't!

01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:30.650
You girl don't understand me?

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:41.170
You seem to watch a lot of movies, guard officer.

01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:42.460
What?

01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:47.430
That's what they do to make people fall in the movies.

01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:49.430
Can women do this?

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.130
But movies and reality are different.

01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:56.170
At the outpost of the revolution.

01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.880
You are so partisan.

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:01.220
Yeonhee!

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:05.340
Bearing the heavy responsibility of national reunification

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.700
An elite member of the legion Propaganda team!

01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:10.650
It hurts.

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:13.430
Are you gonna make me look like some asshole in heat?

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.320
What age is it now, God damn it.

01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:32.040
What the hell are you doing here?

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:35.620
Yeah, I'm just passing through...

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:38.090
Let's have a cup of coffee. Let's go.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.380
Yes.

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:43.140
There are brokers in front of the head office of the Agricultural Cooperative.

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.540
The winner will be subject to a tax deduction of around 30%.

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:49.040
These brokers do it to launder money

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.130
After deducting about 20 percent of the funds, they propose cash transaction.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.670
But they're all liars.

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:58.330
If he gets caught, he might just take the lottery.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.440
You have to watch out for the brokers.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:05.250
If you go to the bank, go to the petition police immediately.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.810
There's a special elevator that lotto winners can take.

01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:15.450
Go to the police and take the elevator.

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.070
That's it. That's the end of it.

01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:24.130
Come in.

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:27.250
Psycho soldier brother.

01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:32.160
- What's up?\N- Come.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.730
- Why are you doing this?\N- You have a daughter.

01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:36.220
Do you understand the heart of parents?

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:39.310
- Psycho soldier!\N- What's wrong?

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:41.750
Ah!

01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:44.440
Psycho soldier?

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.240
What's this?

01:25:48.650 --> 01:25:50.520
Manchul? Why are you running away?

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.000
He hasn't found money yet?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.220
What are you doing in Seoul?

01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:01.840
Money, did you find the money?

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.180
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:07.300
You punk!

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.520
Aren't you answering the phone?

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.580
What should I do?

01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:22.900
Let's go have a cup of stick coffee.

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.500
- Let's go.\N- Yes.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.660
Choi Seungil, 645, 500,000.

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:11.120
Lee Yongho, 645. 750,000.

01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:20.150
Choi Jung Nam on June 16th.

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:26.710
16th, no soldiers came in?

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.370
Our Republic's Hero.\NChoi Jung-nam, Comrade.

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:41.960
What are you saying? Is there anything uncomfortable?

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.950
No.

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:44.980
Comrade Choi Jeongnam. Where are you from?

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:46.510
Ham...

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.150
Ham, where?

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:51.120
It's Hamheung.

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.880
Nice to meet you.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.730
I'm from Hamheung, too.

01:27:54.730 --> 01:27:57.150
I'm also from Hamheung. What part?

01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:59.830
I mean, um...

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:04.870
I thought you were the hero of the Republic of Korea.

01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:07.620
But it turns out.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.630
A traitor to the nation.

01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:14.680
Get in.

01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:21.420
Comrade Yeonhee, come here.

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.270
I found something interesting today.

01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:27.590
Comrade Lee Yong-ho said that Comrade Yeon-hee was an enemy?

01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:28.860
Yeah.

01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:34.190
But our comrade Lee Yongho has not been seen recently.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.320
Do you know Yeonhee?

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.690
Did he happen to cross the Military Demarcation Line?

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:45.140
Running south.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.360
Comrade security instructor.

01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:52.570
Who are you?

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:56.830
The hero of the Republic, Choi Jeong-nam, was a ghost from the beginning.

01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:58.440
Who are you?

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:04.100
You bastard!\NWho are you!

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:09.920
I am proud

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.860
- Republic of Korea Army Sergeant\N- You son of a bitch!

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:16.420
Rebel of the Republic! South Korean reactionary spy!

01:29:16.730 --> 01:29:19.040
Your face looks white and clean.

01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:21.120
Ever since you started calling the balls.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.710
- I asked around, you son of a bitch. - Calm down.

01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:23.800
Bastard, I...

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.270
I'm gonna kill this bastard today! I'm gonna die, too!

01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:29.500
Comrade Yeonhee, give me that gun.

01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:31.220
Give me that gun!

01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:32.650
Let go of this!

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.530
What's going on?

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.900
Comrade political instructor.

01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:50.190
It's here.

01:29:51.190 --> 01:29:54.470
We need to revise our plan and head south now!

01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:55.670
Comrade political instructor.

01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:57.650
I'll contact the south side. All right.

01:29:57.730 --> 01:30:00.110
Move to the public water supply area now!

01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:01.920
How are you going to get here?

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.180
When the guard instructor wakes up, one of them has to die!

01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:08.990
Comrade Yeonhee.

01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:13.220
I used to be a special instructor!

01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:15.750
A special instructor who went all the way to the Middle East.

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:18.710
Don't worry.\NTake him

01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:22.070
and go, quickly.

01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.190
Oh...

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:29.650
- You have to go, you have to go!\N- Hey, wait...

01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:40.300
Take it.

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:51.150
The situation is urgent, the identity of Chunwoo comrade was found.

01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:54.310
Wait, wait.

01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:56.540
Wait.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.110
The young boar was in a lot of trouble.

01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:03.310
Does the boar especially not follow you?

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:07.180
When you look at this handkerchief, you're bound to think of us.

01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:12.850
On the way back, please let the boar return to its mother's arms.

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:18.900
Yeah.

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:22.400
Go easy, Comrade Jeongnam.

01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:31.880
Quick go to! Don't get hurt! Go find Mom!

01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:34.680
Go. There's no time.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.590
Yeon-hee, is it ok that I'm going?

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.660
I'm fine. Just go.

01:31:50.150 --> 01:31:52.190
Hello, Comrade Kim Kwang-cheol.

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:57.810
You have two choices.

01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:02.360
A chance to enjoy good fortune after receiving a large sum of money.

01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.110
Another is..

01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:08.730
You and I are not getting away with this.

01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:12.860
One of us

01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:21.220
is gonna die here.

01:32:30.710 --> 01:32:35.680
If you assemble the gun first, you're a dead man.

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:41.440
But you're really out of luck.

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:47.880
I was a member of the 525th Special Operations Group,\Npart of the Operations Directorate of the General Staff of Neray.

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:54.150
AK47, SR-25.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:59.350
M9 Beretta, Glock 17.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.680
I've won every fire I've touched in a while!

01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:06.110
Is that so?

01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:13.500
But I'm not gonna die under a gun.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.790
38th Aviation Army Regiment under\Nthe Reconnaissance General Bureau of the People's Armed Forces.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.230
I came from a sniper brigade.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:27.250
Comrade Kim Kwang Cheol.

01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.640
Choose well.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.350
Quick.

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:58.790
Why are your hands so disobedient?

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.380
Okay, your exit pass to the Capital Hospital of the Founding Army.

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:21.920
Depart from Sohyeon Station on Bundang Line on 14:00.

01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:25.010
Transfer to Line 3 at Seonneung Station, Line 2.

01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:28.180
Transferred from Jongno 3-ga to Line 5 again.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.890
Arrived at the Nonghyup headquarters at Seodaemun Station.

01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:33.140
Good, very good.

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:37.910
By the way, 15:30\NAre you suddenly leaving the Nonghyup headquarters?

01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:42.610
At 15:48. Buy and eat at Gwanghwamun.

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.390
Buy a lottery ticket at 16:01.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.290
Eat soondae at Euljiro 3-ga.

01:34:52.290 --> 01:34:57.540
Why do you buy a hot dog\Nand an Americano at Jonggak Station?

01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:01.570
Why do you go to the playground after looking at the bicycle repair shop?

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.900
Yeah, 5 minutes ago. Hwangga's kalguksu.

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.790
You got caught.

01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:13.830
Yes, it's a kalguksu restaurant.

01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:18.180
Who?\NMr. Pervert?

01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:21.250
Excuse me, is there a pervert among you?

01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:23.680
Mr. Pervert Soldier!

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:26.990
You got a call. Please answer it.

01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:30.560
Come on.

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:40.880
- Hello, communications security...\N- Hey, you punk!

01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:42.470
Did you find the money at the bank?

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:45.330
Why are you angry? I got kicked out!

01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:46.280
What?

01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:54.110
Maybe, lottery?

01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:09.650
- Is this the right place?\N- Yes, that's right.

01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:12.820
Hey, Chunwoo.

01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:14.890
- Brother!\N- Yeonhee.

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.600
- Comrade Yeonhee!\N- How did you know this place?

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.910
It's a long story.

01:36:19.230 --> 01:36:21.980
You okay?\NAre you hurt?

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:25.970
- You okay?\N- Yes.

01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:29.530
Seungil is late.\NWhat happened?

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:33.090
By the way, did you find the money?

01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:35.180
Comrade Manchul is all right to come?

01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:36.890
The fool.

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:51.360
I sent him to 645.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360
How dare you do this to my only sister?

01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:55.540
You son of a bitch! Say it!

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.400
What trick did you do?\NTalk about it!

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.100
What's the matter, brother?

01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:00.710
Comrade Lee Yongho! Calm!

01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:03.300
I told you it wasn't like that!

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.520
Hyung? Why am I your Brother?

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.170
If you're a year older, you're older than me!\NSo you call me brother-in-law?

01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:09.290
Brother-in-law?

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:12.000
You son of a bitch or an asshole?

01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:12.930
Shit!

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:20.090
The client didn't do anything. What are you two doing?

01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:24.430
I'm my idea whether you like me or not. I'm not a toy.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.780
Yeah, well, if you take a closer look, they're all right.

01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:29.460
Loosen the collar at once.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.880
Thank you, Yeonhee.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:42.080
Shut up!\NYou didn't do anything right either!

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.140
Yes.

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.870
- Kim Manchul!\N- Manchul!

01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:50.450
Loyalty!

01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.420
TOD Observation Soldier Kim Man-chul.

01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:58.290
Mission accomplished, safe and sound.

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:12.700
Hey, how did you find this? I heard you couldn't get to the bank.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:16.010
Isn't the first prize in this lottery paid out of the account?

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.980
So right from the start, you can cash it in a day.

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:20.690
It's an impossible plan.

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.900
The bonus wasn't actually drawn at the bank.

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.370
The prize money.

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.270
I was there to find him.

01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:32.380
Mr. Rich Soldier, yes.

01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:41.200
Don't you think the country got too much in taxes?

01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:43.350
Yeah, that's crazy.

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.650
The civil servants.

01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:49.700
I want to see something.

01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:51.740
Yes?

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.900
The thing.

01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:59.210
Not bad.

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.320
What you doing?

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.040
She said she wanted to see something.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.390
Who said anything about wanting to see your stuff?

01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:10.560
Things! The real thing! Cha! Why is that?

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.590
Are you out of your mind?

01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:12.670
- Hands on pants...\N- No. no.

01:39:12.670 --> 01:39:16.020
- No, no.\N- Are you crazy? People are so fucked up these days.

01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.010
- No...\N- Hey, you pervert.

01:39:18.490 --> 01:39:22.950
Enough is enough!\NPlease.

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:35.570
I put a zak here.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.350
-Disgusting.\N-That psycho Kang Eun-pyo

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.780
- Let me.\N- Yes.

01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:46.480
Do you know how nervous I get every time I go to the bathroom?

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.190
What if it gets wet?

01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:54.670
If you lose and the bank doesn't pay you.

01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:55.750
That is not.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:58.850
It's not just money.

01:39:58.850 --> 01:40:01.340
No, what's the point of giving four days and three nights off?

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.550
I'm coming to Seoul now.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.970
What should I do when I come to Seoul?

01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:09.980
All right! All right!

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:11.280
No, I'll show you everything.

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.100
No I don't want to.

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:13.630
- What's going on with this...\N- No, I don't look.

01:40:13.630 --> 01:40:14.890
- No, close the ...\N- This is outrageous.

01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:16.980
Does that make sense to you?

01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:19.330
Why are you yelling at me?

01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:23.220
Aunt Popeye at the South Gate loan shark?

01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:25.160
What is Popeye?

01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:28.450
Just eat spinach and his eyes roll.

01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:31.990
American imperialist with his fists at will.

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.550
Popeye has a terrible name.

01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:40.720
Yeonhee, Yeonhee,Yeonhee.

01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:45.470
Don't move.

01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:49.400
Back off!

01:40:52.530 --> 01:40:53.860
Comrade security instructor!

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.910
It's made in America!

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.070
Four million dollars!

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:05.630
We can share this!

01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:08.790
- Yeah.\N- Split it, you and me?

01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:11.360
Why?

01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:14.350
- Brother.\N- Comrade security instructor!

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.120
This is 645 of peace.

01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:23.460
It's a sign from heaven that North and South Korea\Ncan share in peace and harmony.

01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:25.300
Hello, Peace?

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.990
Are you still in a romantic mood?

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.790
What peace? Do you want to be beaten half to death?

01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:34.580
One of two has to die!

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.240
Real peace came.

01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:38.980
OK!

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.680
Stupid.

01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:47.200
You think I don't know?

01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:51.860
I know it all.

01:41:57.690 --> 01:41:59.280
What are you doing?

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.990
That's our money. Put it down.

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:03.220
Stay!

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:07.360
What are you guys doing? Do something!

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.310
Okay, I'll kill you.

01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:13.170
I'll kill you in one go.

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.090
Soldiers of the North and South, goodbye.

01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.860
What's that?

01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:10.730
Hey, you fucking boar! Stop!

01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:13.820
Stop! Hey, boar!

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:16.460
Comrade Choljin, follow quickly!

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.880
Come here! Don't even eat that!

01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.800
Hey, you boar!

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:29.150
My money!

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.810
Don't shoot me! It's me!

01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:34.070
How's it going?

01:43:34.190 --> 01:43:35.510
The mine exploded.

01:43:35.670 --> 01:43:40.000
Comrade Guard instructor flew into the sky.

01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:41.700
And the money?

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:44.430
The boar took it all.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.850
It's all over.

01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:49.590
Fxxk...

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:51.280
Brother.

01:43:56.410 --> 01:43:57.790
It's all over.

01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:01.170
He's 645.

01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:04.410
It was ridiculous from the start.

01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:09.210
Let's go back.

01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:11.810
What the hell have we been doing?

01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:13.530
Wait! Wait!

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.590
Hey what you doing now?

01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:23.380
No, Sergeant Park! It's not like that. It's not like that.

01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.900
- You son of a bitch.\N- Get your hands off me, Man-chul! Get your hands off me!

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.070
Yes, I want it down! I want it off!

01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:28.110
Take it out! Take it out!

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:29.820
Done!

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:32.070
Huh? Why is that coming out there?

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.510
Mister, this, this, this.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:34.810
Right, right.

01:44:36.210 --> 01:44:37.350
Here?

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.910
- What's this?\N- Can you...

01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:42.100
Right, right.

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:45.830
Manchul...

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.460
Manchul!

01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:50.350
This, this.

01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:56.040
I didn't put anything in bag.

01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:59.020
I brought another $400,000 with me.

01:44:59.450 --> 01:45:00.720
Manchul!

01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:02.250
Manchul!

01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:06.090
So this is reversed.

01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:07.860
There's a twist!

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:08.960
Yes, yes.

01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:12.260
Kim Man-chul is on a reward vacation right now!

01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:13.520
Thanks.

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:18.990
Yeonhee.

01:45:20.050 --> 01:45:21.810
- Chunwoo!\N- One, bucket plant, stone three, raccoon.

01:45:21.810 --> 01:45:24.350
- Squid, beef soup, Turkey, octopus\N- How much?

01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:30.760
Here's $400,000.

01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:35.610
I was kind of... running over here.

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:42.990
But if it's $400,000 it's still a lot of money.

01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:44.770
Of course. $400,000.

01:45:44.770 --> 01:45:47.130
So if you split it in half, that's $200,000.

01:45:48.490 --> 01:45:50.110
About 200 million won.

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.610
If it's 200 million to 15 percent.

01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:53.490
30 million won?

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.980
I can pay the piano and pay my mother's medical bills.

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:04.600
But for that money you could buy100 false teeth made in Switzerland.

01:46:05.230 --> 01:46:08.620
Are you gonna let me in, too?

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:12.000
Of course you do.

01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:17.630
Yeonhee.

01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:30.480
Don't forget my account number.

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.830
All right, I'll text you.

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:41.270
Comrade Chunwoo, good job these days. Goodbye.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.550
Will we see each other again?

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.670
What are we gonna do when we meet again?

01:46:47.170 --> 01:46:49.460
We can see each other when we're unified, right?

01:46:51.850 --> 01:46:52.830
Right.

01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:56.700
Let's all be united and pray.

01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.090
Unification is nothing.

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:03.390
All you can see when you want to is unity.

01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:26.520
Yeonhee.

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:31.760
Now it's time to leave.

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:34.710
Be safe.

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:41.650
Everything you do goes well, and make a lot of money.

01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:44.310
Please grant your wish.

01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:46.670
Make sure you open a farm.

01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:49.870
There must be glory in all things.

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.450
I hope Yeon-hee can become a successful singer.
