- Did Rose lose
her phone privileges?

I haven't heard from her.
- I don't know.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.087
The Guardians handle
their own punishments.

you through political tutorials

03:00.555 --> 03:01.890
- The best way
to get their vote

03:01.931 --> 03:03.808
is for them to think
you're their new best friend.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.686
- Fine, but this entire thing
is ridiculous.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.480
- What's ridiculous is you
not wanting to be queen.

- Why would I want
to do something

to do?

This was Andre's thing,
not mine.

- I think we can both agree
that you're no Andre.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.366
- Mia.
- Sorry.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.409
- If only he were still here,
right?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.245
Then you'd be queen,

03:24.287 --> 03:26.956
and everyone would still
be hopeful about the future,

03:26.998 --> 03:28.583

Everyone is hopeful
about the future.

You're unsullied
by faction politics.

Everyone's excited about you,

03:38.385 --> 03:40.720
at least, everyone who matters.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.391
Now I need to head
to the Council.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.394
Everyone's gathering to discuss
your Specialization Ceremony.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.062
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.856
It's just a nice gentle way
to get campaign season started.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.067
Everyone loves

But Dragomirs are

Hey, Mia?

04:12.168 --> 04:14.004
When your sister
didn't specialize,

04:14.045 --> 04:15.880
my parents never told me
why the Council

04:15.922 --> 04:18.299
finally stopped insisting
that she try.

04:19.634 --> 04:23.054
- By the time
they were done with her,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.347
even if she did specialize,

04:24.389 --> 04:26.933
she wouldn't be capable
of using it.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.449
- Bite me.
- What if I could?

04:42.490 --> 04:44.784
- Alberta's got me doing
double chores.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.786
Maybe that's punishment enough.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.873
- While Lissa got off clean,
typical.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.292
- How in the hell did
this queen thing happen?

04:52.334 --> 04:55.295
Lissa's the least political
person in the Dominion.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.880
She's got to be freaking out.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.965
- You haven't talked to her?
- No.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.301
The dorm matrons
keep blocking her calls,

05:01.343 --> 05:02.969
and I can't get
anywhere near her

05:03.011 --> 05:05.597
because fucking Dimitri
is keeping us separated.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.433
- Maybe Lissa likes the idea
of being queen.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.976
- I doubt it.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.944
Everything sucks.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.115
Including this couch.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.618
It's hard as a board.

[squelching]

06:06.241 --> 06:07.826
- Now, as you can see,

06:07.867 --> 06:09.786
the Strigoi's eyeball
has a high number of rods

06:09.828 --> 06:12.288
for better night vision,
like a cat.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.958
And the quadrate bone
down here,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.085
allows the Strigoi
to unhinge its jaws

06:17.127 --> 06:18.628
like a snake.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.755
Now, their limbic system,

06:20.797 --> 06:23.633
the area in the brain
responsible for behavior is--

06:23.675 --> 06:25.677
is practically microscopic.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.721
So from this, we can deduce
that they are incapable

06:27.762 --> 06:29.723
of possessing true conscience.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.558
- How do we know that
for certain?

06:31.599 --> 06:33.143
- Because we listen to science.

06:33.184 --> 06:37.605
- Okay,
but has anyone ever actually,

06:37.647 --> 06:39.983
I-I don't know,
sat down and asked one?

06:40.025 --> 06:42.485
[soft laughter]

06:42.527 --> 06:44.237
- I'm curious too,

06:44.279 --> 06:46.656
Guardian Tanner,
how does a Moroi

06:46.698 --> 06:48.950
become a Strigoi again?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.410
- There's no need
to repeat lessons

06:50.452 --> 06:51.745
taught in the lower schools,
Jesse.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.330
- No, I-I think
we could use a brushup.

06:54.372 --> 06:58.168
One, a Strigoi turns you
by feeding you their blood.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.546
Two, you accidentally kill
while you feed

07:01.588 --> 07:04.591
and must pay for the mistake
with your soul.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.760
Does anyone know number three?

07:08.553 --> 07:10.055
Anyone? Ozera?

07:10.096 --> 07:12.807
- That's enough, Jesse.
Class dismissed.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.477
- Three, you choose to kill.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.771
You choose to suck
all of the blood

07:17.812 --> 07:19.522
out of their body
while you feed,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.024
to be a monster.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.526
Just like Mommy and Daddy,
eh, Ozera?

07:27.238 --> 07:29.157
- Hey, Meredith.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.575
I need a favor.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.995
Can you pass Lissa
a note for me?

07:34.037 --> 07:36.289
- [laughs] No way.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.665
- Why?

07:37.707 --> 07:38.917
What's the big deal?

07:38.958 --> 07:41.670
- Strategically,
this is a no-win situation

07:41.711 --> 07:43.129
for both of us.

07:43.171 --> 07:47.008
I get caught, I get demerits,
I'll lose standing,

07:47.050 --> 07:48.093
and for what?

07:48.134 --> 07:49.803
- To do something nice
for a friend.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.138
- We're friends now?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.556
You don't get it, do you?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.433
If they are separating you now,

07:55.475 --> 07:56.643
it's probably
just to prepare you

07:56.685 --> 07:58.228
for what's to come
when she's queen.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.813
- We're a package deal.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.272
Everyone knows that.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.652
- Have you ever met
a Royal Moroi

08:05.694 --> 08:07.529
in a high position of power

08:07.570 --> 08:09.989
with a Dhampir best friend?

08:11.866 --> 08:14.035
- And you wonder
why we aren't friends.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.163
- Rose?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.792
There's no easy way
to say this.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.086
Um, the issue of you and Lissa

08:23.128 --> 08:25.880
sneaking outside the wards was
raised at the Royal Council.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.174
There's going to be a tribunal,
and the dean will preside.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.678
- A tribunal?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.722
So what, they wanna ship me off

08:33.763 --> 08:35.473
to St. Jude's
or some other school?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.852
- They aren't deciding where
you should go to school, Rose.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.812
They want to determine
if you have a future

08:40.854 --> 08:43.398
as a Guardian at all.

I'd like to check it
against the Strigoi

10:11.945 --> 10:13.863

10:15.740 --> 10:17.992
Seems more than a normal

I've been saying.

Not that anyone on the Council

Very rare.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.803
When Sonya Karp
didn't specialize,

11:59.844 --> 12:03.223
first they sent her
to the High Priestess,

12:03.264 --> 12:05.266
then counseling,

12:05.308 --> 12:06.559
then they sent her away
to some place

12:06.601 --> 12:08.728
for electric shock therapy.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.981
It took her years to be close
to normal again.

She's not even Royal.

of immaturity

for your own failings.

I'm not the one

I could feel your panic.

25:03.753 --> 25:04.796

25:04.838 --> 25:06.798

in five minutes,

25:06.840 --> 25:08.466
I either need to walk
on that stage

25:08.508 --> 25:09.884
and hope to hell
that I specialize,

25:09.926 --> 25:12.262

to flee the Dominion.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.847

25:27.235 --> 25:29.446
Do you really think
you can't do it?

25:31.031 --> 25:33.283
- I don't know.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.952
Maybe it's just the nerves

25:35.994 --> 25:38.246
or the grief or the panic

25:38.288 --> 25:41.249
because I know that once I do
go out there and specialize,

25:41.291 --> 25:43.335
I'm one step closer
to becoming queen,

25:43.376 --> 25:45.253
which I never envisioned.

25:45.295 --> 25:48.298
- I guess you just have
to ask yourself

25:48.340 --> 25:51.343
if this is something
that you want.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.554
- Part of me just wants
to be free.

Living somewhere where no one
cares what element I am,

25:57.682 --> 25:59.309

25:59.351 --> 26:00.685
- That's perfect.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.021
We can disappear
among the humans.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.023
I mean, that was always
the plan anyway, right?

26:05.065 --> 26:06.608
- Well,
minus the fugitive part.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.902
- Oh, yeah,
just a small detail.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.488
- But then the other part of me
is thinking about everything

Andre was gonna mean
to this Dominion.

26:14.115 --> 26:17.452
A leader who ruled not just
for the Royal Moroi,

26:17.494 --> 26:20.705
but for all its citizens,
including the Dhampirs.

26:20.747 --> 26:24.000
He was gonna make this
a place you wanted to run to,

26:24.042 --> 26:25.335
not away from.

26:25.377 --> 26:28.797
And if I disappear,

26:28.838 --> 26:31.716
what happens
to my brother's legacy?

26:31.758 --> 26:34.928
There are a parade of people
dying to be on the throne

separating this Dominion

from that fate is me?

26:48.400 --> 26:49.943
- Well, I think...

26:54.072 --> 26:59.285
I think that Andre would be
so proud of you right now.

26:59.327 --> 27:02.747

nothing you can't do.

all what you've got.

38:32.145 --> 38:34.481
What are you doing here?

38:34.522 --> 38:36.399
- Why didn't you tell me
about the tribunal?

38:38.401 --> 38:40.612
- Who told you?
- Dimitri.

38:40.653 --> 38:42.030
- Fucking Dimitri.

38:42.072 --> 38:43.782
It was none of his business.

38:43.823 --> 38:46.409
- Well,

38:46.451 --> 38:47.619
you get to stay.

38:49.037 --> 38:50.538
I mean, you're still

How?
- Well, it turns out

38:58.380 --> 39:00.382
there is an upside
to being almost queen.

39:00.423 --> 39:02.384
People have to listen to you.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.886
You can thank Dimitri
for telling me.

39:04.928 --> 39:06.513
He carried you here, you know,

39:06.554 --> 39:08.390
in those big,
manly arms of his.

39:08.431 --> 39:10.517
- What kind of macho shit
is that?

39:10.558 --> 39:12.227
- He said you passed out
at the bar.

39:12.268 --> 39:13.728
How many shots did you have?

39:13.770 --> 39:15.063
- One.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.107
I gave the rest to Mason.

39:20.110 --> 39:22.696
I didn't pass out
from drinking.

39:22.737 --> 39:24.447
I passed out from kissing.

39:24.489 --> 39:27.033
- Mason?
- Christian fucking Ozera?

39:27.075 --> 39:28.201
- What?

39:28.243 --> 39:29.911
- You were kissing
Christian Ozera,

39:29.953 --> 39:32.247
and therefore, for some reason
I can't really explain,

39:32.288 --> 39:34.582
I was kissing him too.

39:34.624 --> 39:36.042
I was in your head.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.794
- Okay.

39:37.836 --> 39:39.087
Okay, this is crazy.

39:39.129 --> 39:40.588
We need to figure this out.

39:40.630 --> 39:42.215
- No shit.

39:57.230 --> 39:58.898
- For all the perks
of being Moroi,

39:58.940 --> 40:00.483
that must be annoying.

40:00.525 --> 40:01.651
- It is.

40:03.528 --> 40:04.487
Mm.

40:10.076 --> 40:11.202
Thank you.

40:11.244 --> 40:12.871
I fell asleep and got caught.

40:12.912 --> 40:15.206
- What brings you to the wrong
side of the tracks?

40:15.248 --> 40:17.834
- I'm the confidant
of the future queen.

40:17.876 --> 40:20.003
Where she goes, I go.

40:22.797 --> 40:24.007
What happened to your arm?

40:24.049 --> 40:26.009
- Rose Hathaway had a bad day.

40:26.051 --> 40:27.719
- Rose Hathaway is a menace.

40:27.761 --> 40:29.554
- Gets me out of training
for a few days.

40:29.596 --> 40:31.973
- What Guardian doesn't
enjoy training?

40:32.015 --> 40:33.475
- This Guardian.

40:34.976 --> 40:37.312
I prefer to fight with words.

40:39.064 --> 40:41.024
- I'll bear that in mind.

40:43.109 --> 40:45.445
- I'm Meredith.

40:45.487 --> 40:47.072
- I know.

40:48.490 --> 40:49.908
- We'll get
to the bottom of it,

40:49.949 --> 40:52.118
but Warden Mia is out there
waiting to escort me home.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.703
You gonna be able to sleep?

40:53.745 --> 40:55.372
- Probably.

40:55.413 --> 40:58.750
If your brother would stop
haunting my dreams.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.669
- Wait, what?

41:00.710 --> 41:02.671
- Every time,
it's the same one.

41:02.712 --> 41:05.674
You're outside alone.
You see a dead body.

41:05.715 --> 41:07.717
Andre's there,
and he tells you to--

41:07.759 --> 41:08.718
- Remember.

41:11.221 --> 41:13.682

- The Strigoi
that we've encountered lately

41:32.075 --> 41:33.827
haven't just been
opportunistic.

41:33.868 --> 41:36.287
They've been planning.

41:36.329 --> 41:39.249
- Strigoi don't plan.
- What if they do?

41:39.290 --> 41:42.544
What if they've been
testing the wards?

41:42.585 --> 41:44.212
If they find a weakness
in the magic

41:44.254 --> 41:46.089
that reenforces
the walls of the city,

41:46.131 --> 41:48.091
the entire capitol
could be compromised.

41:48.133 --> 41:50.010
We'd be at risk of attack.
