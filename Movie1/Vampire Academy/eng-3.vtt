Dhampir numbers
were already down.

Now with the massacre

As it is, there aren't enough

the one's we've lost.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.834
- What would you have us do?

- I'll leave the short-term
solutions to the council,

02:50.920 --> 02:54.257
but for the long term,
I implore you

02:54.299 --> 02:56.343
to emphasize to the community

02:56.384 --> 02:58.887
the necessity
of the special relationship

02:58.928 --> 03:01.681
between Moroi and Dhampirs.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.351
Fewer new Dhampirs
means fewer Guardians

03:04.392 --> 03:06.603
to protect us in the future.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.146
- You mean

Please.

to fuck more.

03:20.325 --> 03:25.205
- The massacre at St. Jude's
was unthinkable.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.124
All were taken too young.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.752
All will be mourned.

we will celebrate

the traditional Death Watch

03:40.136 --> 03:42.389

We also mourn the loss
of the Dhampir Guardians

03:46.101 --> 03:48.395

03:48.436 --> 03:52.232

Without Dhampirs,
no Moroi life can be safe.

a moment of respect

That's my old school.
- Oh.

Except for Xavier,

I mean, Xavier and I
weren't friends.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.415
He wasn't a nice guy.

he was gonna pay

05:53.561 --> 05:56.564
Except... about that.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.528
There's something strange
happening

06:01.569 --> 06:03.697
with me and Rose.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.074
This is a little weird, um...

06:07.617 --> 06:09.285
So Rose has always had
a good sense

06:09.327 --> 06:11.204
of how I'm feeling.
- Right.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.748
- Only lately,
it's been kind of amped up.

06:13.790 --> 06:19.129
And last night, she saw us--
well, you--

06:19.170 --> 06:21.381
through my eyes
when we were kissing.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.508
- What?
- Kissing?

06:24.968 --> 06:27.554
We have places to be,
and kissing an Ozera outcast

06:27.595 --> 06:29.931
is not something
that can happen ever.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.725
My father's
not gonna like this.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.393
- Then don't tell him.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.436

to tell him.

- No.

He's not gonna let you ruin
your shot at being queen.

What is she doing here?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.969
- The only way to deal
with the massacre at St. Jude's

07:50.011 --> 07:53.473
is to learn from it and prevent
it from ever happening here.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.141
To walk us
through what happened,

07:55.183 --> 07:58.645
I am honored to introduce
our most decorated Guardian,

07:58.687 --> 08:00.605
Janine Hathaway.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.941
- Your mom is such a badass.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.111
- The Strigoi attack
on St. Jude's was unique,

08:06.152 --> 08:07.654
in my experience.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.115
There are exits...

08:10.156 --> 08:12.742
here and here.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.536
Tell me what you see.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.956
- The pattern
of the bodies indicate

08:17.997 --> 08:19.833
that they were herding
the victims

08:19.874 --> 08:22.377
and killing them in groups.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.546
- The Strigoi are loners.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.674
They occasionally hunt
in twos or threes,

08:27.716 --> 08:28.967
but they turn on each other

08:29.009 --> 08:30.844
as easily as they do
on their victims.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.762
Your thesis
would contradict centuries

08:32.804 --> 08:34.681
of behavioral analysis.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.683
Do you stand by it, Miss...

08:36.725 --> 08:39.310
- Meredith.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.354
You see, that's what's odd.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.314
Historically,
Strigoi don't fight this way.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.485
But to me, it looks like
the attack was coordinated.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.195
- Good.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.322
You're looking at the facts
without bias,

08:51.364 --> 08:53.366
which is the only way to draw
the right conclusion.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.951
Nice work, Meredith.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.371
In the past, the Strigoi's
inability to cooperate

08:58.413 --> 09:00.457
has protected us.

09:00.498 --> 09:04.794
But these Strigoi, at least,
seem to be working together.

09:04.836 --> 09:08.757
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

She's a badass.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.011
But it's very performative.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
And why is she here anyway?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.599
Is it to see
if I'm okay or scared

09:17.640 --> 09:19.726
after the other school
got attacked?

09:19.768 --> 09:22.812
No, she's here to show us all
how smart she is.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.273
- Okay, let's not let her
get you distracted

09:25.315 --> 09:26.608
from research mode.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.360
We need you out of my head.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.904
- And I need her out of mine.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.280
- My schedule is wall-to-wall

09:32.322 --> 09:33.823
leading up
to the Death Watch tomorrow,

09:33.865 --> 09:35.075
but I talked to Christian,

09:35.116 --> 09:36.910
and he's gonna help us
figure things out.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.704
- I hope you're right
about being able to trust him.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.498
- I am.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.791
I know we only just met,

09:42.832 --> 09:47.253
but I feel like I know him
and he knows me.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.924
Maybe it's the fact
that we both lost our parents.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.343
Maybe it's just chemistry,
but he's smart,

09:53.385 --> 09:56.554
and we don't need you passing
out during practice.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.014
We can trust him.

09:58.056 --> 10:01.059
I know it.
It's like a gut feeling.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.686
- I would argue you on that,

10:02.727 --> 10:05.021
but I can feel it
coming off of you.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.815
- Well, what does it feel like?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.276
- I don't know.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.070
Warm.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.197
Centered.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.616
A little gooey.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.868
You like him.
- I do.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.499
- You know I want you
to be happy,

10:24.541 --> 10:27.335
but Christian is a non-starter
for a lot of people

10:27.377 --> 10:29.504
if you want to be queen.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.090
- Yeah, I know.
I'll be discreet.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.425
Now that I've committed
to this,

12:34.754 --> 12:37.132
I would think of a couple ways
you could thank me.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.885
- Don't worry, I'll find a way.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.100
- I hate to intrude
on the lovebirds,

12:47.142 --> 12:49.102
but I'm next
on your dance card, Rose.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.691
[wincing, grunting]

12:54.733 --> 12:56.276
- Romantic enough for you,
Eddie?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.069
- Oh, come on,
it's too early for this.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.575
- Recover first, then strike.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.871
- Watch your blind spot.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.917
- Elbows in, lateral hip twist
and follow through.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.884
- Nice, Mason.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.678
- Point to Mason.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.804
- [groans]

13:24.846 --> 13:26.389
- You have to open up.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.559
Let him come to you,
use his momentum.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.856
You need to calculate
your speed. Again.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.900
- You wanna show me,
just show me.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.361
- Have it your way.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.157
Come at me.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.621
- [grunts]

13:56.044 --> 13:57.337
- I'm fine.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.632
<i>- You're overreacting.</i>

14:00.674 --> 14:03.259
- Sonya and I believe it's time
to strengthen the wards, sir.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.512
- We still have two decades
left on the enchantment cycle.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.263
- The Strigoi could find
a way to break through

14:07.305 --> 14:08.973
as the enchantment
gets older and weaker.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.767
Maybe that's what happened
at St. Jude's.

14:10.809 --> 14:11.976
- Is it?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.353
- They're looking
into Dhampir error,

14:13.395 --> 14:15.105
which is code
for they don't know.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.648
We want to take our evidence
to the queen

14:16.690 --> 14:18.650
and the council tonight.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.568
- Who's gonna listen to you?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.195
- Mia.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.197
- I'm sorry, but you're going
to need something more credible

14:24.239 --> 14:26.658
than the word of a Dhampir
and the Bird Lady.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.663
- I'll handle it, Sonya,
I promise.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.003
[bell tolling]

14:55.020 --> 14:56.604
- Why did you do that
to yourself?

15:02.277 --> 15:05.113
You have one
of the greatest Guardians alive

15:05.155 --> 15:07.240
giving you advice,

15:07.282 --> 15:09.951
and if that's not enough luck,
she's your mother.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.411
- She gave birth to me,

15:11.453 --> 15:13.705
but I wouldn't call her
my mother.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.166
- Some people might be proud
to be her daughter.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.502
- I so don't want to hear this
right now.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.962
- Then hear this.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.424
If you want to be number one,

15:24.466 --> 15:26.968
when someone of her caliber
gives you advice,

15:27.010 --> 15:28.636
take it.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.228
I know how much you want this.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.651
- Rose. Over here.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.489
It's not a request.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.374
<i>- This is insanity.</i>

15:57.415 --> 16:00.418
Ward-strengthening ceremonies
take months to plan.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.587
- And who's gonna perform
this rite?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.214
The handful of monks
who are capable

16:04.255 --> 16:05.465
are halfway around the world,

16:05.507 --> 16:07.467
prepping the next
properly scheduled ceremony.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.219
- That's true,
but many of them were taught

16:09.260 --> 16:11.262
by High Monk Edward Junge.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.056
He's been practicing the rites
all his life.

16:13.098 --> 16:18.687
- [chanting in Old Moroi]

16:18.728 --> 16:21.690
[echoing thud]

16:21.731 --> 16:25.318
- You know the Guardians aren't
the only protection we have.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.115
- It's too dangerous.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.158
You remember how badly
it went last time.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.576
- They were still
experimental then.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.121
- And they haven't been tested
since.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.082
- While the monk prepares,

16:39.124 --> 16:41.292
we need to protect ourselves.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.294
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.171
Does anyone have
a better idea?

16:46.965 --> 16:49.217
- I'm sorry,
I know I'm new here,

16:49.259 --> 16:50.969
but could someone
please tell me

16:51.011 --> 16:52.679
what you all are talking about?

16:52.721 --> 16:54.681
- Psi Hounds.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.226
Guard dogs created
to only obey Moroi commands.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.520
They patrol the wards
for signs of Strigoi,

17:00.562 --> 17:02.689
except they don't know
when to quit.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.692

[hounds baying]

17:18.705 --> 17:19.873
<i>- It was awful.</i>

17:19.914 --> 17:21.374
The last time they let
the Psi Hounds out,

17:21.416 --> 17:22.625
they tore through
an entire farming village

17:22.667 --> 17:24.127
outside the gates
before wrangling them

17:24.169 --> 17:25.420
back into their cages.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.505
- I tried to say something,
but I'm new,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.090
so why would they listen to me?

17:29.132 --> 17:30.884
- You're gonna have to navigate
the council sooner or later,

17:30.925 --> 17:32.677
now that you're head of family.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.512
Is that the mask you're wearing
to the Death Watch?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.472
- Yeah.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.102
Which one do you want?

17:41.144 --> 17:42.854
- Must be nice, Lissa.

17:42.896 --> 17:46.232
Living by your own rules,
oblivious to the real world.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.026
The Death Watch
is for Royals only.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.402
- Wait, what?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.449
Mia...

17:56.534 --> 17:58.870
- Don't let her get to you.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.247
Girls like her only exist
to make other people

18:01.289 --> 18:03.416
feel bad about themselves.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.335
- I had no idea the Non-Royals
were excluded.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.671
Non-Royals died
at St. Jude's too.

18:07.712 --> 18:11.341
- Hmm, this Dominion
and its traditions.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.551
- You're Tatiana Vogel, right?

18:13.593 --> 18:16.096
I should know that.
I'm sorry.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.514
- No.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.140
I didn't grow up at court.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.267
My mother sent me here
a few months ago

18:21.309 --> 18:23.436
to study religious studies
with my aunt,

18:23.478 --> 18:25.689
High Priestess Irene.

18:25.730 --> 18:29.150
But I was a friend
of your brother, Andre's.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.111
He knew the council
needed to modernize

18:31.152 --> 18:33.279
or the young Moroi
will never engage.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.782
That's why you
are what we need.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.702
You have the power
to change things,

18:38.743 --> 18:40.829
even now.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.372
- Not really.

18:42.414 --> 18:45.959
- Even small actions can make
a big difference.

18:46.001 --> 18:50.505
And whether you wear
the crown now or later...

18:50.547 --> 18:53.383
you're either a queen
or you're not.

- Princess Valilissa,
are you looking forward

19:06.688 --> 19:08.773
- Not as much as I should be.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.109
Our whole community
has been affected

19:11.151 --> 19:12.610
by the recent attack,

19:12.652 --> 19:14.738
Royals and Non-Royals alike.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.614
Tonight should be
for all of us.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.117
And when I'm queen,
that will change.

just because I let

20:07.165 --> 20:10.085
spoiled rich boys bite me,
I don't have a life of my own?

20:10.126 --> 20:12.712

You mean Blood Whores?

20:15.006 --> 20:17.676
Hmm, well.

It's better than being
a breeding factory

20:22.347 --> 20:26.059
- As opposed to this...
exalted position?

20:26.101 --> 20:27.519
- A girl's got to eat.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.658

- You have a very thick skull,

21:26.286 --> 21:28.538
so listen up.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.291
Dhampir women have two choices,

21:31.332 --> 21:32.876
to be a Guardian,

21:32.917 --> 21:34.878
or to be part
of a Dhampir commune

21:34.919 --> 21:37.505
with one job:
procreate with a Moroi.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.925
- You're not even gonna mention
the third choice?

21:40.967 --> 21:44.137
- Being a Blood Whore living
by your wits is no choice.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.806
- I've heard the horror stories
about the communes,

21:46.848 --> 21:49.893
but at least the mothers there
actually mother.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.812
- Yes,
they get to parent their kids.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.356
But they also have
to be available

21:54.397 --> 21:56.483
to the Moroi men who show
interest in them.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.234
That's their duty,

21:58.276 --> 22:00.820
to birth more Dhampirs.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.448
- Maybe those women
like that life.

22:03.490 --> 22:07.035
They get to see their kids
instead of facing down Strigoi.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.995
- Maybe some do.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.413
And if there were
other options,

22:10.455 --> 22:12.999
and they still chose that,
good for them.

22:13.041 --> 22:16.002
But there are plenty
who don't want to be there.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.505
- Point taken, Janine.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.965
Next time you wanna talk,
maybe we could wrestle.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.022

of an ancient magic

22:36.064 --> 22:37.691

22:37.732 --> 22:39.109
- Is that why you summoned me?

- Look.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.615
"The apocryphal text outlines

22:53.248 --> 22:55.375
I think Lissa can do this.

Okay, she told Mia
to do something,

23:03.550 --> 23:05.552

No one says
where this power comes from,

23:19.274 --> 23:22.152
and as far I can tell, there's
only one book that does.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.319
- Where is it?

23:23.361 --> 23:25.739
- High Priestess' archives.

where that was.

I can sneak us in later,

at the Death Watch,

- If you're digging
for a thank-you,

24:10.909 --> 24:12.702
I'm not in the mood.
- No.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.997
Mia, I'm actually just trying
to be a nice person.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.866
Let's get there early
so we can watch it all go down.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.536
- Are they talking about me?
- Mm-hmm.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.624
- Did I do something wrong?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.459
- If you did,
the queen will most certainly

25:01.501 --> 25:03.753
let you know about it
publicly.

I'm sure everything

25:24.691 --> 25:27.318
- I can't believe Lissa.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.320
- She's gone too far.

for this.

No more surprises

26:27.712 --> 26:30.423
Can I invite the Non-Royals
in here with us?

26:30.465 --> 26:32.842
- It is a little stuffy
in here.

Most of us have lost someone.

30:01.134 --> 30:05.096
The wards weren't breached.
They were disarmed.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.765
- It was an inside job?

30:08.892 --> 30:10.852
- And there's more.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.148
You were at the school
for two years

30:15.190 --> 30:17.233
and you haven't spoken
to a single student

30:17.275 --> 30:19.402

- I find that highly unusual.

because I'm "unusual,"

30:21.780 --> 30:22.864

30:22.906 --> 30:24.741

Distant cousin

33:26.214 --> 33:28.758
- The worst part for me
about my parents

33:28.800 --> 33:31.386
is that everyone thought they
were awful to grow up with,

33:31.428 --> 33:33.221

sitting in our cabin
at Mont Blanc,

33:43.106 --> 33:45.400
hanging out, skiing.

33:45.442 --> 33:47.610
Then next,
they chose to become Strigoi.

33:47.652 --> 33:50.780
They chose that over me.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.157
Then, when I thought
they were dead,

33:52.198 --> 33:55.076
I--I didn't know how to feel.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.746

They led the massacre
at St. Jude's.

about to be queen.

37:38.466 --> 37:40.802
And the queen's

which means you either be
Lissa's Guardian

38:08.955 --> 38:12.208
or her friend, not both.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.836
- You know
what your problem is?

38:14.878 --> 38:17.088
You think that just because
something's been one way

38:17.130 --> 38:20.216
for a long time,
that it has to stay that way.

38:20.258 --> 38:22.594
But if this is the way
the world is,

38:22.635 --> 38:26.348
then maybe it's the world
that needs to change.

38:26.389 --> 38:27.849
- Maybe you should ask
your friend Dimitri

38:27.891 --> 38:29.351
if I'm right.

38:37.567 --> 38:40.195
<i>- None of your Blood Whores</i>
<i>for this.</i>

38:40.236 --> 38:43.031
If you're gonna fuck
a Dhampir, do it right.

38:43.073 --> 38:46.868
I chose this one myself.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.203
Do your duty.

38:52.248 --> 38:53.792
- Let's get this over with.

<i>[eerie music]</i>

39:30.161 --> 39:32.122

39:44.259 --> 39:45.552
Fuck!

39:46.553 --> 39:48.346
Oh, fuck.

40:01.151 --> 40:04.070
<i>[somber music]</i>

40:04.112 --> 40:11.244
<i>* *</i>

40:44.027 --> 40:46.905
- [gasps]
- Hi.

40:46.946 --> 40:48.740
- I didn't think you'd come.

40:48.782 --> 40:50.075
All these people.

40:50.116 --> 40:51.868
- I had to tell you
what Rose and I found.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.161
Rose and I were researching

40:53.203 --> 40:54.496
a way to get you
out of her head.

40:54.537 --> 40:58.333
The stuff we found
is from 600 years ago.

40:58.375 --> 41:02.087
It talked
about a fifth element.

41:02.128 --> 41:04.089
- But that's not--

41:04.130 --> 41:05.715
There's four elements.

41:05.757 --> 41:07.634
- That we know of.

41:07.676 --> 41:10.929
I think you're someone
who actually specialized

41:10.970 --> 41:12.347
but just doesn't know it yet.

41:18.561 --> 41:21.272
I think you specialized
in something called Spirit.

41:23.358 --> 41:25.360
- I've never even heard
of that.

41:25.402 --> 41:27.529
What you're saying
is blasphemy.

41:27.570 --> 41:29.739
- Which is why
you can't tell anybody.

41:34.202 --> 41:36.371
You really are a unicorn,

41:36.413 --> 41:38.873
but unicorns are rare

41:38.915 --> 41:40.500
and need to be protected.

41:43.044 --> 41:44.587
- What do you mean?

41:50.385 --> 41:51.761
- You'll hate me for this.

41:53.430 --> 41:55.432
But you and I
can't be together.

41:57.559 --> 41:58.727
I'm sorry.

42:06.776 --> 42:08.820
- The queen has summoned us
immediately.

42:18.913 --> 42:22.292
- Each one of the 12 lines
on the board

42:22.334 --> 42:25.295
represent each
of the 12 Royal families.

42:25.337 --> 42:28.840
Every sphere represents
a member of that family.

42:28.882 --> 42:31.217
This, princess, this is you.

42:31.259 --> 42:33.803
And this is the Dragomir line.

42:33.845 --> 42:35.764
We've only just learned

42:35.805 --> 42:38.350
the attack on St. Jude's
resulted in the death

42:38.391 --> 42:40.268
of two of your second cousins.

42:40.310 --> 42:42.687
- Without them,
you lack a quorum.

42:42.729 --> 42:45.231
Without a quorum,
you cannot vote,

42:45.273 --> 42:47.442
much less sit on the throne.

42:47.484 --> 42:49.277
- I've never heard
of this rule.

42:49.319 --> 42:50.612
- Neither had I.

42:50.653 --> 42:52.947
It is an ancient law
that hadn't been enforced

42:52.989 --> 42:54.324
since before my reign.

42:54.366 --> 42:56.201
- Then why start now?

42:56.242 --> 42:58.953
You're the queen.
You decide.

42:58.995 --> 43:00.830
- I have decided.

43:00.872 --> 43:04.417
Laws are laws,
and we cannot disregard them

43:04.459 --> 43:07.170
simply because
they're not favorable to us.

43:07.212 --> 43:10.298
The princess's--

43:10.340 --> 43:13.635
Lady Dragomir's only task now

43:13.677 --> 43:17.097
is to stay alive
and rebuild her bloodline.

43:17.138 --> 43:19.808
Nothing more.

43:19.849 --> 43:21.434
On the bright side,

43:21.476 --> 43:24.979
your monk is preparing to lead
the ward strengthening ceremony

43:25.021 --> 43:26.189
at sunset tomorrow.

43:26.231 --> 43:28.566
It won't be
our usual extravaganza,

43:28.608 --> 43:31.361
but it should give us
some additional protection.

43:33.196 --> 43:35.782
I'm sorry, Vasilissa.

43:35.824 --> 43:39.619
You would have made
an excellent queen.

43:39.661 --> 43:40.995
- Marina.

43:41.037 --> 43:43.873
If you yourself
had never heard of this law,

43:43.915 --> 43:45.250
who alerted you to it?

43:50.964 --> 43:52.173
Do you know what you've done

43:52.215 --> 43:54.217
with this ancient quorum rule
of yours?

43:54.259 --> 43:56.302
- Mind your tone, Victor.

43:56.344 --> 43:57.679
This is a sacred place.

43:57.721 --> 44:00.724
- You've set us back centuries.
- Or forward.

44:00.765 --> 44:03.560
Because now there's room
for another new, fresh voice,

44:03.601 --> 44:07.856
someone a bit more vibrant.

44:07.897 --> 44:10.025
- [scoffs]

44:10.066 --> 44:11.693
You?

44:11.735 --> 44:13.611
Let me be clear.

44:13.653 --> 44:15.822
I'd sooner die than see

44:15.864 --> 44:17.532
your family's bloodline
on the throne.

44:17.574 --> 44:20.201
- Perhaps the saints
will grant you your wish.

44:20.243 --> 44:23.163
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

44:23.204 --> 44:30.337
<i>* *</i>

44:39.262 --> 44:40.680
- Have you seen my mother?

44:40.722 --> 44:41.973
- She left.

44:42.015 --> 44:44.184
She has her next assignment
to get to.

44:44.225 --> 44:45.977
- It figures.

44:46.019 --> 44:49.230
Just scorch the earth,
threaten me with communes,

44:49.272 --> 44:50.857
and then leave.

44:53.026 --> 44:54.444
I'm behind.

44:58.114 --> 45:00.116
So it's none of my business,

45:00.158 --> 45:05.914
but I saw you with a woman
in town and a baby,

45:05.955 --> 45:07.457
and I don't know...

45:09.084 --> 45:11.920
I shouldn't even be asking.

45:11.961 --> 45:14.964
- Her name is Eloise.

45:15.006 --> 45:16.633
The little boy is Alexei.

45:20.136 --> 45:21.429
- Alexei?

45:21.471 --> 45:25.517
The cute baby
who taught you about honor?

45:25.558 --> 45:28.853
- Alexei was Eloise's husband

45:28.895 --> 45:30.105
and my best friend.

45:30.146 --> 45:33.441
I was his Guardian.
The baby is their son.

45:33.483 --> 45:36.319
- They were married?

45:36.361 --> 45:39.114
- Alexei was
an influential Royal,

45:39.155 --> 45:41.908
so people looked the other way.

45:41.950 --> 45:44.994
- You were best friends
with a Moroi?

45:49.833 --> 45:52.127
How did he--

45:52.168 --> 45:53.670
How did you lose him?

46:01.678 --> 46:04.180
- He was always on at me...

46:04.222 --> 46:06.766
to take care of myself

46:06.808 --> 46:08.935
in the small ways
a Guardian can.

46:10.603 --> 46:13.940
Draw clear lines
between my life and the job.

46:16.192 --> 46:19.612
Take the time off in the rare
moments it was offered.

46:22.407 --> 46:24.826
So that's what I did.

46:24.868 --> 46:29.456
And then his convoy
was attacked by a Strigoi

46:29.497 --> 46:31.041
on a trip across the provinces.

46:34.210 --> 46:35.879
And I wasn't there.

46:37.172 --> 46:41.176
- And then Eloise got sent
to the communes to...

46:41.217 --> 46:42.719
breed.

46:51.728 --> 46:56.149
I want everything
he wanted for you.

46:56.191 --> 46:59.444
I want to do my sworn duty.

46:59.486 --> 47:02.113
I want honor.

47:02.155 --> 47:06.326
I wanna protect my best friend
from danger.

47:06.368 --> 47:10.121
And I want a life
to call my own.

47:10.163 --> 47:14.793
My mother thinks Guardians
can't have that.

47:14.834 --> 47:18.755
And I'm starting to wonder
if that's true.

47:22.342 --> 47:25.887
- I think Janine...

47:25.929 --> 47:29.516
is one of the smartest women
I know.

47:29.557 --> 47:30.850
But...

47:33.061 --> 47:36.690
I would never bet against you,
Rose Hathaway.

47:41.528 --> 47:42.987

47:43.029 --> 47:45.448
For it to work...

47:45.490 --> 47:47.701
I need to be as good as you.

47:51.329 --> 47:52.789
Will you teach me?

47:57.669 --> 48:02.424
- If I were to teach you,

48:02.465 --> 48:03.925
you'd have to take it
as seriously

48:03.967 --> 48:07.303
as every other official class.
- I would.

48:07.345 --> 48:10.015
- And you'd work
on my schedule.

48:10.056 --> 48:11.099
- I would.

48:13.810 --> 48:16.021
- And no talking back.

48:16.062 --> 48:17.939
- Mm...

48:17.981 --> 48:19.566
That last one.

48:27.449 --> 48:29.451
- I'm here to see Silver.

48:29.492 --> 48:32.495
- Sorry, Lord Zeklos.
You're banned.

48:32.537 --> 48:33.705
- You're joking.
