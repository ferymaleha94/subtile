WEBVTT

00:13.722 --> 00:16.683
<i>- There's something strange happening</i>

00:16.725 --> 00:17.809
<i>with me and Rose.</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:20.061
Remember!

00:20.103 --> 00:22.647
- Don't freak out.
- Okay.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.401
That's, um, new.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.779
I'm actually a Spirit User
just like St. Vladimir.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.531
<i>When I become queen,</i>

00:31.573 --> 00:33.742
we'll know if someone is an
incompetent fighter.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.784
That's a lie.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.286
<i>He was one of the best.</i>

00:36.327 --> 00:38.413
Mikhail Tanner betrayed us

00:38.455 --> 00:41.041
by allowing himself
to be turned Strigoi.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.170
<i>Guardians follow orders, Rose,</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:46.338
<i>or the system crumbles.</i>

00:46.379 --> 00:48.048
The system is broken.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.716
I have to follow orders.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.593
I don't.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.011
Lady Vasilissa,

00:53.053 --> 00:54.763
the last Dragomir.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.222
I'm Adrian, by the way.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.807
So what do you know
about Saint Vladimir?

00:57.849 --> 00:59.976
I can help you,
but only if you come back.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.728
Wake up.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.063
You Dream Walked.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.064
You're a Spirit User.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.315
You up for an adventure?

01:05.357 --> 01:07.317
Get some of those answers
that you want.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.069
<i>I know you're hurting.</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:10.820
And I'd do anything
to make it stop.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.751
<i>Once there were 13 saints.</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:29.172
<i>Today, their children's
children's children</i>

01:29.214 --> 01:31.257
<i>are called Royals.</i>

01:31.299 --> 01:33.385
<i>But they were saints
back then,</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:35.428
<i>the best of the Moroi.</i>

01:38.348 --> 01:42.310
<i>And the best of the saints
was Vladimir,</i>

01:42.352 --> 01:47.190
<i>the Messenger, the Founder.</i>

01:47.232 --> 01:49.109
<i>It was Vladimir
who had the vision:</i>

01:49.150 --> 01:51.111
<i>a world for the Moroi,</i>

01:51.152 --> 01:54.614
<i>secret and isolated
from the barbarous humans</i>

01:54.656 --> 01:58.159
<i>with their wars of religion,
wars of conquest,</i>

01:58.201 --> 02:00.036
<i>wars of intolerance.</i>

02:00.078 --> 02:04.082
<i>And that vision was embodied
in the human treaty,</i>

02:04.124 --> 02:08.795
<i>which gave all Moroi a home
and gave all Dhampirs</i>

02:08.837 --> 02:14.009
<i>a purpose in the great,
holy Elemental Order.</i>

02:14.050 --> 02:15.802
<i>You know this story.</i>

02:15.844 --> 02:18.096
<i>It's the one they tell
children in the academies</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:20.098
<i>and in Feast Day homilies.</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:23.309
<i>It's the first great lie.</i>

02:23.351 --> 02:27.188
<i>The happy lie of St. Vladimir.</i>

02:34.404 --> 02:37.907
<i>- But the truth will come out
because the truth always does.</i>

02:42.287 --> 02:44.080
Shh.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.755
<i>And woe unto us if we
let the lies make us forget</i>

02:51.796 --> 02:55.759
<i>the real dangers out there
because they are out there,</i>

02:55.800 --> 02:58.845
<i>and they are very, very real.</i>

03:19.032 --> 03:21.451
It is time, Your Majesty.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.453
The hope we had for unanimity
from the Council

03:23.495 --> 03:25.955
has gone by the wayside.

03:25.997 --> 03:29.042
Yes, because of my
daughter's outburst.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.877
But we need to act.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.004
The only way we'll get
a clear and decisive mandate

03:33.046 --> 03:34.881
is if you lead us there.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.510
You need to declare for me.

03:40.595 --> 03:44.641
They are so beautiful
after a feed.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.977
I know they say it is
the outrush of chemicals

03:48.019 --> 03:50.980
in their brain that
our bite releases,

03:51.022 --> 03:54.067
but there is a part of me
that always believed

03:54.109 --> 03:57.862
we take their cares
along with their blood.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.913
I hate the idea of an
Elementalist on the throne,

04:06.955 --> 04:09.749
especially Tatiana Vogel.

04:09.791 --> 04:14.754
Happily, by my count,
even after last night's fiasco,

04:14.796 --> 04:16.923
if you bring the three
more persuadable

04:16.965 --> 04:18.758
heads of family home--

04:18.800 --> 04:22.429
Abby Batista, Peter Tarus,
and Evette Ozera,

04:22.470 --> 04:24.597
you should have a majority.

04:24.639 --> 04:28.476
Six to five--
that is enough for a win.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.021
- Yes, but--
- No, Victor.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.190
I cannot mandate this.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.235
There was a moment in the wake
of Andre's death, yes,

04:37.277 --> 04:41.906
but now, all our hatreds and
troubles are out in the open.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.453
The only way to hold the throne
is to win the crown,

04:46.494 --> 04:50.790
legitimately
and without my help.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.418
You have until
tonight's closing caucus

04:53.460 --> 04:56.463
to get your votes.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.256

Gotcha.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.038
Cheater.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.749
There's no way
that you beat me here

05:32.791 --> 05:37.087
and set up an ambush unless
you scouted ahead of time.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.173
Recon is just basic
perimeter control.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.842
You said we were going blind.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.304
Suddenly, Rose Hathaway
is a believer in rules.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.557
Or maybe
you've been scouting out

05:49.599 --> 05:51.559
secret places to get me into.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.710
Rose?

06:21.131 --> 06:23.383
Uh-huh.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.427
I need a favor.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.724
The risk of even
one more person knowing, Lissa.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.684
Yeah, after he just
walks into my dream

06:32.726 --> 06:34.060
and makes himself at home?

06:34.102 --> 06:37.647
Rose, Adrian Ivashkov
and I are in the same boat.

06:37.689 --> 06:41.276
I know of three
confirmed Spirit Users.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.902
Vlad went Dark.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.655
I might be losing my mind,
and the last one--

06:45.697 --> 06:47.282
Is a stone drunk,
from what I hear.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.658
A self-medicating drunk

06:48.700 --> 06:50.910
who drinks to keep
the Darkness at bay.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.871
But he might have answers,
and right now,

06:52.912 --> 06:54.664
I need answers
more than I need lectures

06:54.706 --> 06:57.625
about how scary it is.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.795
Because I might end up
the same as Adrian

07:00.837 --> 07:04.924
if I don't find another way of
keeping the Darkness in check.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.260
And this might be our only shot

07:07.302 --> 07:09.804
to figure out this link
you and I have.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.184
You're going to need
Dimitri as well, you know.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.773
And what am I
signing up for here?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.524
That's the part
that doesn't suck.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.109
A trip into the human world.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.778
Do you realize
the kind of pre-planning

07:24.819 --> 07:26.112
that normally takes?

07:26.154 --> 07:28.740
It's a playground
for Strigoi out there.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.785
Route planning, recon,
coordination of guards.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.286
We don't have
the necessary clearances.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.455
They won't so much as open
the provincial gates for us.

07:35.497 --> 07:36.998
They will for me.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.378
This is foolhardy.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.963
Go another day, when I know
I can keep you safe.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.842
Wow, you got a real
earnest one here.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.844
Are you sure he's cool
for what we got to do?

07:49.886 --> 07:52.722
I trust him implicitly.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.307
This is what I'm doing.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.643
And your job is to make sure
I don't die doing it,

07:56.685 --> 07:58.978
so are you in,
or are you leaving me

07:59.020 --> 08:01.189
to the human world with only
Adrian to protect me?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.193
I am useless in a fight.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.905
Speaking of which, listen.

08:08.947 --> 08:12.575
You told me that I would
have my own Guardian.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.828
I know, I'm late.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.831
Well, hello, little Dhampir.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.878
This is the guy?

08:27.298 --> 08:29.592
I'm driving.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.056
I am in your hands.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.734
Have you ever even
driven a car before?

08:54.576 --> 08:56.327
Guess I'm in your hands.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.897
Most of the time.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.274
When you tried that with me,
I could feel you

09:26.316 --> 09:29.027
knocking at the door
of my consciousness.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.403
I'm envious.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.490
Says the man who can
just stroll into my dreams.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.075
About that.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.078
Now, Rose, just so you know,
when I start making

09:38.119 --> 09:40.288
inappropriate cameos
in your dreams,

09:40.330 --> 09:43.625
just know that's not
Spirit Magic, all right?

09:43.667 --> 09:45.752
That's just your
intense attraction to me.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.881
Are you a whiskey kind of lady?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.758
Where did you find this guy?

09:51.800 --> 09:52.926
So have you ever
healed anyone?

09:52.967 --> 09:57.097
He--heal? You can heal?
How?

09:57.138 --> 09:58.807
Well, it's just
like the other power.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.435
It's like this part of me
drops inward and pools,

10:02.477 --> 10:05.063
and I get this warm rush,
and I can do stuff.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.107
So maybe I should explain.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.525
Have you seen the auras yet?

10:08.566 --> 10:12.320
- Auras? No. Not yet.
- What the hell is all this?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.197
And where are we going?

10:15.824 --> 10:17.075
Time to clue us in.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.127
There is a scholar
that we think

10:27.168 --> 10:29.295
has some answers that
Lissa and I very much need.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.298
A Moroi scholar
in the human world?

10:32.340 --> 10:34.217
She's written some things
about St. Vladimir

10:34.259 --> 10:38.388
that haven't made her
very popular with the church.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.931
Or the Queen.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.599
Or anyone, really.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.227
A heretic?

10:44.269 --> 10:46.438
An iconoclast

10:46.479 --> 10:48.732
who's been accused of heresy.

I understand the fear
that St. Jude touched off,

11:39.324 --> 11:41.826
I feel it, but how much
of our souls are we willing

11:41.868 --> 11:45.288
to trade away just to feel
a little less afraid?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.707
Lady Ozera, these Dhampirs
that the others

11:47.749 --> 11:50.460
are talking about elevating
aren't just bodies.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.961
They're children,

11:52.003 --> 11:53.421
just like your nephew Christian.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.805
Abby, it's down to you.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.556
Your family has the honor

12:03.598 --> 12:04.933

xenophobic monster Tatiana

from taking the throne.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.132
Sir, are you all right?

12:42.721 --> 12:46.182
This scholar of yours,
she lives around here?

12:46.224 --> 12:47.183
Approximately.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.562
You do know
where we're going?

12:57.402 --> 12:58.903
I don't know where she lives,

12:58.945 --> 13:02.365
but I know someone who might.
- Might?

13:02.407 --> 13:06.703
She's not exactly living
out here on an official permit.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.289
You know, a heretic and all.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.415
She keeps a low profile.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.584
For fuck's sake.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.920
Do we look human now?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.834
<i>♪ Keeping you up all night ♪</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:41.131
Focus, Rose.
This is a protective nightmare.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.591
I got it,
Mr. Perimeter Control.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.843
Really?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.678
How many entry and exit points?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.555
Yeah, I don't know either.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.890
You've got 360 degree exposure
on our two charges

14:50.932 --> 14:52.809
with only two of us to cover.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.228
I'm aware, but we're good.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.980
We could be walking through
a Strigoi buffet line.

14:57.022 --> 15:00.316
I'll know
if there are Strigoi.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.535
Hi.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.334
Muscle stays out here, Ivashkov.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.544
You know that.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.670
Go. Be quick.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.839
Got it. One drink.

15:22.881 --> 15:23.965
Maybe two.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.675
No uncovered entry points.

15:25.717 --> 15:26.843
They'd better be quick.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.887
We're only here
for information.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.724
And maybe one drink.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.521
Hey, uh, Rose,
try not to get too bored

15:38.563 --> 15:40.190
without me, all right?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.117
Want to do a shot?

15:53.870 --> 15:56.289
Joking.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.876
Ish.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.506
Is it okay with you
if I let them in?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.801
Let me--let me just
get this straight.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.928
You'd marry Jesse Zeklos?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.930
Listen, that guy
makes me look eligible.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.350
Look, it's Jesse
or Ralf Dawoud,

16:15.392 --> 16:17.769
Anthony Carter,
or Wade Vogel, okay?

16:17.811 --> 16:20.146
And...

16:20.188 --> 16:21.731
it's not that
I would marry him.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.401
But they say you have to.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.320
If I want to get
my quorum back, yeah.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.446
Hoo.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.409
You know, back home,

16:32.450 --> 16:35.453
they'd look at a room
full of humans like this

16:35.495 --> 16:38.456
and see only a feedlot.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.791
You know, like cattle.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.713
But you spend some time
out here,

16:44.754 --> 16:50.343
among the humans with all
their mess and chaos and fun...

16:52.470 --> 16:54.097
Suddenly, when you turn around
and look back

16:54.139 --> 16:56.266
into our little world
with all its--

16:56.307 --> 16:59.894
all its pious rules
and sacred bloodlines--

16:59.936 --> 17:03.440
it's those Zekloses
and those Dawouds

17:03.481 --> 17:06.985
and those Carters who start
to look pretty fucking bovine.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.284
But Lissa, seriously,
you got to know.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.871
When a wise old Moroi
gives you a list like that,

17:17.912 --> 17:20.123
it's just a fact.

17:20.165 --> 17:24.961
The names they left off
are sure to be a lot more fun.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.090
Time to play.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.266
This isn't our world.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.517
No.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.811
This is fun.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.647
You're so awkward.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.191
I'm doing my job.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.985
Or maybe you don't know
what to do with yourself

17:49.027 --> 17:51.654
when you're actually
kind of free.

17:51.696 --> 17:52.822
No Moroi.

17:52.864 --> 17:53.948
No Dhampirs.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.950
None of your rules.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.411
Just the music

17:58.453 --> 18:00.830
and us.

18:00.872 --> 18:01.873
Come on.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.833
Just dance with me.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.499
Fuck.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.876
Which is it?

18:46.918 --> 18:49.504
Is it Strigoi or Lissa?

18:49.546 --> 18:52.340
I've seen this enough times,
Rose, at home, in Caroni.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.217
You feel things coming.
Which is it?

18:54.259 --> 18:56.469
Strigoi.
We have to get out of here.

18:56.511 --> 18:57.929
Lissa. Go.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.140
Go, go, go!
- Go!

19:25.415 --> 19:27.125
What the hell was that
back there?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.336
- There were Strigoi.
- I didn't see any Strigoi.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.421
They were there, trust me.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.965
What the hell
was that back there?

19:34.007 --> 19:35.342
Not the Strigoi.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.684
Took you long enough.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.521
I like it.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.278
Just tell us
where we're going.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.197
A little moonlight
boat ride, anyone?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.306
They're down there,

20:23.348 --> 20:26.309
brainstorming questions
for their heretic.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.687
It's the nerdiest
I've ever seen her.

20:31.523 --> 20:32.691
Keep warm.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.785
Do you ever think
about another life?

20:43.827 --> 20:46.329
Being more than just a pawn
they can rip from your home

20:46.371 --> 20:49.416
or throw Strigoi at for fun?

20:49.457 --> 20:52.836
A life outside the Dominion.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.047
While we were dancing,

20:56.089 --> 20:58.717
you wanted that freedom too.

21:13.356 --> 21:17.986
When I was 13, two years
into my academy training,

21:18.028 --> 21:20.572
they gave us
a Feast Day furlough.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.908
I went to see my mother,
my little sisters

21:23.950 --> 21:26.202
back on the Commune.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.538
This time, my father--

21:28.580 --> 21:30.915
or the Royal who fathered me--

21:30.957 --> 21:32.459
was visiting too.

21:35.253 --> 21:38.757
I'd met him a few times,

21:38.798 --> 21:41.343
heard him a few times

21:41.384 --> 21:44.763
on the far side of the wall,

21:44.804 --> 21:48.475
taking it out on her.

21:48.516 --> 21:52.228
Whatever a posh Moroi fucker
has to take out on anybody.

21:55.148 --> 21:59.319
I had no idea how angry I was

21:59.361 --> 22:01.279
till I found myself on him.

22:03.198 --> 22:06.284
Years of anger just...

22:06.326 --> 22:09.245
poured out of me.

22:09.287 --> 22:13.625
And when it was done,
I remember the fear,

22:13.667 --> 22:15.168
not just his.

22:17.295 --> 22:20.757
But also the fear in the eyes
of my mother,

22:20.799 --> 22:22.509
my sisters.

22:26.304 --> 22:29.349
And the fear I felt

22:29.391 --> 22:31.643
of that thing in me.

22:33.269 --> 22:37.232
It's why I need the code
of the Guardian life,

22:37.273 --> 22:39.484
to keep that thing in check.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.321
Freedom.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.410
Freedom scares me
to death, Rose.

22:50.995 --> 22:54.082
Or it did until--

22:54.124 --> 22:55.875
Until now?

23:41.838 --> 23:43.673
Where the hell are we?

23:53.016 --> 23:55.185
You've had a line
on this woman for a while now.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.020
How have you never come to
ask these questions before?

23:59.731 --> 24:01.608
Sometimes you need
the right answers to be able

24:01.649 --> 24:03.318
to ask the right questions.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.637
Clarice Sewani.
I'm Adrian--

24:30.679 --> 24:32.430
I know who you are,
and the answer

24:32.472 --> 24:33.682
is the same as it's been
for everyone

24:33.723 --> 24:36.309
you've sent to hassle me:
fuck off.

24:36.351 --> 24:39.104
Adrian, what are you doing?

24:39.145 --> 24:41.481
What do you think,
Lord Ivashkov?

24:41.523 --> 24:42.565
Just gonna force your way in?

24:42.607 --> 24:43.733
Adrian...

24:43.775 --> 24:45.527
Gonna set your Guardians
on me?

24:45.568 --> 24:47.237
You think you can make me talk?

24:47.278 --> 24:49.906
No.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.741
She can.

24:55.245 --> 24:58.206
She's not gonna give us
what we need if you don't.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.338
I will.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.591
You have Compulsion.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.176
You're a Messenger.

25:12.262 --> 25:15.140
Which means
I can make you talk,

25:15.181 --> 25:16.683
if I choose to.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.795
Are you okay?

25:45.837 --> 25:49.257
I should be asking you.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.633
I'm fine.

25:55.013 --> 25:55.972
Here.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.355
You're pushing yourself.

26:03.396 --> 26:06.274
I'm just--I'm just tired.

26:06.316 --> 26:07.609
But I did it.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.445
I will be king.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.323
I--

26:18.953 --> 26:24.000
I just--I just need to make it
through this last night.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.378
The Queen will
submit me to caucus,

26:26.419 --> 26:28.004
the votes will formalize it,

26:28.046 --> 26:29.798
and then you and I
can both rest.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.299
But you have to make it
through tonight

26:31.341 --> 26:36.596
looking like a king,
and you can barely stand.

26:36.638 --> 26:41.017
Do you really think they'll
allow it if they see this?

26:41.059 --> 26:45.146
Dad, would the Unionists
even support you?

26:45.188 --> 26:48.566
I believe in you.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.902
And I'm better. Look at me.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.446
I slept. I had a feed.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.615
I'm gonna heal you again.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.992
I am. I can handle it.

26:58.034 --> 27:01.454
And after last night,

27:01.496 --> 27:04.958
there isn't much in my life
that's come to anything.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.920
But this, I can do.

27:11.881 --> 27:14.175
I can make you king.

27:29.566 --> 27:31.443
Ready?

27:41.036 --> 27:43.038
A man who raises
such daughters

27:43.079 --> 27:44.873
seeks to be the father
to our people.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.833
It cannot be.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.711
Your Holiness,
it's time you stopped Victor

27:49.753 --> 27:51.755
once and for all.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.173
Me?

27:56.134 --> 27:59.679
I represent
the Elemental Way, my dear.

27:59.721 --> 28:00.972
Not the mortal one.

28:01.014 --> 28:03.808
That distinction
is exactly the problem.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.518
The Strigoi are at the gates.

28:05.560 --> 28:09.898
Our numbers are dwindling,
and we are dithering.

28:12.442 --> 28:15.278
We need to think bigger.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.573
You, my dear aunt,

28:18.615 --> 28:22.035
need to think bigger.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.996
You will speak for the Church

28:25.038 --> 28:27.749
and end this humiliation.

28:44.808 --> 28:47.894
Okay.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.312
I think I need to know
what's happening here.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.776
What do you want to know?

28:54.818 --> 28:56.486
All of it.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.363
And then this corner
looked like

28:58.405 --> 29:00.365
it was Vladimir
healing someone,

29:00.407 --> 29:01.741
which is also something
I can do.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.911
That leaves the center,
where Vladimir's eyes are.

29:04.953 --> 29:06.830
Where he's consumed
by Darkness.

29:06.871 --> 29:11.418
His eyes are black in a way
I think I've seen in myself.

29:11.459 --> 29:15.255
He was a Spirit User,
and it did something to him.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.965
And a long time ago,
someone decided

29:17.007 --> 29:18.508
that no one should ever know.

29:18.550 --> 29:21.302
And they gave us some bullshit
story about happy Vladimir.

29:21.344 --> 29:24.222
We want the truth about Vlad.

29:24.264 --> 29:25.348
All of it.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.808
We want to know
how he fought it off,

29:26.850 --> 29:28.435
the Darkness.

29:28.476 --> 29:29.978
He must have, somehow.

29:38.236 --> 29:41.823
Compulsion,.
Dream Walking. Healing.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.117
That's Anna there.

29:44.159 --> 29:48.747
Faithful Anna,
the model Dhampir Guardian.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.415
Shadow-Kissed Anna.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.044
But what about
the fourth corner?

29:56.796 --> 29:59.007
It's been worn away.

29:59.049 --> 30:01.968
I've never been able
to find that out.

30:02.010 --> 30:05.805
If early accounts of this
altarpiece are to be believed,

30:05.847 --> 30:10.060
the image here originally
looked something like this.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.899
It's called a Spirit Bond.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.859
Anna knew his heart
like it was her own.

30:17.901 --> 30:20.278
Sometimes his thoughts.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.198
Maybe even saw
through his eyes.

30:23.239 --> 30:26.534
This is your answer.

30:26.576 --> 30:30.955
Vladimir's solution to the
Darkness, as you call it.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.710
He passed it to her.

30:47.931 --> 30:50.392
They actually
believe all of this.

30:50.433 --> 30:51.851
A Fifth Element?

30:51.893 --> 30:54.479
Secret Magic that Vladimir had
and the entire Dominion

30:54.521 --> 30:56.106
has kept a secret
for centuries?

30:56.147 --> 30:58.441
Or they just edited it out
of the whole story

30:58.483 --> 31:01.361
after they burned
a bunch of people alive.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.572
That's what they do--
lie and kill.

31:04.614 --> 31:05.615
So why not?

31:05.657 --> 31:07.701
Because... it goes against

31:07.742 --> 31:09.911
the whole holy Elemental Order.

31:09.953 --> 31:13.123
The four-part harmony
of the world.

31:13.164 --> 31:16.376
I shouldn't have
let this happen.

31:16.418 --> 31:19.170
Fuck.

31:19.212 --> 31:21.423
They're coming.

31:21.464 --> 31:22.966
Go.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.972
Vladimir didn't
beat the Darkness.

31:29.014 --> 31:30.390
He just gave it
to someone else.

31:30.432 --> 31:33.727
Have I been doing this to Rose?

31:33.768 --> 31:35.770
She does sort of walk
on the Dark side of things.

31:35.812 --> 31:37.272
No, no.

31:37.313 --> 31:40.984
He was supposed to show me
I could be someone good.

31:41.026 --> 31:43.820
When everything's telling me
that what I have in me is bad,

31:43.862 --> 31:45.780
he was supposed to be good.

31:45.822 --> 31:49.200
But he's just another parasitic
Moroi like all of us,

31:49.242 --> 31:51.119
just using his
Guardian like that.

31:51.161 --> 31:53.538
Strigoi coming.
We're going now.

31:53.580 --> 31:56.207
What?

31:56.249 --> 31:58.251
You children.

31:58.293 --> 31:59.711
You led them right to me.

31:59.753 --> 32:01.546
Yeah, lady, we did,
but we've got the jump on them,

32:01.588 --> 32:03.089
and we're going
with or without you.

32:03.131 --> 32:05.592
- Rose, no, she has--
- Lissa, we've got to go.

32:07.844 --> 32:09.054
They're here.

32:20.482 --> 32:22.692
Inside.

32:22.734 --> 32:24.194
You'll be safe in here.

32:32.285 --> 32:33.828
You knew they were coming.

32:33.870 --> 32:36.998
You can sense them in your gut.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.425
Hey.

33:28.466 --> 33:31.261
Hey, listen,
you're assuming that Vladimir

33:31.302 --> 33:33.304
forced his Darkness onto Anna,

33:33.346 --> 33:36.266
but what if she took it?

33:36.307 --> 33:37.684
Isn't that what we learned
in Sunday school,

33:37.726 --> 33:41.730
the holy devotion
of Shadow-Kissed Anna?

33:41.771 --> 33:44.441
What is Shadow-Kissed?

33:44.482 --> 33:47.068
I mean, how does any of this
even makes sense?

34:00.749 --> 34:02.667
This is one of the parts
of Vladimir's story

34:02.709 --> 34:05.837
the authorities
wanted to expunge

34:05.879 --> 34:09.966
because the Spirit Bond

34:10.008 --> 34:12.844
was the fruit of Vladimir's
ultimate sin.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.229
Rose! Rose!

34:31.821 --> 34:34.115
Rose!

34:34.157 --> 34:35.700
Lissa!

34:43.750 --> 34:45.669
She's just a kid.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.755
What the actual fuck?

35:09.776 --> 35:11.695
Never hesitate.

35:36.219 --> 35:40.348
<i>* ♪</i>

35:46.271 --> 35:49.566
May the succession bring
prosperity to the Dominion.

35:52.485 --> 35:53.695
Very good.

35:53.737 --> 35:55.780
Thank you all.

36:03.204 --> 36:06.166
Is there something else, Irene?

36:06.207 --> 36:07.500
There is.

36:13.631 --> 36:15.383
Your Majesty...

36:20.055 --> 36:23.350
For decades now, you and I

36:23.391 --> 36:27.604
have maintained a balance
between the vagaries

36:27.645 --> 36:32.484
of the political realm and the
durable interest of the faith.

36:32.525 --> 36:35.779
As have all eight
of my High Priests

36:35.820 --> 36:38.031
and Priestesses before you.

36:38.073 --> 36:40.408
Yours? Hmm.

36:40.450 --> 36:43.286
That, Marina,
is precisely the problem.

36:43.328 --> 36:45.121
The balance has collapsed.

36:45.163 --> 36:47.874
This ugly chapter
with Victor is only

36:47.916 --> 36:50.460
the latest indignity
to be forced on the faith

36:50.502 --> 36:52.796
by political interests.

36:52.837 --> 36:56.466
The time has come for the
faith to assert itself.

36:56.508 --> 36:59.386
To muck about where
it doesn't belong, you mean?

36:59.427 --> 37:01.304
To call in
the many chits we have

37:01.346 --> 37:04.766
piled up against the crown.

37:04.808 --> 37:08.728
Do not mistake
forbearance for weakness.

37:08.770 --> 37:11.314
I am telling you that
nominating Victor

37:11.356 --> 37:14.025
would be a very grave error.

37:14.067 --> 37:16.361
Better your niece.

37:16.403 --> 37:19.739
How much balance would there be

37:19.781 --> 37:24.786
if one family controlled
both Church and state?

37:24.828 --> 37:26.955
Unless you're retiring.

37:26.996 --> 37:29.958
Tatiana is the only candidate
for the throne

37:30.000 --> 37:32.419
that the Church will tolerate.

37:32.460 --> 37:35.797
And without the support
of the Church,

37:35.839 --> 37:37.173
the new monarch will fail.

37:37.215 --> 37:39.926
The Elementalists
will make sure of it.

37:39.968 --> 37:41.761
<i>I</i> will make sure of it.

37:41.803 --> 37:45.765
Victor will not rule.

38:09.789 --> 38:11.624
I saw him.

38:11.666 --> 38:13.460
They followed us here
from the club.

38:13.501 --> 38:15.128
They had a human
smorgasbord there.

38:15.170 --> 38:17.255
What would we matter to them?

38:32.354 --> 38:34.147
My life here is dead.

38:34.189 --> 38:35.982
No, the Strigoi are dead.

38:36.024 --> 38:37.484
You could clean up, and--

38:37.525 --> 38:40.487
You're so far out
of your depth.

38:40.528 --> 38:44.908
You have no idea
how this world works.

38:44.949 --> 38:48.286
It's not the Strigoi
I'm worried about.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.662
It's the ones
who come after them.

38:56.503 --> 39:01.007
You've burned my world down.

39:01.049 --> 39:04.886
But to make us even,
I'm going to give you

39:04.928 --> 39:06.721
what you came here for.

39:30.245 --> 39:31.579
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

39:31.621 --> 39:33.665
How can you have possibly
lost the Queen?

39:33.707 --> 39:35.125
What are you
talking about, Abby?

39:35.166 --> 39:38.211
The Queen has assured me--

39:38.253 --> 39:41.047
I have it
from Tatiana's own lips.

39:41.089 --> 39:43.550
The Queen won't submit
your name to the Council.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.385
Word's already getting out.

39:45.427 --> 39:47.012
You've lost her confidence.

39:47.053 --> 39:51.808
Tarus, the Ozeras,
they're all wavering.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.893
You may not have your votes
much longer.

39:59.274 --> 40:01.359
No.

40:01.401 --> 40:03.403
Not now.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.115
No.

40:16.124 --> 40:18.460
Your father sent me.

40:23.173 --> 40:24.299
Are you all right?

40:24.341 --> 40:25.342
I just need to feed.

40:25.383 --> 40:27.469
Of course.

40:48.865 --> 40:50.867
Sonya.

40:50.909 --> 40:53.703
Hey, easy.

40:53.745 --> 40:54.954
Sonya.

40:56.873 --> 40:58.208
Slow down, please!

41:00.085 --> 41:03.630
Please! No!

41:07.050 --> 41:09.886
This is the moment.
I have the votes.

41:09.928 --> 41:11.346
You only need to name me,
and it's done.

41:11.388 --> 41:12.889
They will do your will.

41:12.931 --> 41:15.475
Marina, please,
after all we've given,

41:15.517 --> 41:18.603
I have to have this.

41:18.645 --> 41:21.064
I'm sorry, Victor.

41:21.106 --> 41:23.066
The Church has forced my hand.

41:28.530 --> 41:33.159
But I have
one final card to play.

41:45.880 --> 41:48.842
I want to thank
my dear friend Abby Batista

41:48.883 --> 41:52.595
for hosting us
on this weighty day.

41:52.637 --> 41:54.764
As we choose our next leader,

41:54.806 --> 41:59.853
I remind you that a good
monarch must know when to rule

41:59.894 --> 42:01.479
and when not to.

42:01.521 --> 42:04.607
As there is no clear majority
for either the Elementalist

42:04.649 --> 42:06.818
or Unionist candidate tonight,

42:06.860 --> 42:09.571
I am suspending this caucus...

42:12.032 --> 42:16.578
And invoking the ancient rite
of Royal Trial,

42:16.619 --> 42:19.831
a ritual steeped in
and sanctified

42:19.873 --> 42:22.751
by our religious forebears.

42:22.792 --> 42:26.629
The candidates must face
a series of sacred tests.

42:26.671 --> 42:30.759
Whoever wins will rule.

42:30.800 --> 42:34.596
Thus, the Elements
will decide our fate,

42:34.637 --> 42:37.724
not your aging Queen.

42:37.766 --> 42:41.936
As of now,
the future of our Dominion

42:41.978 --> 42:44.647
is in the hands
of the Elements.

43:08.838 --> 43:11.424
It was just a moment.

43:11.466 --> 43:14.886
We hesitated
for one tiny moment.

43:14.928 --> 43:18.765
There's no room for divided
loyalties in this world, Rose.

43:18.807 --> 43:21.434
There can never be a question

43:21.476 --> 43:24.312
of you or them,

43:24.354 --> 43:26.606
me or your charge.

43:26.648 --> 43:27.941
There can be no hesitation.

43:27.982 --> 43:31.277
Of course not.

43:31.319 --> 43:32.821
It's a fucking dream.

43:38.159 --> 43:41.121
But you felt it.

43:41.162 --> 43:42.455
Right?

43:46.001 --> 43:47.919
What we could be?

43:50.171 --> 43:52.966
Every second of it.

43:53.008 --> 43:54.467
But never again.

44:32.881 --> 44:36.426
<i>For 500 years, we've
burrowed down in our provinces</i>

44:36.468 --> 44:39.137
<i>and let ourselves forget
that the Strigoi</i>

44:39.179 --> 44:42.599
<i>aren't the only ones
with the power to do us harm.</i>

44:44.225 --> 44:48.438
<i>Beyond the wards,
they watch and wait,</i>

44:48.480 --> 44:53.651
<i>ready to come down on us
with all their fury if we err.</i>

44:53.693 --> 44:55.612
<i>But if history is our guide,</i>

44:55.653 --> 44:59.657
<i>the first wound we suffer
will be self-inflicted.</i>

44:59.699 --> 45:03.036
<i>We turn on our own first.</i>

45:52.210 --> 45:54.379
Thank God you're here.
I needed to see you.

45:54.421 --> 45:57.007
I don't want you
to be my Guardian.

45:57.048 --> 45:59.718
Not now, not ever.

45:59.759 --> 46:03.138
It's just--it's too wrong,
all of it.

46:03.179 --> 46:05.640
The way we exploit you.

46:05.682 --> 46:08.601
I just can't do it anymore,
not to you.

46:10.020 --> 46:14.107
They'll give me someone,
and I can't avoid that.

46:16.776 --> 46:20.238
But I just can't
have it be you.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.407
You deserve better.

46:22.449 --> 46:23.616
I deserve?

46:23.658 --> 46:25.994
I'm trying to do what's best.

46:28.204 --> 46:32.250
You have no idea
what it's like to be us.

46:32.292 --> 46:33.626
None.

46:33.668 --> 46:36.755
And now you're gonna tell me
what I deserve?

46:36.796 --> 46:39.257
You're going to make
that choice for me,

46:39.299 --> 46:40.675
but I don't get a say?

46:43.178 --> 46:47.974
I have no option
but to be a Guardian,

46:48.016 --> 46:52.020
and the only thing that makes
all that shit worthwhile

46:52.062 --> 46:53.688
is you.

46:53.730 --> 46:55.774
And now you're gonna
take that away

46:55.815 --> 46:58.818
as some kind of a favor to me?

46:58.860 --> 47:01.154
You have no idea
what I would give up for you.

47:01.196 --> 47:02.489
I would die for you.

47:02.530 --> 47:04.616
Yeah, I know you would,
because you did.

47:06.826 --> 47:10.330
The ultimate sin
Vladimir committed

47:10.372 --> 47:12.165
was resurrection.

47:14.626 --> 47:18.546
In a faith built
on the cycling of Elements,

47:18.588 --> 47:21.091
<i>there is no
greater violation...</i>

47:24.511 --> 47:28.807
Than bringing life
back to the dead.

47:28.848 --> 47:32.352
<i>That was the source
of the bond to Anna,</i>

47:32.394 --> 47:35.063
<i>the Shadow Kiss.</i>

47:35.105 --> 47:39.317
<i>Death left its mark on her...</i>

47:40.819 --> 47:44.531
<i>Just as it has
on your friend.</i>

47:46.991 --> 47:48.493
You died

47:48.535 --> 47:52.163
saving me in the accident.

47:52.205 --> 47:53.665
I brought you back.

47:56.209 --> 47:59.170
You're Shadow-Kissed.

47:59.212 --> 48:02.173
That's why we have this bond
between our spirits.

48:02.215 --> 48:04.092
But now--

48:04.134 --> 48:08.596
now I know how toxic
that's been for you.

48:08.638 --> 48:12.559
I've been passing
my Darkness off to you.

48:13.977 --> 48:16.521
I'm not gonna do it anymore,

48:16.563 --> 48:17.856
not if I can help it.

48:17.897 --> 48:20.775
So firing me
is going to solve that?

48:20.817 --> 48:22.444
It's a start.

48:22.485 --> 48:25.697
- Lissa--
- I'm sorry.

48:25.739 --> 48:27.532
I'm so sorry.

48:34.914 --> 48:37.208
Lissa.

48:37.250 --> 48:38.376
Lissa!

48:40.003 --> 48:41.296
Lissa!

48:44.174 --> 48:45.383
Lissa!

48:51.139 --> 48:53.391
Lissa!

49:19.125 --> 49:20.126
Sonya?

49:21.294 --> 49:22.629
Sonya.

49:36.476 --> 49:37.644
Sonya?
