- Weirdly helpful for someone

04:07.789 --> 04:10.166
who unceremoniously dumped me
on the dance floor.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.584

04:11.626 --> 04:15.380
- And I have mine
for not wanting his help,

04:15.422 --> 04:17.215
even if I need it.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.758
This whole thing's
in Old Moroi,

04:18.800 --> 04:21.386
so if something here explains
what's going on with me,

04:21.428 --> 04:22.512
I won't be able to read it.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.431
- I can help translate.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.765
I'm sure I can make time,

04:25.807 --> 04:27.726
even with my upcoming
Benchmark Tests.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.938
- Rose, focus on your tests.
I'll be fine.

You'd be surprised
how much free time I have,

Now I'm back to plan A--

04:54.711 --> 04:55.962
this stuff out first,

'cause when we get

05:22.489 --> 05:25.408
- I didn't grow up
here at court,

05:25.450 --> 05:28.995
and as I formally declare
my candidacy,

05:29.037 --> 05:30.372
I see you're surprised.

05:30.413 --> 05:34.084
But it's really Lissa Dragomir

05:34.125 --> 05:36.127
you have to thank.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.339
I'm young and new here,

05:39.381 --> 05:42.842
and so I may seem
like a radical choice.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.513
But with a Dhampir best friend

05:46.554 --> 05:50.517
and her association
with the Ozera family,

05:50.558 --> 05:54.354
she was the radical.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.524
Untethered from our traditions.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.402
After learning
much from my Aunt Irene,

06:00.443 --> 06:03.738
I believe
in the Elementalist cause.

06:03.780 --> 06:08.535
My platform will put faith
and Moroi needs first.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.537
- Moroi don't live in a vacuum.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.956
- The Queen backed her horse,

06:12.997 --> 06:15.417
and it stumbled
out to the gate.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.378
She waits
for the Council to speak.

06:18.420 --> 06:22.799
When you do,
I hope you speak my name.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.759
Thank you.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.971
- Thank you, Tatiana.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.140
We will take
all of this to heart.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.356

back in your mouth, Peter.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.816

06:39.858 --> 06:42.068
There's still time
for other candidates to emerge.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.195
- This council has serious
business to attend to.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.657
We can't rely solely
on long-term repopulation

06:47.699 --> 06:51.077
to solve
our Guardian shortage issue.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.871
We need
a more immediate approach.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.414
- I can think
of one deceased monk

06:54.456 --> 06:57.417
who might object to another
of your aggressive approaches.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.794
- Let's keep things civil,
Victor.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.422
- I propose we lower the age
of Guardian enlistment

07:02.464 --> 07:06.009
down to 16, thereby expanding
our pool of eligible Dhampirs.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.344
- 16?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.220
You'd make cannon fodder
out of children?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.764
- 16 is not a child.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.808
If they're properly trained,
they're fit to serve.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.477
Isn't that the whole point?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.020
- How old is your youngest,
Marie?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.939
And yours, Dane?
- Desperate times, Victor.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.192

07:56.810 --> 07:58.353
- No initiative from up top.

After the St. Jude's massacre,
we have to test every Novice,

08:01.523 --> 08:02.732
even underclassmen.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.734
- Those poor kids
don't stand a chance.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.115

08:10.156 --> 08:11.574
For the next 24 hours,

08:11.616 --> 08:13.702
your usual Guardians
will be replaced

08:13.743 --> 08:15.537

you see before you.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.583
Novices, the Benchmark Tests
are your chance to show us

08:20.625 --> 08:21.835
what you're made of.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.878
You will be scored

Guardians will act as Strigoi.

Everyone will be outfitted
with these special collars

08:35.432 --> 08:36.891

08:36.933 --> 08:39.602
If you or your charge's squib
gets popped,

08:39.644 --> 08:41.688
you're dead.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.691
But if you stay alive

08:44.733 --> 08:46.818
and rack up enough points,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.029
you'll get to attend
the Royal Tour

08:49.070 --> 08:51.156
as part of
the Guardian security team.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.753
- Difficult,
but not impossible.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.505
- And I'm fueled
by the unflinching expectations

09:07.547 --> 09:10.050

Lissa and I will try to leave

We can't have a government

No bloodline quorum

That's the same as you.

39:55.186 --> 39:56.730
- Yeah.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.106
This stuff is
kind of everywhere,

39:58.148 --> 40:00.108
if you know
what you're looking for.

40:00.150 --> 40:01.901
- [sighs]
This feels dangerous.

40:01.943 --> 40:05.155
- But if it is real
and I have this new magic

40:05.196 --> 40:06.656
and I can gain
a seat at the table

40:06.698 --> 40:08.033
where decisions
are being made--

40:08.074 --> 40:09.242
- Yeah, but how?

40:09.284 --> 40:10.952
Using Compulsion
on the Council?

40:10.994 --> 40:13.329
- No, never.

40:13.371 --> 40:17.751
I'm just saying maybe
I'm not powerless anymore,

40:17.792 --> 40:19.461
in more ways than one.

40:19.502 --> 40:21.504
If even a part of this is real,

40:21.546 --> 40:23.214
maybe Compulsion
is just the start

40:23.256 --> 40:26.092
of what Spirit Users can do.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.011
In these stories,

40:28.053 --> 40:30.847
<i>there's even Spirit Users</i>
<i>who can see auras.</i>

40:30.889 --> 40:34.768

[bird twittering]

40:48.740 --> 40:51.910
<i>- Yeah, there's a darkness</i>
<i>that comes with Spirit,</i>

40:51.951 --> 40:55.246
<i>because that kind of power</i>
<i>always comes with a price.</i>

40:55.288 --> 40:57.832
Still, I don't know
how much of this is true.

40:57.874 --> 41:00.835
Can't do half of these things,
but...

41:00.877 --> 41:03.546
if it is true,

41:03.588 --> 41:05.840
can you imagine
all the people I could help?

41:05.882 --> 41:08.968
- I can imagine.

41:09.010 --> 41:12.222
<i>- * Ooh *</i>

41:12.263 --> 41:14.015
<i>* Ooh *</i>

41:14.057 --> 41:15.767

41:15.809 --> 41:18.353
<i>* Ooh *</i>

41:18.395 --> 41:23.358
<i>* Keep it all</i>
<i>behind these eyes *</i>

41:23.400 --> 41:25.610
- I think
you should get some sleep.

41:30.323 --> 41:31.991
- Sure.

41:36.371 --> 41:38.540
[door clicks open and shut]

41:46.131 --> 41:47.549
- Victor?

41:51.886 --> 41:54.180
I thought you'd be
at the Council meeting.

41:54.222 --> 41:55.765
- I'd rather be with you.

42:01.229 --> 42:05.066
<i>[somber music]</i>

42:05.108 --> 42:07.861

42:07.902 --> 42:12.782
<i>* *</i>

42:12.824 --> 42:15.827
- [breathing deeply]

42:15.869 --> 42:22.792
<i>* *</i>

42:40.518 --> 42:43.188
- I hate
that I wasn't there to help.

42:43.229 --> 42:44.814
[both grunting]

42:47.108 --> 42:49.444
- You don't think you helped?

42:49.486 --> 42:50.737
Because of you,

42:50.779 --> 42:53.198
Christian and Mason
survived the night.

42:53.239 --> 43:00.622
<i>* *</i>

43:01.748 --> 43:05.251
- All I did was tell you that
my friends were in trouble.

43:05.293 --> 43:06.836
I didn't fight.

43:06.878 --> 43:08.129
I just sat here,

43:08.171 --> 43:10.632
while you and the other
Guardians saved them.

43:12.884 --> 43:15.512
Mason said
that I didn't come after him

43:15.553 --> 43:17.222
to protect my ranking.

43:17.263 --> 43:20.225
- He's wrong.

43:20.266 --> 43:23.269
What you did was far harder
than fighting tonight,

43:23.311 --> 43:25.313
at least for you.

43:25.355 --> 43:26.981
You're number one
because you obeyed

43:27.023 --> 43:28.983
the chain of command.

43:29.025 --> 43:31.027
You did your duty.

43:31.069 --> 43:33.238
- Well, it sucked.

43:33.279 --> 43:35.448
- Maybe.

43:35.490 --> 43:38.827
But tonight, Roza,
you were brave.

43:38.868 --> 43:40.328
- Roza?

43:40.370 --> 43:42.539
- Sorry.

43:42.580 --> 43:46.251
Every now and then,
my Russian childhood comes out.

43:46.292 --> 43:52.215

43:52.257 --> 43:53.466
- I like it.

43:53.508 --> 43:55.802

43:55.844 --> 44:00.181
- You also live
to fight another day,

44:00.223 --> 44:03.977
which brings us
to another important rule--

44:04.019 --> 44:08.481
always be ready,
'cause today is a new day,

44:08.523 --> 44:10.775
and the Benchmarks continue.

44:13.153 --> 44:17.115
[whispering] Good luck, Roza.

44:21.202 --> 44:23.329
- Forgive the late hour,

44:23.371 --> 44:25.457
but a way forward
has been suggested.

44:25.498 --> 44:27.500
- Has it?

44:27.542 --> 44:28.835
- Victor was right

44:28.877 --> 44:31.838
when he said the only way
to test a Novice's acumen

44:31.880 --> 44:34.799
is by confronting them
with a real Strigoi.

44:34.841 --> 44:38.595
It would appear
we now have one available

44:38.636 --> 44:41.097
and the votes
to make it happen.
