WEBVTT

00:14.055 --> 00:18.018
<i>- We all know the dangers
that lurk outside our gates.</i>

00:19.644 --> 00:22.564
<i>But under the protection
of our Dhampir Guardians,</i>

00:22.605 --> 00:24.482
<i>we are safe.</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:30.071
<i>The future of the Dragomir
family is in your hands.</i>

00:30.113 --> 00:31.656
Lissa, as your godfather,

00:31.698 --> 00:34.200
I promised your family I would
always look out for you.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.869
<i>Spirit use is real.</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:37.037
This feels dangerous.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.204
Maybe compulsion
is just the start

00:38.246 --> 00:39.664
of what Spirit Users can do.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.000
<i>Rose is one of our best
Guardian Novices,</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:43.251
but she's a handful.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.753
Will you teach me?

00:48.631 --> 00:50.508
<i>Rose saw through my eyes.</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:52.260
I feel like you've always been
pretty tuned into me.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.055
But this feels different somehow.

00:55.096 --> 00:59.225
Novices, the benchmark tests
are simulated surprise attacks.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.353
A way forward
has been suggested.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.813
<i>The only way
to test a Novice's acumen</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:05.899
<i>is by confronting them
with a real Strigoi.</i>

01:07.275 --> 01:09.694
- It's too dangerous.
- Always be ready.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.078
- Move it, Novice.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.294
Congratulations.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.464
You five represent the Novices
who exemplify the acumen

01:29.506 --> 01:31.591
fit for our Guardian ranks.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.094
Your objective is
to escort a Moroi Royal

01:34.135 --> 01:35.762
to a predetermined location

01:35.804 --> 01:38.306
and secure it by sundown.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.933
You will then keep
your charge alive

01:39.974 --> 01:41.267
by any means.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.603
At nightfall, Bravo Team
will enter the field

01:43.645 --> 01:44.938
and come for you
and your charge.

01:44.979 --> 01:49.693
If your patch is popped
by Bravo Team, you fail.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.738
If your Royal's patch
is popped, you all fail.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.199
If you survive Bravo Team's
onslaught tonight,

01:56.241 --> 01:57.909
we'll see you
on the Royal Tour.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.121
In lieu of having
an actual Moroi in the field,

02:01.162 --> 02:03.206
one of you will be assigned
the role.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.291
Rose, since you're
atop the rankings,

02:05.333 --> 02:06.668
I'm making you team leader

02:06.710 --> 02:08.128
and leaving the decision
to you.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.630
Team leader? Me?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.132
But what about--
- Decision's made.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.591
Putting Rose in charge
of protecting

02:13.633 --> 02:16.177
anyone not named Lissa
isn't gonna end well.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.762
Maybe you should just
flunk us all now.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.642
Heavy is the head, Hathaway.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.561
You want to be
Vasilissa's guardian?

02:24.602 --> 02:26.312
Leading your team to victory
is a hell of a way

02:26.354 --> 02:28.481
to make your case.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.316
Everything you need
is in these rucksacks.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.610
Get changed and get going.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.404
Good luck.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.032
Novices, pa-shon!

02:50.086 --> 02:51.880
Well, that's a great start.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.549
I'm good.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.260
Probably could have done
without that fifth pint.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.763
Yeah, no shit.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.598
Here.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.224
Hydrate.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.274
Looks like we're heading
to a structure

03:11.316 --> 03:13.234
a few hours away.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.237
Herk, you're with me
on near guard.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.822
And Dean, you're on far rear.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.408
Meredith, navigate
and take far front.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.160
I knew I shouldn't
have come back early.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.747
And Eddie, you're our Moroi.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.248
Why me?

03:27.290 --> 03:30.001
Last I checked, I'm higher
in the rankings than they are.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.252
You're also the youngest,

03:31.294 --> 03:32.587
with the least amount
of field training.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.798
Now, we've got a lot
of ground to cover

03:34.839 --> 03:37.425
and not enough daylight
to do it in.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.553
So get dressed
and let's get going.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.709
Come on!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.585
Out with you.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.422
All right, let him go.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.882
Come on!

04:17.924 --> 04:18.967
Come on!

04:24.264 --> 04:25.890
Move it.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.905
You're one ugly bastard,
aren't you?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.661
It's like a drug, isn't it?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.538
- Andre.
- The search for answers.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.790
You're not real.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.500
You're just part
of the Darkness.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.251
You can't run from me,
you know.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.503
Stop it.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.630
The Darkness will
always find you

05:38.672 --> 05:41.883
and twist away at your insides
until you remember!

05:41.925 --> 05:43.551
Leave me alone!

05:51.393 --> 05:52.977
<i>Sandovsky's Syndrome?</i>

05:53.019 --> 05:54.813
That's terminal.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.440
This is a fucking joke, right?

06:06.324 --> 06:09.119
Can you please say something?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.371
How long do we have?

06:11.413 --> 06:13.581
Not long enough.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.043
- Dad--
- Absolutely not.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.211
I can heal him.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.629
Heal, not cure.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.381
The toll it would take
would be too great.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.008
You know that.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.385
Sonya, if anything like that
were to happen again--

06:29.264 --> 06:33.018
Apologies for interrupting
at such an hour, Victor, but...

06:33.059 --> 06:36.021
I'm afraid I made
a terrible mistake.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.400
<i>What you've done
is unconscionable!</i>

06:40.442 --> 06:41.735
Reprehensible!

06:41.776 --> 06:44.237
It is not who we are
or what we stand for!

06:44.279 --> 06:46.614
- Here, here.
- What we stand for, Victor,

06:46.656 --> 06:48.241
is the well-being of the Moroi.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.659
To what end?

06:49.701 --> 06:51.578
Destroying the relationship
between the Council

06:51.619 --> 06:53.705
and the Dhampir community?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.749
We have an obligation
to everyone,

06:55.790 --> 06:57.751
not just the Moroi.
- Yes.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.711
We have never,
ever willingly put

06:59.753 --> 07:01.087
innocent lives in jeopardy.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.630
And with our numbers
so low already--

07:02.672 --> 07:04.632
They are not innocent.
They are Dhampirs.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.885
Their mere existence puts
their life in jeopardy.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.096
And we must demand
both quality and quantity

07:10.138 --> 07:12.974
if we are to breed a more
capable line of Guardians.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.309
Yes.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.810
If your position is that

07:15.852 --> 07:17.771
our top Novices
are so ill-prepared

07:17.812 --> 07:21.775
they can't defend themselves
from a single Strigoi,

07:21.816 --> 07:24.986
then you are only further
making our case for us.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.114
My God,
you're a fucking monster.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.826
Now, I understand your fears
after the losses at St. Jude's,

07:31.868 --> 07:33.828
but I promise you,
if this council is unwilling

07:33.870 --> 07:34.871
to see reason, I will--

07:34.913 --> 07:36.039
I'd be extremely careful

07:36.081 --> 07:39.084
what you say or do next, Victor.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.503
The Queen is aware
of the situation.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.254
To act against
the will of the Council

07:43.296 --> 07:45.048
is to act against her will

07:45.090 --> 07:48.051
and would thus
be considered treason.

07:50.345 --> 07:54.015
The Queen may be aware of this,
but she can't be for it.

07:54.057 --> 07:58.269
I propose an emergency motion
to rescind the vote.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.356
Not without a 2/3 majority,
as I'm sure you are aware.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.942
Tatiana,
please don't speak to me

08:03.983 --> 08:07.153
as if I haven't been doing this
long before your fangs dropped.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.281
Now, if you don't mind,
the adults are talking.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.825
Fine.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.743
All in favor
of Victor's motion?

08:24.379 --> 08:26.047
All opposed?

08:29.175 --> 08:30.969
The nays have it.

08:38.268 --> 08:42.647
Rose.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.149
Rose, I'm tired.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.400
We can't stop.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.694
But I'm so hungry.

08:54.909 --> 08:59.456
I won't be caught dead
eating food so pedestrian.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.874
I demand my feeder.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.834
Do you know who my father is?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.210
Know your place, Guardian.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.879
Eddie, I swear.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.715
Just eat it and shut up
before I kick your teeth in.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.845
Still not quite sure
I get what Mason sees in you.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.056
You really must not
want your teeth.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.267
I'm just saying,
you're rough around the edges

09:19.309 --> 09:21.394
and a bit prickly.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.897
But Mason seems to worship you.

09:23.938 --> 09:27.025
I never asked anyone
to worship me.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.653
You don't know how love works,
do you?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.365
Mason's not in love with me.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.657
The hell he's not.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.534
Mind your own.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.746
He's just
a really good guy, Rose.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.332
So fly that kite straight
or cut him loose,

09:42.374 --> 09:43.958
'cause you've got him
twisted in knots.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.628
Appreciate
the unsolicited advice,

09:46.670 --> 09:49.923
but that's
a really bad metaphor.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.601
Hey, Meredith?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.769
There are wards set up

10:02.811 --> 10:04.396
around the training areas, right?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.731
Yeah. Why?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.568
Nothing.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.612
Let's keep going.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.754
Sorry to hear about this.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.133
Your dad is one
of the good ones, you know.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.718
Sorry.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.637
You have to work,
and I'm sitting here

10:37.679 --> 10:39.764
talking your ear off.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.518
After last night,

10:43.560 --> 10:46.187
I wouldn't have blamed you
if you needed a minute.

10:48.940 --> 10:52.360
It was... kind of intense.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.695
No, no, no.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.031
It was good intense.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.991
Come on.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.452
I like dissecting cadavers

11:00.493 --> 11:02.579
and singing old Moroi opera
in the shower, okay?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.331
Normal is boring.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.918
Normal can kiss
my Strigoi-smelling,

11:08.960 --> 11:11.588
opera-singing arse.

11:18.428 --> 11:22.182
You are everything
that I've ever hoped for,

11:22.223 --> 11:24.434
and then some.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.644
And I'm completely here for it.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.775
Thank you.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.402
I'll see you tonight, okay?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.404
I'll swing by when I'm done.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.059
Captain.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.479
Status?

12:09.521 --> 12:10.855
The trackers in the squibs

12:10.897 --> 12:12.899
have Alpha Team arriving
to their objective

12:12.941 --> 12:14.234
in less than an hour

12:14.275 --> 12:17.195
with about 45 minutes to spare
until sunset.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.906
Bravo Team arrived in the area
about 15 minutes ago

12:19.948 --> 12:21.700
and are setting up base camp.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.911
Alberta.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.371
A word, please?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.790
Dimitri, you as well.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.458
- Give us the room.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.918
Everyone clear out.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.423
Very quietly, I need you
to call off the field test

12:36.464 --> 12:38.550
and bring everyone in.
- Impossible.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.677
They went radio silent
when they arrived on site.

12:40.719 --> 12:44.097
Then send someone
to retrieve them.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.852
What's going on?

12:48.893 --> 12:51.187
The Royal Council
has approved live fire.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.860
I'll gather a unit.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.319
Stand down, Dimitri.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.617
That is an order, Guardian.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.870
May I remind you that the will
of the Royal Council

13:06.911 --> 13:08.413
is absolute?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.041
Our duty is to protect
the Moroi and the Academy,

13:11.082 --> 13:12.751
not to coddle our own.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.461
You knew about this.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.046
As of 15 minutes ago.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.965
But your fight, Lord Dashkov,
is with the Council.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.216
We follow their orders.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.468
If you're willing
to risk treason,

13:21.509 --> 13:24.846
you will face
the consequences alone.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.723
- Dimitri--
- Dimitri will do as he's told.

13:40.236 --> 13:44.074
Do the Guardians
out there know?

13:44.115 --> 13:46.159
How could you?
- Don't fucking lecture me.

13:46.201 --> 13:49.412
I have no choice.
I do what I'm told.

13:49.454 --> 13:53.875
You should really have
more faith in Rose's abilities,

13:53.917 --> 13:57.045
especially considering
all the extra training

13:57.087 --> 13:58.505
you've been providing her.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.055
They can handle it.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.640
She can handle it.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.476
If she can't, Bravo Team will.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.466
Take a quick breather.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.803
Well, this certainly isn't
the accommodation

14:46.845 --> 14:48.596
I was expecting.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.933
Never seen a human church
in person before.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.643
Do you think they know
anything about us

14:53.685 --> 14:55.812
or St. Vladimir?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.605
I hope not.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.650
We don't need their shit
spilling over into our shit.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.027
I don't know.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.612
Human shit's kind of my thing.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.365
That doesn't sound
the way you think it does.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.826
It does explain
her bad taste,

15:09.868 --> 15:12.037
if her crush on Mia
wasn't enough.

15:12.078 --> 15:16.207
There's a heart in there,
if you dig around a bit.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.627
Well, what can I say?
I like what I like.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.632
I'm gonna walk the perimeter,

15:24.674 --> 15:25.842
try to strategize a defense.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.093
Don't bother.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.470
By the time you see
Bravo Team coming,

15:28.511 --> 15:30.180
it'll be too late.
- You noticed that too.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.098
It's hard not to
when you're standing

15:32.140 --> 15:34.017
at the bottom of a bowl.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.393
Can I see that map
for a second?

15:42.067 --> 15:43.651
Maybe this is part of the test.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.863
To see if we're
dumb enough to stay

15:46.905 --> 15:49.240
in an indefensible location.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.117
There's another structure here.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.079
If we leave now,
we can make it by sunset.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.955
It's doable,
and it's close enough

15:55.997 --> 15:59.501
to set up a communication relay
to keep an eye on this area.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.545
One more thing.

16:02.587 --> 16:06.299
Alberta said to survive
by any means necessary.

16:08.259 --> 16:11.429
They can't fail us
if there's no patches to pop.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.060
See?

16:17.102 --> 16:18.520
She gets it.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.572
<i>Overturning
the Council's decision</i>

16:29.614 --> 16:33.201
would set a dangerous precedent
in the transition of power.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.120
This is not
an ordinary circumstance

16:35.161 --> 16:37.539
nor an ordinary transition
of power, Your Majesty.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.792
I will not incite
political upheaval

16:40.834 --> 16:42.252
even for you.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.337
If you are so troubled by it,

16:44.379 --> 16:48.550
perhaps you should finally
consider running for the throne

16:48.591 --> 16:51.761
instead of clinging
to its coattails.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.307
Are we done?

17:00.145 --> 17:02.022
Your Majesty.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.338
Why the sudden interest
in the Moroi art of yore?

17:27.672 --> 17:31.551
I--art's kind of always
been my happy place.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.053
Yeah.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.138
Rose and I had this plan,
after graduation,

17:35.180 --> 17:38.141
we'd go on this crazy
worldwide art crawl.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.810
I've met the collector
who donated this piece.

17:40.852 --> 17:44.439
It's a shame you won't be
joining us in the Royal Tour.

17:45.190 --> 17:49.486
He's a lot, but he knows
how to throw a party.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.654
Tradition's tradition,
I guess.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.240
No quorum, no Royal Tour,

17:54.282 --> 17:55.742
although you must know that.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.331
Given your detailed awareness
of the law.

18:01.373 --> 18:04.334
What I do know is that
you should have the right

18:04.376 --> 18:07.671
to choose a spouse
when you're ready,

18:07.712 --> 18:10.256
not because Victor Dashkov
is desperate for votes.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.508
He just wants
what's best for me.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.260
If that were true,
he would have found a way

18:14.302 --> 18:17.472
to prevent a Strigoi from being
released on your friends

18:17.514 --> 18:20.809
out playing
their little war games.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.897
<i>This location
will definitely work.</i>

18:25.939 --> 18:27.691
Bravo Team won't
suspect a thing.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.526
Dean, you'll be midpoint
of the relay.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.361
Herk, you keep watch
over the church.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.196
You see anything,
you signal Dean.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.031
I'll stand by first guard here.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.783
Two flashes,
and I come running.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.785
Stay low, stay quiet.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.245
- Got it.
- Got it.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.539
We can do this.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.581
I know we can.

18:47.002 --> 18:49.587
Now that was leadery.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.214
Not bad, Hathaway.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.299
Not bad yourself, Beckham.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.884
Prayers won't help Rose,
but you can.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.273
Look, I agree this is fucked,

19:50.315 --> 19:52.067
but what you want to do
is insane.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.152
Running out into the field?
How would you defend yourself?

19:54.194 --> 19:55.612
Because I don't think
compelling a Strigoi to death

19:55.653 --> 19:56.988
is gonna work.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.782
Well, it's better
than not trying at all.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.325
I need you.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.410
You have a handle on your magic
that's more than just

20:02.452 --> 20:03.787
some stupid party trick.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.246
I have to warn Rose.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.748
You just told Dimitri.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.125
Well, what if he doesn't
find them in time?

20:09.167 --> 20:11.836
Or what if the Strigoi
find them first?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.672
If the situation were reversed,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.090
Rose wouldn't hesitate
to come for me.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.093
That's what she's been
trained to do,

20:20.178 --> 20:23.932
An argument I see now
holds no weight with you.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.809
Ugh,
Rose is gonna kick my ass

20:25.850 --> 20:27.352
for letting you do this.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.312
Let's get her
and everyone home safely

20:29.354 --> 20:31.398
so she can do just that.

20:31.439 --> 20:34.818
But they're offsite.
How we gonna get there?

20:34.859 --> 20:36.820
Got it covered.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.572
You're not gonna like it,
but it's handled.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.078
<i>* We are the future ♪</i>

20:45.120 --> 20:46.579
<i>♪ We are the now ♪</i>

20:46.621 --> 20:51.418
A wannabe royal, a Dhamp,
and a sad little outcast.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.170
That's as low as a peanut
gallery as there ever was.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.672
And yet we still have
people we care about

20:55.714 --> 20:57.674
that are worth saving.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.719
What's your excuse for being
such a lonely asshole?

21:02.053 --> 21:04.264
Feel free to get out
and walk at any time,

21:04.305 --> 21:07.225
preferably while
the car is moving, then.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.477
And last I checked,
it was the responsibility

21:09.519 --> 21:12.105
of the Guardians
to protect the Moroi,

21:12.147 --> 21:15.734
not the other way around,
just in case you've forgotten.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.777
You could have just said no, okay?

21:17.819 --> 21:19.362
You didn't have
to come with us.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.865
Well, when the last Dragomir
comes knocking,

21:21.906 --> 21:24.242
you answer, right?

21:24.284 --> 21:26.036
Who knows?

21:26.077 --> 21:28.246
You might find a way
to make it up to me.

21:33.084 --> 21:36.046
Ah, come on, Lissa.

21:36.087 --> 21:40.383
There are far worse Moroi
to fuck to erase a debt.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.343
Such a perv.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.803
Just shut up
and drive, Jesse.

21:43.845 --> 21:47.182
Hey, hang the next right.
I think I know where they are.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.683
Okay, big man.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.964
You should watch your six.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.557
Hey.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.602
Look what we caught.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.938
Should we throw it back?

22:34.979 --> 22:36.981
I'm just here to grade
your defense strategy

22:37.023 --> 22:38.525
for Bravo Team,

22:38.566 --> 22:41.444
but it looks like you guys
have it well in hand.

22:43.154 --> 22:46.449
I'm impressed, Rose,
though I should warn you

22:46.491 --> 22:48.410
some of the Guardians
are chomping at the bit

22:48.451 --> 22:50.954
to one-up
Janine Hathaway's daughter.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.288
I'm ready.

22:52.330 --> 22:55.208
Well, it's not good enough
to just be ready.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.878
Show them that you're not
Janine Hathaway's daughter.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.007
Show them that she's
Rose Hathaway's mum.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.468
'Cause I've got 1,000 mirs
riding on it.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.722
Which I'd happily split
with you.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.056
- Deal.
- Mm.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.647
And I won't give you shit
that you've taken

23:17.689 --> 23:19.733
the easy job in all of this.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.109
You've got this, Rose.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.028
And don't worry,
your super-secret

23:23.069 --> 23:24.946
defense strategy
is safe with me.

23:24.988 --> 23:27.032
Now I have a date to get to.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.172
That's a pretty melody.

23:42.213 --> 23:44.341
It's from an Old Moroi opera.

23:44.382 --> 23:47.677
Since when do you like opera?

23:52.891 --> 23:54.434
Alpha Team is in position.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.186
Bravo Team, do you copy?

24:00.398 --> 24:01.858
What the fuck?

24:10.825 --> 24:12.911
Hey.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.319
Your Majesty.

25:28.361 --> 25:31.281
These interruptions
are getting tiresome, Victor.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.615
Vasilissa Dragomir
was seen leaving

25:32.657 --> 25:35.035
the palace grounds along
with a few other students.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.536
Care to guess
where they were headed?

25:36.578 --> 25:39.122
- On whose authority?
- My guess is their own.

25:39.164 --> 25:42.917
Please, I implore you.
Stop the test.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.127
You are the only one
with the power

25:44.169 --> 25:45.462
to take emergency measures

25:45.503 --> 25:47.922
and overturn
the Council's decision.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.299
Who else was with her?

25:49.341 --> 25:52.594
Jesse Zeklos,
Christian Ozera,

25:52.635 --> 25:55.055
Mason Ashford,

25:55.096 --> 25:56.848
and my daughter.

26:04.064 --> 26:06.566
Hey, stop!

26:06.608 --> 26:08.276
What are you doing?

26:08.318 --> 26:09.486
Where's Rose?

26:09.527 --> 26:13.323
Lissa,
what are you doing here?

26:13.365 --> 26:14.657
There's a Strigoi
loose in the area.

26:14.699 --> 26:15.825
They set it free.
- Whoa, whoa, slow down.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.160
You're not making any sense.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.079
They put a Strigoi
out here with you guys.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.872
What? Bullshit.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.540
- No, it's true.
- Shit.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.417
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would they do that?

26:24.459 --> 26:26.002
- I don't know, but it's true.
- Whoa, whoa.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.337
How do you know that?
- I just do.

26:27.379 --> 26:29.255
Look, Mia and Jesse are
waiting in the car,

26:29.297 --> 26:30.840
but we have to warn
the instructors.

26:30.882 --> 26:32.175
Mia's here.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.385
- Meredith!
- Wait, Rose!

26:33.426 --> 26:34.761
We have to warn the others.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.513
But we don't know
where the instructors are.

26:36.554 --> 26:38.181
How the hell
did you even find us?

26:38.223 --> 26:40.183
- I know how you think, Rose.
- Good.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.935
Then help me figure out
what I would do next.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.479
You'd have Dean go get Herk,
but we already did that.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.022
He said to wait in there.

26:46.064 --> 26:48.149
Okay, let's go.

26:48.191 --> 26:50.151
Come, come, come.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.903
Herk! Herk!

26:51.945 --> 26:54.989
We gotta go.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.702
Herk?

27:10.171 --> 27:11.506
What's taking them so long?

27:11.548 --> 27:12.632
Mia.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.884
Mia, what the hell
are you doing here?

27:14.926 --> 27:17.012
You shouldn't have come.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.014
I was worried.

27:19.055 --> 27:22.851
Aww, I hate to break up
this love fest or whatever,

27:22.892 --> 27:25.228
but where's the rest
of your merry band?

27:25.270 --> 27:27.188
I skipped breakfast
coming out here,

27:27.230 --> 27:28.314
and I'm starving.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.733
I need to feed.

27:29.774 --> 27:33.194
Did you miss
your nap today, Zeklos?

27:33.236 --> 27:35.321
Okay.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.282
Well, this was fun.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.243
Um, I think I'm gonna go now.

27:40.285 --> 27:43.747
Feel free to enjoy
the rest of this shit show

27:43.788 --> 27:45.957
or, I don't know, get in.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.751
I'm only offering once.

27:52.297 --> 27:55.216
You know, you always were
one of the smart ones.

27:56.551 --> 27:59.262
Okay,
what the fuck are you doing?

28:01.473 --> 28:03.058
Give me the keys, Meredith.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.602
- We're not leaving without--
- Give me the fucking keys now!

28:10.774 --> 28:13.193
You know what?

28:13.234 --> 28:15.278
It won't take much
to hold me over.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.571
Just a sip or two.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.114
Try it.

28:18.156 --> 28:20.784
Go on, I'm begging you.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.118
Oh, come on.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.787
It's a win-win, right?

28:23.828 --> 28:26.831
I feed, you get high.

28:26.873 --> 28:27.957
Who knows?

28:27.999 --> 28:31.002
You might even enjoy
being my little...

28:31.044 --> 28:34.422
blood whore...

28:46.059 --> 28:48.812
Mia, what the fuck?

28:54.859 --> 28:57.028
Mia.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.155
Mia, look at me.

28:59.197 --> 29:00.573
It's okay.

29:12.377 --> 29:14.254
You just attacked a Royal.

29:17.966 --> 29:21.928
You won't get away with this,
either of you.

29:34.524 --> 29:35.817
You're okay.
You're okay.

29:35.859 --> 29:38.028
All right?
You're gonna be okay.

29:38.069 --> 29:39.195
What happened?

29:39.237 --> 29:40.321
Hey, where's Herk?

29:40.363 --> 29:42.032
Mikhail caught him.

29:42.073 --> 29:43.616
Mikhail's a Strigoi.

29:43.658 --> 29:46.995
He's--he's--

29:47.037 --> 29:48.288
Oh, fuck.

29:48.329 --> 29:51.124
We need to go now.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.709
Come on.

30:03.345 --> 30:05.555
Shit. Stop.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.186
Stop.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.909
Mikhail?

30:28.286 --> 30:30.205
Wait, Christian!

30:35.460 --> 30:37.420
I don't know
how to control this!

30:47.347 --> 30:48.890
Hey!

30:48.932 --> 30:51.476
Figure something out,
or we're all fucked!

30:52.727 --> 30:54.062
- Okay.
- Rose.

30:54.104 --> 30:55.939
I'll distract him.
You get everyone to the car.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.107
No, Rose, you can't!

30:57.148 --> 30:58.900
What? I can help.

30:58.942 --> 31:00.276
It's my team, my rules.

31:00.318 --> 31:01.569
Please don't do this, Rose.

31:01.611 --> 31:02.821
I'm trusting you, all of you.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.114
Get to the car.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.824
They come first.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.450
Fucking go!

31:07.492 --> 31:08.827
- Go, let's go, let's go.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.036
Go, go, go.

31:12.664 --> 31:14.833
I can't hold this much longer!

31:17.752 --> 31:20.463
- Christian!
- Go!

31:34.853 --> 31:37.272
Stop the bleeding,
then get him in the car.

31:37.313 --> 31:39.357
Eddie, Meredith, come help me
set up the perimeter

31:39.399 --> 31:40.817
until Rose catches up.

31:40.859 --> 31:42.610
Christian!

31:42.652 --> 31:45.113
If you see something, torch it.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.368
Oh.

32:46.049 --> 32:47.133
Hey, hey, hey. Dean.

32:47.175 --> 32:48.385
Dean, look at me.

32:48.426 --> 32:49.678
Dean. Fuck.

33:30.343 --> 33:32.929
Mikhail?

33:32.971 --> 33:34.055
He's gone.

33:34.097 --> 33:35.807
No.

33:35.849 --> 33:36.975
No.

33:37.017 --> 33:39.019
Mikhail.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.228
He's gone.

33:40.270 --> 33:41.354
Mikhail.

33:41.396 --> 33:42.439
He's gone.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.190
No!

33:44.232 --> 33:45.650
Rose. Roza.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.283
Down this way.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.335
Status?

34:14.262 --> 34:16.306
All Moroi accounted for.

34:16.348 --> 34:19.309
Two down--one Novice, Herk,

34:19.351 --> 34:20.977
and Mikhail.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.817
Whoever turned them
is still out there.

34:30.695 --> 34:32.447
We'll fan out and find them.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.282
- Let's move out.
- Get her home.

34:53.093 --> 34:54.386
I was so worried.

34:54.427 --> 34:56.763
- Oh, sore.
- Oh, sorry.

35:02.268 --> 35:05.438
How are you feeling?

35:05.480 --> 35:07.399
Like I've just had
1,000 people

35:07.440 --> 35:10.610
trample over my corpse.

35:10.652 --> 35:12.153
I'm fine.

35:14.197 --> 35:16.324
Promise.

35:18.159 --> 35:20.120
Okay.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.122
So don't freak out.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.943
That's, um... new.

35:53.486 --> 35:55.572
I healed Dean, Rose.

35:57.699 --> 36:01.119
There was so much blood,
and then...

36:01.161 --> 36:04.372
and then
I just fucking healed him.

36:04.414 --> 36:06.458
This is crazy.

36:06.499 --> 36:10.837
I'm actually a Spirit User,
just like St. Vladimir.

36:10.879 --> 36:13.089
And look.

36:13.131 --> 36:14.716
You know
those traveling exhibits

36:14.758 --> 36:18.094
from the museum
that only I go to?

36:18.136 --> 36:19.971
There's this painting.

36:20.013 --> 36:22.349
That's St. Vladimir
Compelling someone.

36:22.390 --> 36:23.850
Think about what this means.

36:23.892 --> 36:28.313
It means that you should
probably just take it easy.

36:28.355 --> 36:30.648
Are you sure
this is a good thing?

36:30.690 --> 36:33.026
Because I've been picking up
on some crazy emo vibes

36:33.068 --> 36:36.321
from you lately.

36:36.363 --> 36:40.075
Well, how could it not be?

36:40.116 --> 36:42.702
Didn't St. Vladimir
live out his life in peace,

36:42.744 --> 36:45.705
like, herding, like, sheep
or something?

36:45.747 --> 36:47.707
There was that nursery rhyme.
Right?

36:47.749 --> 36:52.587
It was like, "St. Vladimir"
something, something...

36:54.130 --> 36:56.800
"To guide him in joy on a"...

36:56.841 --> 36:58.760
both:
"Farm, with Anna beside him."

36:58.802 --> 37:00.387
Yeah.

37:00.428 --> 37:03.515
Vladimir was the founder
of our religion.

37:03.556 --> 37:06.393
Some crazed emo guy
wouldn't be in marble

37:06.434 --> 37:07.894
on every other pedestal.

37:14.109 --> 37:18.613
If I can just talk to the guy
who owns the collection

37:18.655 --> 37:20.990
from the museum,
maybe he could help me

37:21.032 --> 37:22.909
fill in some of the blanks
about Spirit

37:22.951 --> 37:26.579
and how St. Vladimir handled it
without losing his mind.

37:28.415 --> 37:31.584
But I have to know.

37:31.626 --> 37:33.253
Great.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.088
So where is this mystery man?

37:35.130 --> 37:38.008
In Lisbon,

37:38.049 --> 37:40.593
on the Royal Tour.

37:40.635 --> 37:43.763
It's voting families only.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.682
How are you gonna
score an invite?

37:49.978 --> 37:53.273
I don't like you
and you don't like me.

37:53.314 --> 37:56.109
But I have to marry someone
with enough Dragomir blood

37:56.151 --> 37:57.944
to get my quorum back.

37:57.986 --> 38:01.698
And although this would
not be a real marriage,

38:01.740 --> 38:03.575
I should be spending
some time with your parents

38:03.616 --> 38:06.745
before we're
officially engaged.

38:06.786 --> 38:08.830
They are going
on the Royal Tour, right?

38:11.332 --> 38:14.127
Why would you say
such a thing?

38:14.169 --> 38:15.420
I'm so sorry, Sonya.

38:15.462 --> 38:17.797
No.

38:17.839 --> 38:19.758
That's a lie.

38:21.843 --> 38:23.386
She's lying.

38:24.512 --> 38:26.181
Sonya...

38:26.222 --> 38:28.308
It kills you to see me happy.

38:34.481 --> 38:35.857
I'll go.

38:35.899 --> 38:38.860
Sonya.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.236
Sonya, wait.

38:40.278 --> 38:41.821
Sonya. Sonya, please.

38:41.863 --> 38:45.492
No, he can't be dead.

38:45.533 --> 38:47.160
He can't.
- It'll be okay.

38:47.202 --> 38:48.703
I promise.

38:51.331 --> 38:52.999
No.

38:53.041 --> 38:54.584
It won't be.

38:57.003 --> 38:58.505
What are you doing?

38:58.546 --> 39:00.507
- I won't lose you, too.
- Sonya, no.

39:00.548 --> 39:03.009
I need to heal you, Daddy.

39:26.825 --> 39:28.201
Fuck.

39:28.243 --> 39:29.953
Rose.

39:31.413 --> 39:32.997
How do you feel?

39:33.039 --> 39:36.960
Like I killed
a piece of myself.

39:37.002 --> 39:41.297
Like suddenly,
I'm beginning to wonder

39:41.339 --> 39:44.050
if I even want to do this anymore.

39:44.092 --> 39:48.763
I wish I could say
it gets easier, but--

39:48.805 --> 39:50.807
But it fucking sucks?

39:50.849 --> 39:53.226
But it fucking sucks.

40:00.525 --> 40:04.821
I'm sorry
that Lissa got involved.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.907
I'm supposed to prevent her
from getting into danger,

40:07.949 --> 40:09.409
on shift or not.

40:09.451 --> 40:12.412
My mind should have been on her

40:12.454 --> 40:15.165
instead of...

40:15.206 --> 40:17.125
Instead of what?

40:19.294 --> 40:22.505
You,

40:22.547 --> 40:25.425
and whether or not
you were safe.

40:31.264 --> 40:34.476
Hey, Hathaway,
are you in here?

40:42.150 --> 40:43.485
Hey.

40:45.737 --> 40:48.865
How are you holding up?

40:48.907 --> 40:52.202
I'd be a lot better if people
would stop asking me that.

40:55.455 --> 40:57.707
Listen.

40:57.749 --> 41:01.294
We lost one of our own.

41:01.336 --> 41:05.173
I can't fucking begin to know
how to process that.

41:05.215 --> 41:06.966
The thing I do know...

41:09.344 --> 41:13.181
I don't want to be mad at you,

41:13.223 --> 41:15.058
ever.

41:18.520 --> 41:21.981
You're one of the only things

41:22.023 --> 41:24.651
that makes this life
fucking bearable.

41:27.904 --> 41:30.740
I know you're heading out
on the Royal Tour.

41:30.782 --> 41:34.703
But when you get back...

41:37.122 --> 41:39.624
I'll be here waiting

41:39.666 --> 41:42.377
like I've always been.

42:15.076 --> 42:16.661
A success?

42:16.703 --> 42:19.748
You have the audacity
to call four wounded

42:19.789 --> 42:22.459
and seven dead a success?

42:22.500 --> 42:26.921
Seven dead,

42:26.963 --> 42:29.674
including a Moroi guard
and a Dhampir Novice.

42:29.716 --> 42:32.761
It may not be the result
we hoped for,

42:32.802 --> 42:35.555
but it's certainly
the revelation we needed.

42:35.597 --> 42:39.934
We are being hunted
by beings who wish nothing more

42:39.976 --> 42:42.479
than to eradicate our kind.

42:42.520 --> 42:46.900
Yes, seven lives
were sacrificed,

42:46.941 --> 42:50.403
but that was the result
of one Strigoi, only one.

42:50.445 --> 42:52.072
Now imagine a horde--

42:52.113 --> 42:54.908
dozens coming after your wives

42:54.949 --> 42:57.494
and your husbands
and your children.

42:57.535 --> 42:59.329
We need
better-equipped guardians

42:59.371 --> 43:01.790
if we are to survive
with the recent influx

43:01.831 --> 43:03.583
of Strigoi attacks.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.669
We are one
coordinated attack away

43:05.710 --> 43:07.128
from being completely and utt--

43:08.672 --> 43:10.548
Victor.

43:15.804 --> 43:17.430
Over the past 24 hours,
I've done

43:17.472 --> 43:20.684
a great deal of contemplation
regarding our future,

43:20.725 --> 43:24.938
that of our children, and that
of our children's children.

43:24.979 --> 43:26.606
The one thing
I keep coming back to

43:26.648 --> 43:29.275
is that we deserve better.

43:29.317 --> 43:34.447
Moroi and Dhampir alike,
we deserve a better future.

43:34.489 --> 43:37.659
With no other candidate
capable of leading us there,

43:37.701 --> 43:40.078
and after discussing it
with my family,

43:40.120 --> 43:42.414
I've decided to fight for it.

43:42.455 --> 43:45.000
I stand before you
to officially announce

43:45.041 --> 43:48.461
my candidacy for Monarch.

43:56.177 --> 43:59.639
There are things
I have to do for my family,

43:59.681 --> 44:01.933
decisions I have to make.

44:01.975 --> 44:04.310
But I just want you to know

44:04.352 --> 44:08.523
it doesn't change how I feel
about you.

44:08.565 --> 44:10.525
And it doesn't change
how much it meant to me

44:10.567 --> 44:13.611
that you helped save Rose.

44:13.653 --> 44:15.739
Why does it feel like
you're breaking up with me,

44:15.780 --> 44:17.657
even though we're not together?

44:17.699 --> 44:21.494
'Cause I want to be, Christian.

44:21.536 --> 44:23.496
I want to be together.

44:23.538 --> 44:25.248
And I'm so sorry.

44:25.290 --> 44:26.750
I mean, I don't even know
how to tell you this.

44:26.791 --> 44:32.255
Hey.

44:32.297 --> 44:34.716
It's okay.

44:38.511 --> 44:42.265
Whatever you have to do,

44:42.307 --> 44:44.351
you do.
