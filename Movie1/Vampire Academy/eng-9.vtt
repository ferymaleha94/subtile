00:09.884 --> 00:13.680
<i>* â™ª</i>

00:13.722 --> 00:17.392
<i>- In a faith built
on the cycling of Elements,</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:19.519
<i>there is no greater sin</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:22.814
<i>than bringing life back
to the dead.</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:24.733
<i>- Where's Sasha?
- I told her to run.</i>

00:24.774 --> 00:26.276
Do you have any idea
what they'll do to you

00:26.317 --> 00:27.485
if they find out
that you helped?

00:27.527 --> 00:28.445
I'm not sorry.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.696
Where's Guardian Tanner?

00:29.738 --> 00:32.449
Guardian Tanner died
in a Strigoi attack.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.325
Rose and I
remembered everything.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.744
<i>Their parents were there.</i>

00:35.785 --> 00:37.245
They murdered my family.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.913
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.206
Someone
inside the Royal Court

00:40.248 --> 00:43.084
is conspiring with Strigoi
to take Lissa out.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.669
When your family died,

00:44.711 --> 00:46.838
I kept thinking
we could preserve

00:46.880 --> 00:50.717
some little part of that life
before the crash, but we can't.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.428
We both need to find our way
without each other.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.513
Rose, what does that mean?

00:55.555 --> 00:56.765
I have to get out of here.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.558
Remember when you offered
to go with me?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.560
I was just wondering
if the offer still stands.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.062
Yes, Rose.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.732
<i>The crown is yours, Victor.</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:08.151
<i>I only wish Sonya was here
to celebrate with us.</i>

01:08.193 --> 01:09.235
<i>We spoke.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:10.570
She said this was all worth it.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.238
We have shamed the Elements

01:12.280 --> 01:13.782
with the choice
of Victor Dashkov

01:13.823 --> 01:15.575
during these Trials.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.927
You don't understand.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.428
Talk to me, please.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.805
I know you're hurting.
So am I.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.264
No!

01:38.306 --> 01:40.934
You don't get to play the
loving husband and father now.

01:40.975 --> 01:45.438
Victor lied about his health.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.440
And what
of his Strigoi daughter?

01:47.482 --> 01:49.693
How can we trust him
to rule the Dominion

01:49.734 --> 01:52.445
when he can't even
rule his household?

01:52.487 --> 01:55.407
Will he even be around to rule?

02:00.995 --> 02:02.580
People are worried

02:02.622 --> 02:05.166
their province will be
the next St. Jude,

02:05.208 --> 02:07.419
that their brother,
wife, or child

02:07.460 --> 02:09.796
will become
the next Strigoi victim,

02:09.838 --> 02:10.880
or worse,

02:10.922 --> 02:12.841
<i>become a monster
to defend against,</i>

02:12.882 --> 02:14.759
<i>like Sonya Karp.</i>

02:17.053 --> 02:18.805
<i>If anyone knew about Sonya,</i>

02:18.847 --> 02:20.598
there would be no chance for me
to be on the throne.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.393
So you lied
about our daughter.

02:23.435 --> 02:26.563
Sonya healed me
because she believe in me.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.773
That's why I have
to become the king,

02:28.815 --> 02:32.110
to be the man Sonya
believed in, especially now.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.194
People are scared!

02:33.236 --> 02:36.239
Of course people are scared.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.615
Who can blame them?

02:37.657 --> 02:40.493
Our very future is on the line.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.204
We need to fix this
before we cannot.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.085
<i>I can fix this,
fix everything.</i>

02:49.127 --> 02:50.253
We're getting ready

02:50.295 --> 02:52.339
for our daughter's funeral, Victor.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.882
You can't fix that!

02:53.923 --> 02:55.383
Stop it.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.053
Isn't it enough that
Sonya's locked up in a dungeon

02:58.094 --> 03:00.263
until they kill her?

03:06.978 --> 03:08.938
That's not Sonya anymore.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.194
Sonya is gone.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.655
No one feels that
more than I do.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.407
But the only way
to make it worse

03:19.449 --> 03:22.702
is if I abdicate
and Tatiana wins.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.914
You really think
the crown is yours after this?

03:25.955 --> 03:28.917
Tatiana is rallying the Moroi
to her side.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.544
By preying on their fear.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.088
Do you really wanna live
in a realm

03:33.129 --> 03:34.631
ruled by someone
with her values?

03:34.673 --> 03:38.635
Values aren't
about what you say, Victor.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.220
They're about what you do.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.180
Exactly.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.474
My whole life,

03:44.516 --> 03:46.142
I've worked
to make this Dominion

03:46.184 --> 03:47.977
a better place
for our children.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.857
Don't you see?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.943
Taking the throne
is the only way

03:54.984 --> 03:58.655
to honor her sacrifice...

03:58.697 --> 04:03.076
and find some light
in this terrible darkness.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.955
I want to understand, but...

04:06.996 --> 04:10.333
I'm so sorry.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.586
I never asked her to heal me.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.756
And if I had only said no
that night...

04:16.798 --> 04:20.427
But how could I know it would
come at such a terrible cost?

04:20.468 --> 04:23.930
We cannot afford
to sit back and do nothing.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.183
We must act
when it matters most.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.769
And that time is now.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.107
Call upon me,

04:34.149 --> 04:35.483
and I shall serve.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.707
all:
Our queen! Our queen!

04:58.006 --> 05:00.467
We're fucked.
Aren't we, Herald?

05:00.508 --> 05:03.345
Indeed we are,
Your Majesty.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.510
Um, buy a trampoline.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.053
Okay.
Go to a baseball game.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.389
Eat pizza
with pineapple on it.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.391
- No, that's gross.
- Yeah.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.142
Well, I've heard it's a thing.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.019
I've heard it's a thing.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.647
- You've heard it's a thing?
- Mm-hmm.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.943
What is it?

06:01.569 --> 06:04.030
It just seems
like forever ago

06:04.072 --> 06:07.951
that Lissa and I were planning
the same adventure.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.914
It's okay to worry about her.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.249
Maybe.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.252
She's got Dimitri, right?

06:17.293 --> 06:20.588
And I told my mother
about Christian's parents.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.090
It's in her hands now.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.219
It's bigger than us.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.222
I think you should actually
say goodbye to Lissa.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.433
I will.

06:31.474 --> 06:35.478
'Cause then
it's just you and me.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.398
No more trainings.
No more schedule.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.233
No more taking orders.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.068
Like you took orders.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.121
You aren't
the least bit scared?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.668
I'm terrified.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.549
But being terrified and free

07:04.591 --> 07:06.009
beats throwing our bodies
on the line

07:06.051 --> 07:09.095
for a bunch of Royals who
couldn't give a shit about us.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.221
Right?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.516
Right.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.845
Lissa.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.765
Mia, I'm so sorry.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.642
You have to stop.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.060
The healing,
all of it.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.520
I saw you with Dean.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.355
I don't know
what you think you saw,

08:00.397 --> 08:01.564
but that's crazy.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.108
No one can do that.
- You can.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.735
And so could Sonya.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.529
My family thought
that she was the only one,

08:07.570 --> 08:08.822
and then I saw you.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.533
Okay, Mia,
if anyone found out--

08:11.574 --> 08:13.910
I haven't told anyone.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.245
But, Lissa,
the more Sonya healed,

08:15.286 --> 08:16.913
the worse she got.

08:16.955 --> 08:20.208
She hated
seeing anyone in pain.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.626
Even me.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.795
Even though
I wasn't always nice.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.173
She deserved better.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.260
And so do you.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.972
But I'm not like
you and Christian.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.349
What if this power
is my only way to fight?

08:36.391 --> 08:37.600
It's not worth it.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.019
Mia, look,
I know you're upset,

08:39.060 --> 08:41.187
but you don't--
- Of course I'm upset!

08:41.229 --> 08:42.230
Papa is livid.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.191
Dad lied about
Sonya being missing.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.694
I know that my dad
did a terrible thing.

08:47.736 --> 08:51.156
And even though I am furious,

08:51.197 --> 08:55.035
I can't stand
to see him this way.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.579
I can't.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.497
I fucking can't.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.817
Guardian Belikov.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.695
Commander Croft.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.281
It's an honor.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.576
You are under arrest
for treason.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.257
Your
Majesty, it's madness.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.385
- Open brawling in the streets.
- And it's getting worse.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.844
If Your Majesty desires

09:54.886 --> 09:56.596
a Dominion tomorrow
to wake up to,

09:56.638 --> 09:58.473
you must take action.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.518
Take action?

10:01.559 --> 10:04.396
To quell the madness
you wrought yourselves?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.606
Everyone knows
my days are numbered.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.608
Just what would you have me do?

10:08.650 --> 10:10.193
Officially disavow Victor.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.611
Your support still matters

10:11.653 --> 10:14.989
and can unite the Dominion
behind a worthy successor.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.075
The Council
can release a statement

10:17.117 --> 10:18.702
contesting the Trials

10:18.743 --> 10:20.995
and confirming me as queen,

10:21.037 --> 10:24.666
which means,
Your Majesty,

10:24.708 --> 10:28.128
you are free to step down.

10:28.169 --> 10:32.298
You may rest easy
with your legacy in my hands.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.508
No.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.515
The Elements did not
choose you, Tatiana.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.810
I may not like it,
but they chose Victor.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.437
He won the Trials.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.022
Per the church,
he is king.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.651
<i>Guardian Belikov.</i>

10:51.693 --> 10:54.821
Now in the matter of the
Caroni Village resettlement,

10:54.863 --> 10:56.573
aside from the Strigoi attack,

10:56.614 --> 11:01.411
you claim that the mission
was completed without fault.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.038
Is that true?

11:06.666 --> 11:11.087
You also state
that Guardian Sasha Tanner,

11:11.129 --> 11:12.839
with whom you were charged
with remanding,

11:12.881 --> 11:14.924
died in battle.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.885
Is that true?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.184
Guardian Belikov,

11:24.225 --> 11:27.395
the punishment for treason
is very serious.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.237
I stand by my statement.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.159
Very well.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.244
I hope you know
what you're doing.

11:44.913 --> 11:45.997
Take him away.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.548
And bring Guardian Tanner in.

11:57.342 --> 12:01.221
It'll be very interesting
to hear what she has to say

12:01.262 --> 12:03.223
now that we've heard
your side of the story.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.058
Put him under house arrest.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.700
Sit.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.247
Hey, kiddo.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.498
Come and have a seat.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.543
I've been thinking.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.961
I know you're blue
about Lissa--

12:33.003 --> 12:35.380
I know you've been working
with my parents.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.091
Is that why you've been so nice
to me this whole time?

12:38.133 --> 12:39.551
Honey,
you're not making any sense.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.470
Please don't add another lie
to the pile.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.265
Just tell me.

12:45.306 --> 12:50.061
Have you just been using me
to get to Lissa?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.188
You got it all wrong.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.612
Your parents love you.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.449
Why they wanted
the Dragomirs off the throne,

13:02.490 --> 13:03.825
I can't tell you.

13:03.867 --> 13:07.495
But one thing I do know...

13:07.537 --> 13:09.581
they miss you

13:09.622 --> 13:12.751
and just wanna
be together again.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.589
You know,
the Moroi say

13:17.630 --> 13:22.135
becoming Strigoi is
a fate worse than death.

13:22.177 --> 13:25.430
But if you ask the Strigoi,

13:25.472 --> 13:28.183
they call it the Awakening.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.937
What do you mean?

13:32.979 --> 13:36.441
It's like you've been
sleepwalking your whole life.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.985
Everything's more intense--

13:39.027 --> 13:42.405
colors, sounds, touch.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.743
And you never get old.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.749
You want them to turn you.

13:55.919 --> 14:00.465
All I'm saying is
you have options.

14:00.507 --> 14:04.260
You don't have
to be alone ever again

14:04.302 --> 14:05.762
if you don't want to be.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.601
I've seen how everyone's
treated you here.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.149
You deserve better.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.202
I want you
to give them a message.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.246
Tell them...

14:34.708 --> 14:36.710
I'm ready to talk.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.704
I'm the one
that helped Sasha escape.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.582
Sasha chose this.
It's not on you.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.833
What did you tell them?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.293
What do you think?

15:18.335 --> 15:20.086
Nothing.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.379
Keep it that way.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.979
What's going to happen to her?

15:38.021 --> 15:39.981
It's in the hands of HQ now.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.150
Nothing either of us can do.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.943
- And that?
- The tracker?

15:43.985 --> 15:45.362
It's nothing.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.239
Just due process
and proper safeguards.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.450
I'll be fine
once all this blows over.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.827
HQ doesn't let things
"blow over."

15:52.869 --> 15:56.289
The Dominion needs all
the Guardians it has right now.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.875
I'm not entirely without value.

16:01.002 --> 16:05.173
If that was a brag, you need
to step up your game, comrade.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.634
Hard to brag to the woman
who gave me a black eye.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.845
Sorry about that.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.682
Forget it, Roza.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.696
Are all of these about--

16:27.737 --> 16:29.322
Humans.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.323
Biographies.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.450
My way of seeing the world.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.963
Having a staring contest
with the air, are we?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.543
I guess
I'll see you around then.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.173
Yeah.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.134
See you around.

18:00.246 --> 18:05.126
<i>Victor lied
about his health.</i>

18:05.168 --> 18:07.504
<i>And what
of his Strigoi daughter?</i>

18:07.545 --> 18:09.714
<i>How can we trust him
to rule the Dominion</i>

18:09.756 --> 18:12.509
<i>when he can't even
rule his household?</i>

18:31.194 --> 18:34.614
So the rumors are true.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.282
You're not well.

18:38.493 --> 18:41.329
Don't look too kingly now,
do I?

18:41.371 --> 18:44.582
I survived campaign season,

18:44.624 --> 18:46.668
won the Trials.

18:46.710 --> 18:47.752
Even the church--

18:47.794 --> 18:49.963
is on my side now apparently.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.549
But the irony is,

18:52.590 --> 18:56.970
I can't claim victory
because my body is failing me.

18:57.012 --> 19:00.682
I could have
united the Dominion.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.893
But it's over.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.186
Tatiana will be queen.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.314
And I'd hoped
to find peace for us all,

19:08.356 --> 19:12.944
but now
I can't even find my own

19:12.986 --> 19:14.529
after Sonya.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.283
But you have to know
that what happened

19:18.324 --> 19:19.826
wasn't your fault.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.077
You can't beat yourself up

19:21.119 --> 19:23.038
for something
you couldn't possibly control.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.581
How would you know?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.711
I know it may sound crazy,

19:29.753 --> 19:32.756
but there is a reason
Sonya was the way she was.

19:35.925 --> 19:40.096
I think she have had
a special magic called Spirit.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.476
The Fifth Element.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.812
What did you say?

19:50.231 --> 19:53.401
That's why
she never specialized.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.196
But she could do things
like heal,

19:56.237 --> 20:00.325
maybe even dream walk
or see auras.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.660
But with the good comes...

20:02.702 --> 20:04.954
The Darkness.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.374
That's what she called it.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.584
Those times
when she was troubled

20:09.626 --> 20:11.628
and there was nothing
we could do to stop it.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.130
That's what happens
when you use Spirit.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.091
It must have just gotten
to be too much,

20:16.132 --> 20:17.801
and that's why she...

20:19.260 --> 20:22.597
It may not have even
been a conscious choice.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.642
She may have just wanted
to make the pain stop.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.316
How could you know this?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.823
Because I'm like Sonya.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.953
I have Spirit too.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.209
Does that mean
you can also heal?

20:54.004 --> 20:56.381
Sonya was healing you?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.683
Mia.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.319
I bought her a bracelet.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.072
I was gonna give it to her
for her birthday,

21:21.114 --> 21:23.491
but they only told me
that it was ready yesterday.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.910
I just had--
- I'm so sorry.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.999
Is there anything I can--
- No, there's nothing.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.379
We've lost her.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.802
I felt like I was losing you
when I'd only just found you.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.015
When I saw you at the Trials
with all those Royals,

21:47.057 --> 21:51.644
I-I got scared and weird.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.188
And...

21:53.229 --> 21:57.359
I've never felt like this.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.402
For anyone.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.615
And I know I've probably
just made it worse

22:03.656 --> 22:05.742
by saying something today
of all days.

22:05.784 --> 22:09.245
I'm so sorry, Mia.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.540
Don't be.

22:12.582 --> 22:13.625
I just--

22:13.667 --> 22:16.544
my papa is heading out of town

22:16.586 --> 22:18.922
for the treaty re-signing.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.216
As a diplomat,
he has to go, even--

22:23.009 --> 22:25.804
Even with all this, so...

22:25.845 --> 22:27.347
Right, right.

22:30.141 --> 22:34.312
But if you need to talk...

22:34.354 --> 22:36.439
I'll be in the Cistern later.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.970
And you knew
about the Darkness.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.431
You knew using her magic
would hurt her,

23:09.472 --> 23:11.975
but you just kept on
letting her heal you.

23:12.017 --> 23:13.727
I asked her to stop,
but she wouldn't.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.854
Because she couldn't heal
a dying man,

23:15.895 --> 23:17.564
no matter how much
of herself she gave.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.274
You should have refused.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.192
She insisted.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.820
After Mikhail, she was afraid
to lose anyone else.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.491
Sonya never had it easy,
but her real trouble started

23:28.533 --> 23:30.410
after those damn treatments
and therapies

23:30.452 --> 23:32.370
when she didn't specialize.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.748
She was never the same after.

23:34.789 --> 23:37.709
As king, I can make sure
people like Sonya and you

23:37.751 --> 23:39.919
don't have to hide anymore.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.671
Imagine
what would happen to you

23:41.713 --> 23:45.508
if you were exposed as a Spirit
User under Tatiana's reign.

23:45.550 --> 23:48.428
There'd be nowhere to hide
if anyone ever found out.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.481
It's okay.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.608
Listen, I just--

24:01.649 --> 24:03.902
I just need to get
through the coronation.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.528
After that,
the stress will abate,

24:05.570 --> 24:08.156
and I'll be better,
if you help me.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.450
And what happens next time
when you start to fail again?

24:10.492 --> 24:12.827
How can you ask me after Sonya?

24:12.869 --> 24:15.497
If there were
any other way...

24:15.538 --> 24:19.084
But it's that or Tatiana wins.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.379
Even if I wanted to,

24:22.420 --> 24:25.465
I'm on meds
to suppress my magic.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.176
So it'd take hours
to clear my system.

24:41.564 --> 24:42.982
Then I'll see you
in a few hours.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.570
Victor, wha--

24:47.612 --> 24:49.322
Victor, wait!

25:01.626 --> 25:02.711
You better get changed.

25:02.752 --> 25:05.422
We've got fight training in...

25:05.463 --> 25:08.174
If you're doing what I think
you're doing, you're insane.

25:08.216 --> 25:09.426
I know
I should have told you--

25:09.467 --> 25:12.220
I don't care
that you didn't tell me.

25:12.262 --> 25:15.140
I care about my best friend
getting thrown in the dungeons

25:15.181 --> 25:17.517
for going AWOL.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.185
Or worse, getting killed
by some rando Strigoi

25:19.227 --> 25:20.770
in the human world.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.064
- We'll be okay.
- "We"?

25:23.106 --> 25:25.650
Anyone with eyes can see
how she feels about Dimitri.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.235
She asked me to go with her.

25:27.277 --> 25:29.070
Rose is with me now.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.906
Then why did I just see her
coming out of his apartment?

25:31.948 --> 25:33.116
Sweet.

25:34.951 --> 25:38.830
You deserve someone
who loves you.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.165
The way you feel about Rose,

25:40.206 --> 25:42.083
that is
how she feels about Dimitri.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.295
She can't help that
any more than you can.

25:45.337 --> 25:48.131
I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to face the truth.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.134
Like you're so truthful.

25:52.969 --> 25:55.513
If you think that I'm buying
all this family leave time,

25:55.555 --> 25:57.766
I'm not.

25:57.807 --> 25:59.976
I don't know what you do
when you go

26:00.018 --> 26:02.896
or where you go,

26:02.937 --> 26:05.565
but I know it's not hanging out
with your mom at a commune.

26:09.027 --> 26:12.489
Oh, you think you're the
only one who notices things?

26:14.074 --> 26:18.411
I'm not saying
you're not being truthful.

26:18.453 --> 26:22.749
Just that you can't see what's
right in front of your eyes.

26:22.791 --> 26:25.293
Rose doesn't love you.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.222
Fuck.

26:45.063 --> 26:48.483
Guardian Belikov,
it appears you either lied

26:48.525 --> 26:51.236
in your mission report
that Guardian Tanner was dead

26:51.277 --> 26:53.822
or someone else led you
to believe she was.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.824
And with your spotless record

26:55.865 --> 26:57.951
and insistence
that you stand by your story,

26:57.992 --> 27:01.079
I have to ask...

27:01.121 --> 27:02.622
are you lying?

27:05.667 --> 27:09.045
Or are you covering
for another Guardian?

27:09.087 --> 27:10.338
Or both?

27:16.386 --> 27:18.930
I was the commanding officer.

27:18.972 --> 27:21.349
I was responsible
for the veracity

27:21.391 --> 27:24.227
of the information I relayed.

27:24.269 --> 27:28.189
Any gap between my report
and the truth

27:28.231 --> 27:30.734
rests solely on me,

27:30.775 --> 27:33.820
as should the punishment
for giving false information.

27:35.739 --> 27:38.825
You haven't
answered my question.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.744
I have nothing further
to say.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.332
Though I wonder

27:46.374 --> 27:49.044
at your prioritizing
punishing a Guardian

27:49.085 --> 27:50.795
during a time of civil unrest.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.630
How can we expect
any kind of order

27:52.672 --> 27:55.050
if we allow a Guardian
to disobey?

27:55.091 --> 27:57.635
Guardian Belikov,
you have me no choice.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.555
I declare you guilty
of treason.

28:00.597 --> 28:02.057
You'll be taken to the dungeons

28:02.098 --> 28:03.933
until you are sentenced
by the Queen.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.772
May the Saints
have mercy on you.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.824
"Plans changed"?

29:09.749 --> 29:11.251
Ma'am,
we're in the weeds out there.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.294
Five more altercations
in the past hour.

29:14.838 --> 29:17.882
Reassign ward units three,
five, and six to town square.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.926
Tell wards to move
to rotating patrols.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.177
- Yes, ma'am.
- Nobody gets in right now.

29:21.219 --> 29:24.222
Please,
just let me talk to her.

29:24.264 --> 29:26.224
Let him through.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.892
- I got another one.
- We're slammed.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.811
It'll have to wait.
- But it can't.

29:29.853 --> 29:31.771
They wanted Sonya Karp.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.064
Well,
that isn't going to happen.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.649
Yeah, but they have something
that we want!

29:34.691 --> 29:36.067
What?

29:37.610 --> 29:39.654
Mia?

29:43.199 --> 29:46.327
We knew they were starting
to coordinate their attacks,

29:46.369 --> 29:49.080
but this must be
some kind of a prank.

29:49.122 --> 29:53.168
Strigoi don't write notes
and bargain.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.003
They aren't this sophisticated.

29:55.045 --> 29:59.299
Well, maybe we've
had them all wrong.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.926
I mean, yes, of course
they're violent and even feral,

30:01.968 --> 30:04.220
but they're more than that.

30:04.262 --> 30:06.514
Well, we've just missed
that for centuries, huh?

30:06.556 --> 30:07.807
I don't know.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.184
Maybe they've evolved.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.978
Maybe they've always been more
than what we knew.

30:12.020 --> 30:14.647
The only ones we meet, we kill.
- Before they kill us.

30:14.689 --> 30:17.400
Look,
even if they could bargain,

30:17.442 --> 30:18.443
I wouldn't trust 'em.

30:18.485 --> 30:19.944
This is not happening.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.699
When I met my mother,

30:24.741 --> 30:29.287
she spoke
and sounded like herself.

30:29.329 --> 30:31.039
Her old self.

30:31.081 --> 30:33.208
Alberta, I think this is real.

30:33.249 --> 30:36.211
I think they don't want Sonya
to be killed.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.588
Then that's too bad for them.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.132
I'm not walking into an ambush.

30:43.843 --> 30:46.054
With Mia out there?

30:46.096 --> 30:48.556
What happened
to "they come first"?

31:11.371 --> 31:12.831
Hello?

31:12.872 --> 31:15.583
James, if you're
still out there, please!

31:52.287 --> 31:55.832
You know what that means.

31:55.874 --> 31:57.292
I thought
you got what you wanted

31:57.334 --> 31:59.002
when I remembered the accident.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.128
Oh, come on.

32:00.170 --> 32:01.838
You're a little happy
to see me.

32:04.466 --> 32:07.886
Except it means
the drugs are out of my system.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.638
Is that so bad?

32:10.680 --> 32:12.766
If Sonya's any indicator.

32:12.807 --> 32:14.351
Apparently, my magic
makes people want

32:14.392 --> 32:17.228
to burn me at the stake
and me want to turn Strigoi.

32:17.270 --> 32:20.482
And makes you able
to sway people and heal them.

32:20.523 --> 32:21.733
It's not all bad.

32:21.775 --> 32:24.652
Except when I do
those things, I hurt Rose.

32:24.694 --> 32:26.029
And I'm trapped in here

32:26.071 --> 32:27.280
with a figment
of my imagination

32:27.322 --> 32:28.740
while I wait for Victor
to come back

32:28.782 --> 32:30.450
and do who knows what--
- Wah.

32:33.703 --> 32:35.038
Excuse me?

32:39.209 --> 32:42.295
You know
what the secret to power is?

32:42.337 --> 32:44.089
It's making
your biggest liability

32:44.130 --> 32:45.382
your greatest strength.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.595
You have a special magic.

32:50.637 --> 32:53.348
You're gonna allow that
to make you weak?

32:53.390 --> 32:54.391
Or strong?

32:57.977 --> 33:01.106
Sorry
to have kept you waiting.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.066
I trust
you've thought things over.

33:30.593 --> 33:32.262
Oh, Lissa.

33:32.303 --> 33:34.597
There's nothing to discuss.

33:34.639 --> 33:36.725
You can't keep me here.

33:36.766 --> 33:40.395
And if there is anything left
of the man I knew,

33:40.437 --> 33:42.313
you'll get out of my way
and let me leave.

33:42.355 --> 33:44.691
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.777
I said let me go.

33:47.819 --> 33:50.321
Vasilissa, please.
Think of the greater good.

33:50.363 --> 33:51.364
You can't be serious.

33:51.406 --> 33:53.992
- Just this once.
- No.

33:59.706 --> 34:02.167
James, if you don't get out
of my way, I'm gonna--

34:02.208 --> 34:03.460
You're gonna what?

34:03.501 --> 34:04.627
This!

34:04.669 --> 34:05.754
Rose!

34:05.795 --> 34:07.255
Dang it, Rose!

34:07.297 --> 34:09.382
You could stop this.

34:09.424 --> 34:11.092
You could stop this
right now, Lissa.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.177
Fine, fine.

34:12.218 --> 34:13.720
You want my power?

34:13.762 --> 34:14.929
Take it!

34:14.971 --> 34:17.098
Take it all!

34:17.140 --> 34:18.683
No, Lissa!

34:23.021 --> 34:25.732
Aah!

34:40.705 --> 34:43.500
Wait, Dimitri.
I heard about the verdict.

34:43.541 --> 34:45.752
Give me five minutes with him,
and I'll wipe out your debt.

34:51.299 --> 34:54.052
I didn't think it was true,
and I'm sorry.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.054
Don't be.

34:56.096 --> 34:58.348
You didn't need to be alone
to say that.

34:59.808 --> 35:01.434
I wanted to tell you...

35:04.145 --> 35:06.189
Rose and I are leaving.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.611
That explains it.

35:11.653 --> 35:13.655
Look, where you're going,
it's not gonna be easy.

35:13.697 --> 35:15.949
I know that.

35:15.990 --> 35:20.328
But I thought maybe it'd help
to know that she'll be okay.

35:21.788 --> 35:23.206
It does.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.085
And I wish you the best.

35:27.127 --> 35:29.045
Rose is meant
for greater things,

35:29.087 --> 35:31.881
and she deserves to be safe.

35:31.923 --> 35:34.551
And happy.

35:34.592 --> 35:35.802
She does.

35:39.222 --> 35:42.559
Never tell her
what's about to happen to me.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.812
If she knows,
she won't leave.

35:48.732 --> 35:50.191
Let's go.

35:55.905 --> 35:59.034
Fuck you, Dimitri.

35:59.075 --> 36:00.869
Fuck you.

36:18.762 --> 36:20.138
There she is.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.522
You look pretty cocky

36:29.564 --> 36:32.734
for someone who just gave him
exactly what he wanted.

36:32.776 --> 36:34.861
No.

36:34.903 --> 36:37.697
All I gave him was time.

36:37.739 --> 36:41.826
Once his guilt kicks in--
and it will eventually--

36:41.868 --> 36:43.536
that's no favor.

36:44.996 --> 36:46.915
But are you gonna be--

36:46.956 --> 36:49.334
Wait, Rose.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.802
The Darkness,

36:58.843 --> 37:00.387
I can see it.

37:08.687 --> 37:11.898
All this time,

37:11.940 --> 37:13.733
I wasn't passing it to you.

37:13.775 --> 37:17.779
I was taking your light
through our bond.

37:17.821 --> 37:20.156
I don't know
which version sounds worse,

37:20.198 --> 37:22.826
but how?

37:24.494 --> 37:27.497
Magic doesn't fill me
with Darkness.

37:27.539 --> 37:29.124
It depletes my light.

37:29.165 --> 37:31.584
Spirit needs light.

37:34.963 --> 37:36.715
Hey, Rose,
maybe if I

37:36.756 --> 37:40.301
could give myself some time
to fully recover,

37:40.343 --> 37:42.804
you know,
to build back my own light,

37:42.846 --> 37:46.641
because
I won't take yours anymore.

37:46.683 --> 37:50.103
Well, actually,

37:50.145 --> 37:52.522
you won't have
to worry about that now.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.901
I'm leaving.

37:56.943 --> 37:59.279
Leaving? Where?

37:59.320 --> 38:01.031
Out into the world.

38:01.072 --> 38:02.699
Like you and I always planned.

38:02.741 --> 38:04.534
But if I can learn
to control this,

38:04.576 --> 38:05.869
then you don't have to go.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.454
That's not why I'm going.

38:09.039 --> 38:14.169
For so long, all I thought of
was being your Guardian,

38:14.210 --> 38:15.670
and that was enough.

38:15.712 --> 38:17.047
But now,

38:17.088 --> 38:19.966
after everything,

38:20.008 --> 38:24.721
I need to figure out who I am
outside of all of that...

38:27.182 --> 38:29.267
And outside of you.

38:32.937 --> 38:37.442
And given you just came riding
to my rescue,

38:37.484 --> 38:41.529
it looks like you can
take care of yourself now.

38:41.571 --> 38:43.782
We can't have you corner
the whole hero market.

38:51.164 --> 38:52.415
Rose.

38:54.918 --> 38:56.461
I know.

39:02.884 --> 39:06.513
So, um, just you?

39:06.554 --> 39:09.224
Or...

39:09.265 --> 39:11.768
I'm going with Mason.

39:14.688 --> 39:17.107
Stop it.

39:17.148 --> 39:18.400
He's a good guy.

39:20.276 --> 39:23.029
He is.

39:23.071 --> 39:25.990
And it's your life, Rose.

39:26.032 --> 39:28.451
Whatever makes you happy.

39:28.493 --> 39:30.412
But don't get too comfortable, okay?

39:30.453 --> 39:33.081
I have big plans
for this Dominion.

39:33.123 --> 39:36.084
When I'm done with this place,
you're gonna wanna come back.

39:36.126 --> 39:38.169
Just wait.

39:47.012 --> 39:49.597
This isn't goodbye.

39:51.850 --> 39:54.060
No.

39:54.102 --> 39:55.979
It's just see you later.

40:17.167 --> 40:20.045
Woodland secure.
They won't get through.

40:20.086 --> 40:22.380
No one's been able
to reach either of her fathers?

40:22.422 --> 40:23.923
Nothing.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.730
Weapons up.

40:44.152 --> 40:45.445
Hey.
Whoa, whoa.

40:51.659 --> 40:53.286
Where is Mia Karp?

40:58.792 --> 41:00.919
Mia.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.879
What did you do?

41:02.921 --> 41:05.799
She's fine.
For now.

41:10.970 --> 41:12.889
You look so shocked.

41:15.809 --> 41:18.103
We have what you asked for.

41:18.144 --> 41:19.896
Let Mia go,
and we'll give you Sonya.

41:19.938 --> 41:22.315
Sonya first.

41:22.357 --> 41:25.110
Or she dies.
- Absolutely not.

41:25.151 --> 41:28.113
We have you outnumbered
and outgunned.

41:28.154 --> 41:30.949
Mia first,
then Sonya.

41:30.990 --> 41:32.784
Or we walk.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.847
She's next.

41:53.888 --> 41:56.766
All right.
Everybody, stand down!

41:56.808 --> 41:59.019
Down!

42:07.694 --> 42:09.571
If you kill Mia,

42:09.612 --> 42:11.948
there is nothing stopping us
from torching you all.

42:14.284 --> 42:16.828
We exchange simultaneously.

42:16.870 --> 42:20.790
When we drop the wards.

42:20.832 --> 42:24.169
After Andre
and my parents died,

42:24.210 --> 42:27.339
you believed in me,
before even I did.

42:27.380 --> 42:28.757
Since then,

42:28.798 --> 42:33.970
this Dominion has been
on a wild ride, Your Majesty,

42:34.012 --> 42:36.014
leaving no candidate untarnished

42:36.056 --> 42:39.351
and our people
as divided as ever.

42:39.392 --> 42:41.311
I know I need
to get my quorum back,

42:41.353 --> 42:43.355
to marry,
and to learn,

42:43.396 --> 42:46.107
and all of that will take time.

42:46.149 --> 42:50.028
But I have a proposal for you

42:50.070 --> 42:52.614
if you're willing to hear it.

43:14.135 --> 43:15.553
<i>Once again,</i>

43:15.595 --> 43:19.641
<i>I hereby declare
Princess Vasilissa Dragomir</i>

43:19.683 --> 43:22.060
<i>heir to the throne.</i>

43:22.102 --> 43:23.895
<i>But not for today.</i>

43:23.937 --> 43:27.190
For today,
I'm not going anywhere.

43:27.232 --> 43:30.402
I declare the Trials moot.

43:30.443 --> 43:34.072
It is time we put
this whole ugly business,

43:34.114 --> 43:38.243
this whole ugly era,
behind us.

43:38.284 --> 43:41.121
<i>As such,
I shall be keeping the crown</i>

43:41.162 --> 43:44.249
<i>until Vasilissa is ready
to rule.</i>

43:44.290 --> 43:47.794
<i>Such is my decree.</i>

43:59.055 --> 44:00.765
You're late.

44:00.807 --> 44:02.475
Where have you been?

44:02.517 --> 44:06.062
Sorry, I just had
some last-minute stuff.

44:06.104 --> 44:09.649
For a second, I thought you
might have changed your mind.

44:18.950 --> 44:20.994
Never.

44:22.662 --> 44:24.706
What?

44:24.748 --> 44:27.667
You're being weird.

44:27.709 --> 44:29.502
I'm just excited.

44:31.004 --> 44:33.631
You ready for the adventure?

44:33.673 --> 44:36.301
I was born ready.

44:48.646 --> 44:49.981
Lower the wards.

45:19.386 --> 45:21.388
Sonya, I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

45:21.429 --> 45:22.972
I won't forget you, Sonya!
I promise.

45:23.014 --> 45:25.016
I love you, Sonya.

45:34.776 --> 45:36.528
Wards, back up!

45:40.448 --> 45:42.367
I'm taking this back
to the vault.

45:42.409 --> 45:44.744
One wrong move,
and you kill them.

45:58.258 --> 46:01.761
After all that,
you're just gonna leave?

46:07.183 --> 46:09.477
We've done
what we came to do.

46:11.271 --> 46:13.648
Everyone told me
you guys were monsters.

46:13.690 --> 46:16.192
There wasn't a day that went by
that I didn't defend you.

46:16.234 --> 46:18.445
I even wanted to join you
because I thought...

46:21.281 --> 46:24.909
I thought somewhere inside,
you--

46:24.951 --> 46:26.953
you must still love me.

46:26.995 --> 46:29.706
You always were a good boy.

46:29.748 --> 46:32.917
So if you don't care
about me,

46:32.959 --> 46:36.254
why do you care about Sonya?

46:36.296 --> 46:40.008
Is it 'cause she's like you?

46:40.050 --> 46:42.302
Is she your family now?

46:42.344 --> 46:45.472
We didn't come here
for Sonya.

46:47.057 --> 46:48.808
We came here to feed.

47:33.103 --> 47:36.356
<i>â™ª It's a brand-new day â™ª</i>

47:40.443 --> 47:42.612
<i>â™ª It's a brand-new day â™ª</i>

47:42.654 --> 47:45.156
- Breach the far wards!
- What?

47:45.198 --> 47:48.034
You were the perfect decoy.

47:48.076 --> 47:50.662
It's sad how stupid Moroi are.

47:50.704 --> 47:52.831
Though it makes them easy prey.

48:06.011 --> 48:10.724
I'm never gonna let you
hurt anybody ever again!

48:15.270 --> 48:17.188
No!

48:18.898 --> 48:23.194
You haven't begun
to know the meaning of hurt!

48:23.236 --> 48:24.946
Lissa is mine!

48:24.988 --> 48:28.700
<i>* Scratch the surface â™ª</i>

48:33.413 --> 48:35.874
<i>â™ª Through demon â™ª</i>

48:37.542 --> 48:39.586
Come on, Marie.
This way.

48:39.627 --> 48:41.838
How could they possibly
breach the wards?

48:41.880 --> 48:44.215
It's St. Jude's
all over again!

48:45.759 --> 48:49.095
<i>â™ª Water drips like blood â™ª</i>

48:53.600 --> 48:57.187

49:05.612 --> 49:07.197

49:09.783 --> 49:13.328
<i>â™ª Try and stop my reign â™ª</i>

49:13.370 --> 49:17.248
<i>â™ª I can take the pain â™ª</i>

49:17.290 --> 49:20.710
<i>â™ª You will face the silence â™ª</i>

49:20.752 --> 49:24.422
<i>â™ª If you try to fight it â™ª</i>

50:00.959 --> 50:02.544
I tried diplomacy.

50:02.585 --> 50:05.130
I tried preaching
your ridiculous Saints.

50:05.171 --> 50:06.756
I'm done playing nice.

50:06.798 --> 50:09.384
So fuck the Queen
and fuck your sister.

50:09.426 --> 50:10.927
Fuck it all.

50:12.554 --> 50:15.890
Now we're doing things my way, Andre.
