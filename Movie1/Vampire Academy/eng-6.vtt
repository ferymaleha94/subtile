[dramatic music]

00:10.260 --> 00:13.680
* *

00:13.722 --> 00:16.850
- After nearly
two centuries as your queen,

00:16.891 --> 00:19.477
it is time
to name the next.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.188
- The queen waits
for the Council to speak.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.649
When you do,
I hope you speak my name.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.360
- I'd sooner die
than see you on the throne.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.989
...to officially announce
my candidacy for Monarch.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.534
- I'm actually a spirit user
just like St. Vladimir.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.871
- The darkness will always find
you until you remember!

00:37.912 --> 00:39.456
- Leave me alone!

00:42.292 --> 00:44.127
- Are you sure
this is a good thing?

00:44.169 --> 00:45.879
- If I can just talk
to the guy who owns

00:45.920 --> 00:47.172
the collection at the museum.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.256
- Where is this mystery man?

00:48.298 --> 00:49.883
- On the Royal Tour.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.634
I don't like you,
and you don't like me.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.179
But I have to marry someone
with enough Dragomir blood

00:54.220 --> 00:55.388
to get my quorum back.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.015
They are going on
the Royal Tour, right?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.517
- You are everything
that I have ever hoped for.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.896
- [screeching]

01:02.937 --> 01:04.147
- [grunts] Ahh!

01:04.189 --> 01:05.148
[gurgling]

01:05.190 --> 01:06.232
- Mikhail?

01:06.274 --> 01:08.026
* *

01:08.068 --> 01:09.778
- [screams]
- [grunts]

01:09.819 --> 01:11.112
- Ahh!

01:12.238 --> 01:14.532
- Mikhail.
[sobbing]

01:16.701 --> 01:19.662
[somber music]

01:19.704 --> 01:25.335
* *

01:25.377 --> 01:29.130
- Rose, everything
changes today.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.425
The Molnija is a sacred tattoo
given to a guardian

01:32.467 --> 01:34.636
for each Strigoi kill

01:34.678 --> 01:37.514
and one of the highest honors
a Guardian can receive.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.602
Your first Molnija mark
is a rite of passage.

01:42.644 --> 01:46.606
I wish I could be there,
but duty comes first.

01:54.239 --> 01:58.576
[voices chanting]

02:05.500 --> 02:08.586
[chanting continues]

02:24.477 --> 02:27.188
[breathing shakily]

02:49.085 --> 02:50.545
- Thanks, Mikhail.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.385
[mysterious music]

02:57.427 --> 03:03.850
* *

03:03.892 --> 03:06.519
- [non-English speech]

03:12.609 --> 03:14.361
[screaming]
- [grunts]

03:14.402 --> 03:16.279
- Mikhail!

03:25.080 --> 03:27.207
I can't. I can't.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.959
[panting]

03:39.344 --> 03:40.762
* *

03:40.804 --> 03:43.056
[howling]

03:43.098 --> 03:50.271
* *

03:57.904 --> 04:00.657
- You have to stop
blaming yourself.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.659
- I killed one of
my only friends.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.995
- You didn't kill Mikhail.
You killed a Strigoi.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.459
You saved us, Rose.
All of us.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.503
- [sniffling]

04:18.133 --> 04:21.511
So Jesse Zeklos?

04:21.553 --> 04:23.138
That's the best you could do?

04:23.179 --> 04:25.348
- Look, I've got
him under control.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.935
- Lissa.
- I'm not compelling him.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.104
And I won't.

04:31.146 --> 04:35.150
But this is why I have
to go on the Royal Tour.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.153
This Ivashkov guy...

04:38.194 --> 04:41.656
I mean, he can know
a lot more about spirit

04:41.698 --> 04:45.535
and this darkness
that I've been feeling.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.288
And you know
I need my quorum back

04:48.329 --> 04:50.707
'cause if I can help
even a little

04:50.749 --> 04:54.878
to stop what happened to
Mikhail from happening again,

04:54.919 --> 04:56.755
I have to try.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.009
Jesse's really the only
viable option for all of that.

05:01.051 --> 05:05.138
- In a nice,
neat pervert package.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.973
- [chuckles]

05:07.015 --> 05:09.768
- I'll do what I have to do.
- Victor.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.770
- Robert, this election
is too important.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.813
There's something wrong with
the moral center of our society

05:13.855 --> 05:15.732
when we start calling
a training exercise

05:15.774 --> 05:18.109
that leaves
seven dead a success.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.487
- Dhampirs are expendable.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.238
- No one said that.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.074
- But that's what they think.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.495
Is Meredith going on the tour?

05:28.536 --> 05:30.914
- Yeah, she made the cut.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.002
- Make sure you spend time
with her, as much as possible.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.545
- Sonya...

05:38.713 --> 05:41.466
The time that
you spent with Mikhail...

05:41.508 --> 05:43.093
he'll always have that.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.219
He will always be with you.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.346
- Dad's medication schedule.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.847
Make sure he follows it.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.809
- And make sure he gets
plenty of rest between events.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.019
- I already built breaks
into the schedule

05:53.061 --> 05:55.397
and compiled all of the intel
we need for the campaign

05:55.438 --> 05:56.690
so Dad doesn't need
to lift a finger.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.858
- You spoil me.
- [chuckles]

06:00.110 --> 06:01.361
Oh, the car's early.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.905
- Mia Karp.
- Yeah?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.700
- You're required to report
for an ecclesiastic reprimand

06:06.741 --> 06:09.494
for willfully using
your magic against a Royal.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.037
- But I'm going on the tour.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.415
- Failure to report
will result in your expulsion

06:13.456 --> 06:16.001
from St. Vladimir's Academy.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.544
- Fucking Jesse.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.714
- Mia, did you?

06:20.755 --> 06:22.924
- It's not a big deal.
- Using magic as a weapon

06:22.966 --> 06:23.925
is forbidden.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.052
It's a sin.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.680
- You can forget
about the Royal Tour.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.765
- But you can't go on your own.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.228
- I can go.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.063
Let me help.

06:37.105 --> 06:43.111
* *

06:43.153 --> 06:46.072
[dramatic string music]

06:46.114 --> 06:53.079
* *

06:55.832 --> 06:59.586
- The Royal Tour has
always been an ideal excuse

06:59.627 --> 07:01.796
for excess and indulgence,

07:01.838 --> 07:04.924
as we party hop from
one province to another,

07:04.966 --> 07:07.344
reuniting with old friends.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.929
But this year is different.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.307
Tonight, I welcome you all

07:12.349 --> 07:14.059
as we begin our caucus

07:14.100 --> 07:16.519
to choose
the next heir to the throne.

07:16.561 --> 07:21.733
But first, we need to discuss
the future of the Dominion.

07:21.775 --> 07:26.237
Many of you simply want me
to choose an heir,

07:26.279 --> 07:29.157
but the level of
divisiveness in our society

07:29.199 --> 07:31.409
now makes that impossible.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.828
The decision is now
in your hands,

07:33.870 --> 07:37.665
a decision that could
impact the next 200 years.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.335
So I implore you,

07:40.377 --> 07:43.713
set aside your party politics

07:43.755 --> 07:47.217
and choose an heir that
can unite the Dominion,

07:47.258 --> 07:49.552
not tear it apart.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.689
[indistinct chatter]

08:05.235 --> 08:07.237
- Here's to the caucus.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.159
- Jesse Zeklos?
That's who she chose?

08:13.201 --> 08:14.994
- That's a good match.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.580
Zeklos is a powerful
Elementalist.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.082
We get them on our side,

08:19.124 --> 08:21.793
we could
save young Dhampir lives.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.588
Mmm.
Find out what Mia has to say

08:25.630 --> 08:27.549
about Dane Zeklos.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.554
- My dad's pressuring me
for a Marking Ceremony date.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.307
- And I'll be happy to give him
one, once I get what I want.

08:37.892 --> 08:42.397
An invitation to
the Ivashkov Trust Party.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.858
- There's no way I'm getting
you an invitation to that.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.236
You have to be on some
fucking exclusive list.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.238
- Lady Dragomir.
Son.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.866
- Well, then, I'll have to try
someone with some real power.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.911
Lord Zeklos.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.916
- Mia always
overcomplicates things.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.296
[sighs] What?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.262
[exhales]

09:14.304 --> 09:17.223
[uneasy music]

09:17.265 --> 09:20.894
* *

09:20.935 --> 09:23.396
- Dad, no. Dad, don't.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.106
Please, please, no, Dad!

09:27.400 --> 09:31.488
- You're a disgrace.
You'll ruin this family.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.448
- You okay?

09:33.490 --> 09:36.493
- Um, Mia says a lot.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.912
Lord Zeklos is ashamed
of Jesse,

09:38.953 --> 09:40.997
and Jesse's terrified
of his dad.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.833
- Mm, a family of secrets.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.502
I can work with that.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.297
- There's a lot of good stuff
in Mia's notes. [chuckles]

09:53.009 --> 09:55.720
- We may have
underestimated Sonya Karp.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.514
- Mm.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.392
He seems to be
taking her advice.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.186
He's targeting your base.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.190
Dane Zeklos could effect
other votes for him.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.656
- [gasps]

10:15.949 --> 10:18.743
[whooshing]

10:18.785 --> 10:21.329
- It's all just
a numbers game, really.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.540
Our dear Lady Vogel here,
she understands.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.667
More bodies in the field

10:25.709 --> 10:27.419
means stronger security
in the long run.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.130
- Only one novice died
in the Benchmark Tests.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.424
They're clearly capable
at a younger age.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.177
The rest of the dead
were seasoned Guardians.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.972
Perhaps they need
to be tested more regularly

10:39.014 --> 10:40.765
to make sure
they're not past their prime.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.142
- Is she serious right now?

10:42.183 --> 10:44.978
- Who's the asshole
with Tatiana?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.897
- Mason's dad, Stefan Carter.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.942
- You mean the guy Mason
idolized till he was 12?

10:52.027 --> 10:54.654
He's throwing all of us
under the bus.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.448
- Not just us.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.533
Non-Royals, too.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.077
He's making bank
moving nine Royals

11:01.119 --> 11:02.370
from the villages that lost
their Guardians

11:02.412 --> 11:03.830
to the Relocation Centers.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.790
He gets 5,000 mira per head.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.001
- Slimy fucker.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.712
I heard they're pulling
Guardians off detail

11:10.754 --> 11:12.380
to help with the relocation.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.257
- Wait, which villages?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.925
- All of them.

11:15.967 --> 11:20.597
St. Ignatius, St. Judes,
St. Vladimir Provinces.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.057
- Mikhail
was from Caroni Village

11:22.098 --> 11:24.642
here in St. Ignatius, right?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.019
- I think so.

11:26.061 --> 11:29.189
[light tense music]

11:29.230 --> 11:36.154
* *

11:38.365 --> 11:40.825
- I want in
on relocation duty.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.494
Caroni Village.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.287
I can do it.
- No.

11:44.329 --> 11:47.374
Novices were brought here
to shadow the Tour.

11:47.415 --> 11:51.711
- I'm the first Novice since
my mother to kill a Strigoi.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.381
My talents would be
better suited elsewhere,

11:54.422 --> 11:56.257
don't you think?

11:57.759 --> 11:59.969
- Fine. Report to Head Command

12:00.011 --> 12:02.389
for the Caroni
relocation immediately.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.515
- Great.
[sighs]

12:04.849 --> 12:07.060
Who's Head Command?

12:08.895 --> 12:10.563
- I am.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.566
[dark music]

12:13.608 --> 12:19.614
* *

12:25.537 --> 12:26.830
[indistinct chatter]

12:26.871 --> 12:29.791
[light tense music]

12:29.833 --> 12:31.376
* *

12:31.418 --> 12:32.752
- Two Martinis.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.547
One bloody.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.050
- Silver, what the hell
are you doing here?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.428
This is fucking
invitation only.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.055
- Well, the invitation
said plus one.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.975
- [scoffs] Who'd bring you
as their plus one?

12:47.017 --> 12:49.644
- Your dad's business partner.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.896
He likes the unconventional

12:51.938 --> 12:54.232
in all kinds of ways.

12:54.274 --> 12:59.404
* *

12:59.446 --> 13:01.281
Enjoy your night.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.408
I know I will.

13:11.041 --> 13:18.173
* *

13:23.887 --> 13:26.306
- Hey.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.434
You should ditch that geezer
and come explore with me.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.811
Lots of private spots
in a place like this.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.688
- [chuckles]

13:33.730 --> 13:35.357
No.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.567
I like that geezer.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.778
- What's so fucking
special about him?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.572
- Nothing at all.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.991
But he takes me places,

13:45.033 --> 13:47.369
and he's not ashamed to be
seen with me in public.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.039
Imagine that.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.337
[dark music]

13:57.379 --> 13:59.964
* *

14:00.006 --> 14:01.800
- What the hell do you
think you're playing at?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.426
- Your partner brought her.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.304
- Well, Lars can fuck
whoever he likes.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.224
But as long as you are heir
to the Zeklos name,

14:09.265 --> 14:12.394
these are mine.
- [exclaims, panting]

14:12.435 --> 14:15.980
- You understand me?
- Uh-huh.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.442
- If you fuck up things
with Lissa,

14:19.484 --> 14:21.319
I'll cut them off.

14:22.821 --> 14:29.911
* *

14:40.338 --> 14:42.007
- We're leaving.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.010
- We need to wait for the
convoy back to the hotel.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.054
[tense music]

14:48.888 --> 14:51.683
- We go when I say so.

14:51.725 --> 14:58.606
* *

15:09.075 --> 15:15.331
* *

15:22.464 --> 15:24.799
[crunch]
- [non-English speech]

15:24.841 --> 15:26.176
- [pained grunt]

15:44.277 --> 15:46.613
[continues speaking]

15:49.783 --> 15:52.744
[ethereal music]

15:52.786 --> 15:59.668
* *

15:59.709 --> 16:01.670
- I hate this place.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.381
It's just a bunch of
power-hungry jerks

16:04.422 --> 16:07.967
fucking it up for
everybody else.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.053
You must miss the human world.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.305
- It's no better out there.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.307
Something happen with Lissa?

16:14.349 --> 16:16.601
- Yeah.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.312
But it's a lot of things.

16:19.354 --> 16:25.527
- Well, one thing I can tell
you, love is never easy.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.113
- Thanks for always listening.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.199
- Anything for you.
You know that.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.661
Thank you for walking me.
Now, go find some fun.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.582
- Hey.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.752
- Hey.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.009
You okay?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.678
- You ever just wanna
say fuck it?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.849
- All the time.

16:55.890 --> 16:59.019
- Can you show me how to
use my magic the way you do?

17:10.989 --> 17:13.283
- Are you sure you
want to do this?

17:14.576 --> 17:16.411
- I can't sleep.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.000
I keep seeing him.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.418
Mikhail.

17:23.460 --> 17:28.340
So I thought if I come here

17:28.381 --> 17:30.633
and see his sister Sasha

17:30.675 --> 17:35.180
and their father
to ask their forgiveness,

17:35.221 --> 17:39.768
maybe it would make
my dreams a little better.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.729
[light music]

17:42.771 --> 17:49.694
* *

18:11.049 --> 18:12.509
Sasha.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.264
- Fuck you, Rose.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.980
- I guess I should
have expected that.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.941
- I'll talk to her.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.527
- Leave us, please.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.115
Forgive my daughter.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.996
She was very close
to her brother.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.249
- So was I.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.211
- He talked about you.

18:48.253 --> 18:51.256
Rose Hathaway.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.134
The brilliant wild card.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.763
[chuckles]

18:58.805 --> 19:01.558
[coughing]

19:12.235 --> 19:13.903
- You're Moroi.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.157
You raise Dhampirs.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.868
- We sometimes forget
we're an oddity.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.164
When their mother died,
I couldn't let them be raised

19:24.205 --> 19:27.417
by strangers in some commune.

19:27.459 --> 19:30.337
We became a family here.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.923
This is home.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.678
May I...see it?

19:41.348 --> 19:43.933
The Molnija.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.643
- I didn't--

19:51.232 --> 19:55.487
[exhales] I couldn't disrespect
his memory like that.

19:55.528 --> 19:59.908
- The one thing Mikhail feared

19:59.949 --> 20:02.494
more than anything

20:02.535 --> 20:05.914
was to be turned Strigoi.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.792
You saved him from that.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.170
- But the Molnija, it--

20:12.212 --> 20:15.006
- Honors his life,

20:15.048 --> 20:18.677
not the thing he became.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.137
My son would have
done the same for you.

20:21.179 --> 20:28.311
* *

20:36.236 --> 20:40.240
- [snores softly]

20:40.281 --> 20:41.908
- Eddie.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.581
[tires screeching]

21:11.604 --> 21:13.606
- Can we get on with it?

21:14.274 --> 21:15.775
[crashing]

21:15.817 --> 21:17.527
- [gasps]

21:18.528 --> 21:20.697
[intense music]

21:20.739 --> 21:23.033
- Get back in the car!
- Now!

21:23.074 --> 21:25.035
- You disobeyed
your settlement orders,

21:25.076 --> 21:27.203
allowing all these
Moroi to stay behind,

21:27.245 --> 21:29.039
and spoke treason
against the Council.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.248
- They murdered my brother.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.917
- Mikhail was--

21:32.959 --> 21:34.044
was lost in battle.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.587
- A battle they caused.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.797
And now they want
my father to die,

21:37.839 --> 21:40.425
going to some
Resettlement Center

21:40.467 --> 21:43.553
instead of at the home
he loves.

21:43.595 --> 21:47.307
Why do they get to decide
how we live or die?

21:47.349 --> 21:48.975
- Because the Elements will it.

21:49.017 --> 21:52.145
Now, you will stand down and
come with us to face Tribunal.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.313
- Fuck you.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.080
- This is why they sent us?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.293
- They sent us to
relocate the stragglers.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.087
They sent me to bring
in Sasha Tanner.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.713
- Why didn't you tell me?

22:18.755 --> 22:21.299
- I knew you wouldn't like it.
- You're damn right.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.468
Those stragglers
aren't just here

22:23.510 --> 22:25.345
out of respect for Kieran.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.014
They stayed because
Sasha's the only one

22:28.056 --> 22:29.933
who gave a shit about them

22:29.974 --> 22:31.559
after the Council
took their Guardians.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.229
She is a fucking--

22:34.270 --> 22:35.980
[whooshing]
[groans]

22:36.022 --> 22:37.565
- Rose, what's wrong?

22:39.109 --> 22:41.486
- [panting]
- [growls]

22:42.112 --> 22:43.446
- It's Lissa.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.281
- [growling]
- Secure the perimeter!

22:45.323 --> 22:46.366
- Other side!

22:46.408 --> 22:49.411
- [grunts]
- [snarling]

22:49.452 --> 22:51.121
- Meredith, no!

22:52.330 --> 22:53.915
- [growling]

22:53.957 --> 22:55.458
- [gasps]

22:56.126 --> 22:57.085
- Call for backup!

22:57.127 --> 22:58.503
- [snarling]

22:59.796 --> 23:01.381
- Eddie!

23:05.635 --> 23:07.012
- There's too many!

23:07.053 --> 23:08.888
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Stay calm, Jesse.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.475
- Ahh!

23:12.517 --> 23:14.394
- Meredith, watch out!

23:16.187 --> 23:19.399
- [straining effort]
[sickening ripping]

23:19.441 --> 23:20.984
[growls]

23:23.194 --> 23:24.821
- No, Jesse! No, no!

23:29.451 --> 23:30.827
- Jesse!

23:30.869 --> 23:33.413
- [screams]

23:35.331 --> 23:37.083
- Stay back!

23:40.503 --> 23:42.380
- No, no!
Meredith!

23:42.422 --> 23:45.258
[growling]

23:45.300 --> 23:47.635
[footsteps approaching]

23:48.386 --> 23:50.221
[growling]

23:50.263 --> 23:52.349
- [gasping]

23:52.390 --> 23:53.391
- Meredith!

23:53.433 --> 23:55.143
Meredith, can you hear me?

23:55.185 --> 23:57.020
- Someone call an ambulance.
[shouting]

23:57.062 --> 23:58.855
- Go after them, you two.
- Check the rear.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.398
- Get the Royals out of here!

24:00.440 --> 24:01.983
[whooshing]
- No! No, no, no!

24:02.025 --> 24:03.568
No, no, please, wait!
Give me a second!

24:03.610 --> 24:05.528
Please! Please!
Wait, no!

24:05.570 --> 24:06.905
- Is that all of them?

24:06.946 --> 24:08.865
- It slashed
the shit out of her.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.658
- Okay, get them outta here.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.577
- Let's go, yeah.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.502
[liquid splashing]

24:20.543 --> 24:22.337
- Okay, good.

24:22.379 --> 24:23.505
Yeah, good, Mia.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.924
Now, pull it back.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.885
Mia, pull it back.
- Yeah, I got it.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.470
- Yeah, but you have
to pull it back.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.222
Mia, Mia, it's gonna--
Mia!

24:32.263 --> 24:34.140
- [yelps] Ohh.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.020
- Not bad.
- You see, this is exactly

24:39.062 --> 24:41.439
what happened with Jesse.

24:41.481 --> 24:45.151
It's like it just
ran away from me.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.739
- Come on.
Let's sit down.

24:56.413 --> 24:58.081
- Thanks.

24:58.123 --> 24:59.833
- Wow.

24:59.874 --> 25:02.293
Don't think I've ever heard
you say that word before.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.378
- I'm not that bad.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.130
- [chuckles]

25:05.171 --> 25:07.173
- Or I don't mean to be.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.801
- Magic can be scary.

25:11.136 --> 25:14.222
Thing is, all you got to
do is learn how to control it

25:14.264 --> 25:15.974
so it doesn't control you.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.144
- How long have you
been practicing?

25:19.185 --> 25:22.480
- After my parents...

25:22.522 --> 25:24.149
you know.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.276
my Aunt Tasha
came to stay with me,

25:26.317 --> 25:28.570
and she taught me everything,

25:28.611 --> 25:30.989
even though it was taboo.

25:31.031 --> 25:33.241
It's how I--

25:35.994 --> 25:38.163
It's how I got through
the worst of it.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.792
[chuckles]

25:46.129 --> 25:51.217
- Christian, I know about
St. Jude's and your parents.

25:53.845 --> 25:56.765
My dad's special
advisor to the Queen.

25:56.806 --> 26:00.143
I hear a lot of things
I wish I hadn't.

26:04.189 --> 26:07.650
I just wanted you to know
that, in case you ever

26:07.692 --> 26:11.529
wanted to, you know, talk.

26:28.505 --> 26:29.964
- Hey.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.675
Hey!

26:31.716 --> 26:33.760
- You could have
gotten us all killed.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.762
- How's that on me, huh?

26:35.804 --> 26:37.263
It was the Guardians' job
to protect--

26:37.305 --> 26:40.016
- You didn't have to leave
the party before the convoy.

26:40.058 --> 26:42.644
Do you ever get tired of
being such a selfish prick?

26:42.686 --> 26:43.895
- I've heard enough of this.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.563
We need to start
the wedding rituals.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.023
What am I gonna tell my dad?

26:47.065 --> 26:48.566
- I don't have time for this.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.694
- Make fucking time.

26:50.735 --> 26:53.697
[tense music]

26:53.738 --> 26:54.989
* *

26:55.031 --> 26:56.282
- What?

26:56.324 --> 26:59.703
Is this you trying to
be a man for your father?

26:59.744 --> 27:01.830
You're neither, you know that?

27:05.375 --> 27:06.876
Now get out of my way

27:06.918 --> 27:09.921
and get out of my sight.
[whooshing]

27:11.881 --> 27:18.263
* *

27:18.304 --> 27:20.557
From Lord Zeklos?

27:20.598 --> 27:22.892
Thank you.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.273
[panting]

27:30.859 --> 27:33.528
- That's my girl.

27:33.570 --> 27:36.114
Now, go get it done.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.127
- I'm so sorry.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.922
He was--

27:57.135 --> 27:58.636
He was my friend.

28:05.810 --> 28:09.147
Is that to scare off
the Strigoi?

28:09.189 --> 28:11.358
- They'll come tonight to feed.

28:13.485 --> 28:16.321
This isn't for them.

28:20.033 --> 28:23.870
This is for my
father's funeral pyre.

28:23.912 --> 28:26.414
The doctor said he won't
make it through the night.

28:26.456 --> 28:29.000
- Then you should be
in there, with him.

28:29.042 --> 28:31.252
Not out here, fighting.

28:33.254 --> 28:35.590
Let me take your place
out here tonight.

28:35.632 --> 28:38.760
I'll keep watch for you.

28:38.802 --> 28:40.679
Please.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.855
- Rose.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.691
Guardian HQ
says Lissa is fine.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.025
- I know.

28:56.528 --> 28:57.987
- We need to get moving.

28:58.029 --> 29:01.199
- I'm not going anywhere,
and neither are they.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.329
- We're risking lives
if we stay.

29:06.371 --> 29:09.916
- It's their lives to risk,
to give Kieran peace.

29:09.958 --> 29:13.169
You don't want to talk
to me anymore, fine.

29:13.211 --> 29:15.380
Do your duty.
Be the good soldier.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.507
But I'm done following
the orders of people

29:17.549 --> 29:19.634
who don't put me first.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.469
- [chuckles]

29:21.511 --> 29:26.307
Of course I want to put
you first, but I can't.

29:26.349 --> 29:29.102
Guardians follow orders, Rose,
or the system crumbles.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.563
- The system is broken.

29:31.604 --> 29:35.400
Look at what ignoring the
rules did for Mikhail's family.

29:35.442 --> 29:37.527
Can you imagine
what our lives would be like

29:37.569 --> 29:40.822

who actually cared about us?

nothing about mine.

29:42.490 --> 29:45.118
Mason is better off
knowing nothing about his.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.746
- I know too much
about my father.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.914
I want to be nothing like him.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.958
With no rules,
I'm afraid I would be.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.377
I have to follow orders.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.963
- I don't.

And if you don't like it,
you can take me in

29:58.882 --> 30:01.134
right alongside Sasha.

30:04.095 --> 30:06.598
- How were you not expelled?

30:06.639 --> 30:08.767
- They wanted to
keep things quiet.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.477
Some investigation
they're doing,

30:10.518 --> 30:12.520

my parents snuck the boxes

30:12.562 --> 30:14.147
into my room to begin with.

30:14.189 --> 30:16.816
- And Lissa doesn't
know about any of this?

30:19.861 --> 30:21.196
- Some of it.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.906
I mean, there's no point
telling her now

30:22.947 --> 30:26.493
that she's off getting engaged.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.828

handling that well.

swirling around in here.

questions for my parents,

30:41.925 --> 30:45.053
which you must think is crazy.

30:45.095 --> 30:47.055
- No, I kinda get it.

I tried to find my birth
parents a few years ago.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.688
why they left me as a baby.

But then my birth parents
weren't...

they just wanted--

Be a happy Strigoi
family with you?

Something's happened
to Meredith.

You okay?

Yeah, Jesse told them
I used my magic against him.

I'll kill him

I was honored.

collect.

35:24.124 --> 35:25.500
- Mm.
- Which I love.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.961

why I keep it well preserved,

could give you new insight

35:38.346 --> 35:40.140

35:40.181 --> 35:42.642

You see, I do

- Okay. So then what does
this painting depict?

No, he was a great Guardian.

43:55.176 --> 43:56.594
- Where's Sasha?

44:00.181 --> 44:01.933
What did you do?

44:03.560 --> 44:05.812
- I told her to run.

44:05.854 --> 44:08.773
- For fuck's sake, Rose.
Now she's AWOL.

44:08.815 --> 44:10.191
Do you have any
idea what they'll do to her

44:10.233 --> 44:11.651
if they find her?

44:11.693 --> 44:13.319
What they'll do to you if
they find out that you helped?

44:13.361 --> 44:15.363
- I'm not sorry.

44:15.405 --> 44:17.365
- You never are.

44:18.199 --> 44:21.411
- We risk our lives
to keep lowly little shits

44:21.453 --> 44:23.747
like that alive.

44:23.788 --> 44:26.249
Sasha shouldn't be punished
for speaking the truth

44:26.291 --> 44:29.461
or for wanting
something for herself.

44:29.502 --> 44:31.546
She deserves better.

44:35.175 --> 44:37.260
We all do.

44:37.302 --> 44:44.225
* *

44:46.311 --> 44:48.063
- You ready to move?

44:54.069 --> 44:57.739
[pop music playing
in background]

45:01.910 --> 45:05.580
- I know it wasn't the
answer you were hoping for,

45:05.622 --> 45:08.208
but I may still be
able to help you.

45:08.249 --> 45:09.918
- You don't get it.

45:09.959 --> 45:12.879
This is about more than
just a bunch of paintings.

45:14.673 --> 45:17.842
- I get more than
you think, Lissa.

45:17.884 --> 45:20.929
And I can help you.

45:20.970 --> 45:24.432
But only if you come back.

45:24.474 --> 45:25.975
- Back from where?

45:26.017 --> 45:27.936
- Wake up!

45:34.818 --> 45:36.111
Sorry to wake you.

45:38.279 --> 45:40.699
- You Dream Walked.

45:42.450 --> 45:46.204
You're a Spirit User, like me.

45:48.039 --> 45:50.166
- You up for an adventure?

45:50.208 --> 45:53.086
Get some of those answers
that you want.

45:55.255 --> 45:57.340
- Where's Guardian Tanner?
- Sir, if I may--

45:57.382 --> 45:59.175
- No, you may not, Novice.

46:00.552 --> 46:03.930
I apologize for
the late debrief.

46:03.972 --> 46:08.268
Guardian Tanner died doing
her duty in a Strigoi attack.

46:08.309 --> 46:10.979
You can pay your respects
at the funeral pyre.

46:14.566 --> 46:15.942
- Here, grab that one, too.

46:20.405 --> 46:21.823
- There you are.

46:26.911 --> 46:28.663
- Let's keep it going.

46:31.750 --> 46:35.211
- Why?

46:35.253 --> 46:38.631
- [inhales]

46:38.673 --> 46:40.800
[engine starts]

46:42.677 --> 46:44.596
- We should get moving.

46:44.637 --> 46:47.140
- Not yet.

46:47.182 --> 46:49.351
There's something
you need to do first.

46:50.185 --> 46:53.980
- * I feel like
we're getting close *

46:54.022 --> 46:58.276
* Closer than closer, ooh *

46:58.318 --> 47:02.530
* I can feel another dose *

47:02.572 --> 47:06.409
* You're getting over *

47:06.451 --> 47:09.162
both: [non-English speech]

47:09.204 --> 47:12.082
- * Cut, cut, cut so deep *

47:12.123 --> 47:14.709
* Like a knife, ah, ah, ah *

47:14.751 --> 47:17.796
* I can see on my *

47:17.837 --> 47:22.384
* I, I, I can't breathe
all nice *

47:22.425 --> 47:25.637
* I *

47:25.679 --> 47:29.182
* *

47:29.224 --> 47:34.771
* Feel the fire burning *

47:34.813 --> 47:37.774
* Ahh *

47:37.816 --> 47:44.948
* *

47:54.082 --> 47:59.045
* The anticipation *

47:59.087 --> 48:03.466
* It can't keep me waiting *

48:03.508 --> 48:10.598
* You've got me chasin'
this high *

48:10.974 --> 48:15.270
* Ahh *

48:15.311 --> 48:18.106
* *

48:18.148 --> 48:23.820
* Ahh, ahh *

48:23.862 --> 48:26.781
* *

48:29.617 --> 48:36.499
* *

49:24.422 --> 49:25.507
[dog barks]
