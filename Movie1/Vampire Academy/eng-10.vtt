WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:13.596
<i>* â™ª</i>

00:13.596 --> 00:17.183
Victor lied
about his health

00:17.183 --> 00:18.601
<i>and his Strigoi daughter.</i>

00:18.601 --> 00:21.479
Call upon me,
and I shall serve.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.482
Sonya healed me
because she believed in me.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.734
You don't get to play
the loving husband

00:25.734 --> 00:27.193
and father now.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.653
<i>I know I need
to get my quorum back,</i>

00:28.653 --> 00:30.363
<i>to marry,
and to learn,</i>

00:30.363 --> 00:31.865
and all of that
will take time,

00:31.865 --> 00:34.367
but I have a proposal for you.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.704
<i>I hereby declare
Vasilissa Dragomir</i>

00:37.704 --> 00:39.497
<i>heir to the throne.</i>

00:39.497 --> 00:41.833
Guardian Belikov,
you are under arrest.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.585
<i>I'm the one
that helped Sasha escape.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:46.296
<i>The punishment for treason
is very serious.</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:47.339
I'm leaving.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.757
I need to figure out

00:48.757 --> 00:50.925
<i>who I am outside of you.</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:52.677
- This isn't goodbye.
- No.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.429
It's just see you later.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.223
I thought somewhere inside,
you must still love me.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.433
We came here to feed.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.316
I'm done playing nice.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.777
Now we're doing things
my way, Andre.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.867
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:18.661 --> 01:20.747
This is
what you've been training for.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.915
Be brave.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.376
Show them no mercy,

01:24.376 --> 01:26.086
for you will receive none.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.837
Hurry! Hurry, run!

01:27.837 --> 01:29.714
Come on! Keep moving!
Come on! This way!

01:37.180 --> 01:38.556
Get out!

01:38.556 --> 01:41.101
Keep moving!
Go, go!

01:41.101 --> 01:42.602
Where are we supposed to go?

01:42.602 --> 01:45.438
- Hold my hand!
- I don't want to die!

01:45.438 --> 01:47.399
- Out of the way!
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:47.399 --> 01:50.360
- Miss!
- Close the door!

01:50.360 --> 01:52.445
<i>Lady Dragomir, we need
to get you and the queen</i>

01:52.445 --> 01:54.364
<i>to a defensible location now.</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:19.889
- Go.
- But you're hurt.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.518
Go!

02:58.678 --> 03:01.431
<i>Evacuation zone protocol
is in place.</i>

03:01.431 --> 03:02.932
<i>See Guardians
for instructions.</i>

03:02.932 --> 03:04.184
This is insane.
There aren't enough buses.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.685
Just stay with me.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.687
Hey, wait. Where do you
think you're going?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.689
You guys can't leave
without resealing the wards.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.899
- Can't do it.
- Of course you can.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.525
I've seen how.
I've seen the stake.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.610
The stake is missing.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.862
Without it,
we can't seal the wards.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.864
Get out while you can,
both of you.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.454
I did this.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.872
This is all my fault.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.874
It's not your fault
your parents are terrible.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.958
Parents suck.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.210
Come on, this one.
Hey!

03:30.210 --> 03:31.961
- This one.
- No, I need to be on that bus.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.505
Non-Royals in the next wave.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.547
We're sticking
with that distinction

03:34.547 --> 03:35.799
even during a fucking invasion?

03:35.799 --> 03:37.509
After the Royals
are evacuated,

03:37.509 --> 03:38.885
the buses will return.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.887
Now, step aside.
- She can just have my place!

03:40.887 --> 03:41.930
I said move on!

03:43.682 --> 03:45.475
You should be on that bus.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.559
Me?
I'm going to the archives.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.186
The archives,
in a tunnel

03:48.186 --> 03:49.729
where there could be
any number of Strigoi hiding?

03:49.729 --> 03:50.814
Well, the sun's
gonna come out soon

03:50.814 --> 03:52.148
and we'll be safe
during the day,

03:52.148 --> 03:54.150
but if we don't seal the wards
by tomorrow night,

03:54.150 --> 03:55.527
we're done.

03:58.822 --> 03:59.864
Mia!

04:02.283 --> 04:03.660
I've been looking
all over for you.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.373
Can you ever forgive me?

04:08.373 --> 04:10.625
I'm not the one
that you should be asking.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.379
Mia.
Mia, please.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.464
Mia.
Mia, wait!

04:18.258 --> 04:19.592
Mia!

04:21.761 --> 04:23.596
- What the fuck?
- It's true.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.599
One of the Queen's drivers
owed me money from a bet,

04:26.599 --> 04:28.852
so I got
driving lessons instead.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.061
And the car?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.604
The guy owed money
all over the Dominion,

04:31.604 --> 04:35.025
so I bought his paper
in exchange for this baby.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.903
You're a real mastermind.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.031
Ooh, maybe we should go
to Las Vegas.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.116
- Burn it up.
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.039
I wonder if I can
sense Lissa from there.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.168
Are you now?

04:53.168 --> 04:55.170
Mm...

04:55.170 --> 04:57.797
Just that something's up.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.551
And everything in me
wants to race back, but...

05:01.551 --> 05:04.596
she can take care
of herself now, right?

05:05.972 --> 05:09.517
And she has Dimitri anyhow, so...

05:14.147 --> 05:15.106
Well, not exactly.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.569
You should be on a bus,
not hunkering here with me.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.655
This is my place,
especially now.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.742
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.118
No.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.996
I remember discussing
the protocol for evacuation

05:29.996 --> 05:32.540
with your brother
when he became heir.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.793
I never thought
it would actually happen.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.836
Your feeder, Your Majesty.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.632
How can you be so calm?

05:40.632 --> 05:43.134
Victor won the trials,

05:43.134 --> 05:46.137
saying a good ruler
must give up everything

05:46.137 --> 05:47.972
for their subjects.

05:47.972 --> 05:52.102
Sometimes it means
ignoring your own fear.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.075
Something special?

06:09.119 --> 06:11.329
It's from Christian.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.707
After all
the marriage stuff, he...

06:15.834 --> 06:16.793
I'm sorry.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.087
Right now
is not the time to dwell.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.469
I find
the Marriage Marking Ceremony

06:26.469 --> 06:29.097
quite beautiful.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.265
You?

06:30.265 --> 06:33.101
I didn't think I would...

06:33.101 --> 06:34.519
but yes.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.063
There are such things
as happy surprises,

06:37.063 --> 06:38.815
and there's always hope.

06:38.815 --> 06:42.736
And sometimes the only thing
a good monarch has

06:42.736 --> 06:46.573
is the ability
to project that belief

06:46.573 --> 06:48.908
even when all you want to do
is weep.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.456
I think it's getting lighter.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.125
And in daylight,

06:57.125 --> 06:59.919
the Guardians
will regain control.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.257
You see, hope is nigh.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.638
She's dead, Your Majesty.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.060
I'm suddenly
so terribly cold.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.730
It looks like poison.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.385
<i>- From the moment I arrived
in the Dominion,</i>

07:48.385 --> 07:51.680
<i>I liked you, Andre.</i>

07:53.598 --> 07:56.685
<i>When I ordered the Ozeras
to attack your limo,</i>

07:56.685 --> 07:58.520
<i>you were my target.</i>

07:58.520 --> 08:01.064
I plan to be queen,
and you're going to help me.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.566
- I would die first.
- Then Lissa will be second.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.860
It's entirely your choice.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.488
Without me,
there's no obvious next heir.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.032
Victor Dashkov is a follower,
not a leader,

08:11.032 --> 08:12.534
but he'll never
support a stranger.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.703
That's why I plan to appeal
to the High Priestess

08:14.703 --> 08:16.538
and the Elementalists.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.206
I'll put on a show of faith,

08:18.206 --> 08:20.709
instill fear,
play up the Strigoi threat,

08:20.709 --> 08:24.504
then insist I'm the only one
who can keep them safe.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.299
Is there any legal impediment
you know of to me being queen?

08:28.299 --> 08:29.426
Not as a Vogel.

08:31.803 --> 08:32.929
There's an arcane decree

08:32.929 --> 08:35.849
that requires the heir
to have a quorum,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.475
but the Vogels
are a large family.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.768
You should be fine.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.562
<i>You couldn't know
your advice would lead</i>

08:40.562 --> 08:43.231
<i>to the attack on St. Jude's</i>

08:43.231 --> 08:45.108
<i>and cheat Lissa out
of the crown.</i>

08:45.108 --> 08:48.153
Without a quorum,
you cannot sit on the throne.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.697
<i>All in all,
you've been very helpful.</i>

08:50.697 --> 08:53.908
<i>All building interiors need
to be evacuated immediately.</i>

08:53.908 --> 08:55.827
<i>It is not safe to remain.</i>

08:55.827 --> 08:57.245
I have one question.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.081
What's the emergency protocol
for succession?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.125
Do all heads of family
need to vote?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.294
By all, you mean...

09:05.337 --> 09:06.963
Let me put him out
of his misery.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.591
Mm-mm-mm.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.301
Not until I say.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.098
You'll still need me.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.975
Ruling a divided Dominion
won't be easy.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.810
They can fight all they want.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.354
I won't be queen for long.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.735
You've only ever talked
about getting the throne,

09:28.735 --> 09:29.986
never ruling.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.323
You don't want to be queen.
What do you want?

09:33.323 --> 09:34.824
I want you
to shut your mouth.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.623
You'll leave him alone
until I say.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.125
If, in an emergency session...

09:44.125 --> 09:45.585
You move like a Dhampir.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.837
It's not possible for all
Council members to vote...

09:47.837 --> 09:49.172
The vote
should be rescheduled.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.966
Darling...

09:51.966 --> 09:53.343
you've known me long enough.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.097
Lissa's fair game if
you don't give me what I want.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.350
Answer me.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.064
In the event
of the absence...

10:08.316 --> 10:09.859
Or death

10:09.859 --> 10:12.529
of one or more
of the Council members...

10:14.614 --> 10:17.242
The remaining members can agree
to call for a vote.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.166
<i>Strigoi are hiding
in buildings.</i>

10:25.166 --> 10:27.043
<i>You're safer outside
until sundown.</i>

10:27.043 --> 10:29.170
This is a shitshow.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.172
I thought
you'd be miles away by now.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.549
I was worried about Lissa.
Where is she?

10:32.549 --> 10:34.009
She's fine.
She's with the Queen.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.343
She's under protection.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.388
Are all these people
waiting to be evacuated?

10:38.388 --> 10:40.890
The Royals got
the first buses out.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.393
Cover up!
You're safer in the sun.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.067
We just got news
that the buses arrived

10:51.067 --> 10:53.194
at their destinations,

10:53.194 --> 10:54.571
but they're idling
at the tarmac.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.156
Apparently some of the Royals
aren't comfortable

10:56.156 --> 10:58.283
walking 30 fucking feet
in the sun to the plane.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.284
They're waiting till dusk.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.036
They're not coming back?

11:01.036 --> 11:02.495
I know they'd do this
to Dhampirs,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.664
but they're not coming back
for Moroi?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.375
Our only option is to stay
and protect them here.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.878
Like fish in a barrel.
It's suicide.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.671
And what do you
suggest, Rose?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.423
If you know of another way,
we'd all love to hear it.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.261
Actually, there is.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.390
I mean, there might be a way.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.725
There's...

11:23.725 --> 11:25.643
a tunnel.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.729
No one ever uses it.

11:27.729 --> 11:28.980
Goes almost to the tarmac.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.113
Christian reads
those old books.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.907
I read maps, okay?
- Yeah, so do I.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.076
And it's not on any
I've ever seen.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.243
What the fuck, Meredith?

11:42.243 --> 11:43.328
Well, obviously
it's gonna have

11:43.328 --> 11:44.704
to be cleared first because...

11:44.704 --> 11:46.456
It's the perfect place
for Strigoi to hide

11:46.456 --> 11:47.290
during the day.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.917
That's a suicide mission.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.085
Not if you happen to know

11:50.085 --> 11:51.961
when they might be coming
around the bend.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.257
All right.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.550
Who's coming with me?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.307
It should be Dimitri.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.017
He has more experience.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.978
I'll go up top
and cover the entrance.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.279
Be safe, Rose.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.661
Let's go.
Come on.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.081
Good luck.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.815
Okay.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.150
That was impressive...

12:55.150 --> 12:57.819
and kind of disgusting.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.446
And this place is off-limits.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.073
I know, but I heard you lost
a stake that opens the wards.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.203
In the 15th century,
Saint Vladimir himself

13:07.203 --> 13:09.831
made one unique
to each province.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.042
I would not lose such
an object; it was stolen.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.335
Go find a bus.
- No.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.377
We have to defend this place.
- By tonight,

13:14.377 --> 13:16.546
there won't be a province
to defend.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.632
- Not if we make a new stake.
- It's impossible.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.718
We have tried.
- With what? How?

13:23.386 --> 13:25.805
Look, maybe I can help.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.184
Can you at least tell me
how it's made?

13:29.184 --> 13:31.061
Oh, so you can tell
your Strigoi mother?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.818
So I can make up
for what my parents did.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.697
And how would you know
anything we don't?

13:42.697 --> 13:43.615
Because I read...

13:44.908 --> 13:47.243
Stuff that you would
excommunicate me for.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.875
<i>We repeat,
avoid all covered corridors</i>

13:53.875 --> 13:55.210
<i>void of any light.</i>

13:55.210 --> 13:57.003
<i>Follow the Guardians...</i>

13:59.714 --> 14:03.259
It's heresy, you know,
to murder a queen.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.722
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
Your doctor is missing.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.933
And the Royals
took theirs with them.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.101
There are no doctors anywhere.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.435
But there has to be.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.146
Thank you, Guardian.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.412
Your hand feels so warm.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.083
And you are so strong.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.210
You'll be fine.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.631
One of a queen's duties
is to face reality.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.051
Though I should be fading fast,

14:45.051 --> 14:46.511
it will come.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.889
No, I won't lose you too.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.976
How I wish that were true.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.861
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.029
I wouldn't leave you,

15:04.029 --> 15:05.155
but there are
Strigoi mobilizing

15:05.155 --> 15:06.281
in the shadows
of the castle.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.449
They need us at the entrance.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.784
Of course they do, Felix.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.494
You're one of our best.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.331
It's been an honor,
Your Majesty.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.543
For us both.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.807
- Stay still.
- Oh!

15:32.807 --> 15:35.018
You going all tough girl again
now that she's gone?

15:37.979 --> 15:39.814
Ah, yeah.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.359
I'd be cranky too if I
just had my ass handed to me.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.363
Ah-ah-ah.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.157
You're not supposed
to kill me yet.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.208
Ow.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.451
It's not safe.
They're getting closer.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.619
We need to leave.

16:34.619 --> 16:35.912
Not we.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.247
You.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.582
They weren't just after me, Vasilissa.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.170
Take her cape.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.718
In your marriage preparations,

16:49.718 --> 16:52.053
did you ever
give Christian a gift?

16:52.053 --> 16:54.723
A Dragomir necklace.
Why?

16:54.723 --> 16:56.891
Then you have completed
the three marriage rituals.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.185
No, Christian never
actually gave me his gift.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.520
Didn't he?

17:03.481 --> 17:06.401
In the eyes of the church,
you are married.

17:06.401 --> 17:10.196
In the eyes of the state,
you have your quorum.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.741
The Council could
vote you queen this day.

17:12.741 --> 17:14.576
But I need more time
to learn from you.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.244
I'm--I'm not ready to be queen.

17:16.244 --> 17:17.954
No one ever is.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.332
But remember,

17:21.332 --> 17:23.043
you're a Dragomir.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.962
Now, go!

17:25.962 --> 17:28.214
I'll cover you.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.468
One last blast of air power
to show them what's what.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.387
I'll never forget you.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.681
I bloody well hope not.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.100
Go!

17:39.100 --> 17:40.852
Okay.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.375
Mason and his team
will guard the entrance.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.086
Another crew of Guardians
will meet you at the other end.

18:48.086 --> 18:51.047
Once it's clear, we'll start
the second wave of evacuations,

18:51.047 --> 18:53.425
if there's anyone left
to evacuate.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.051
- Meredith--
- Please don't ask me again

18:55.051 --> 18:57.095
how I know about this tunnel.
- I'm not.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.765
I just want to say
that Mia will be fine.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.520
If you don't clear
those tunnels before sunset,

19:05.520 --> 19:07.063
no one else will.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.075
Okay.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.411
"The stakes were anointed
by the Blood of the Four

19:21.411 --> 19:23.830
and imbued by the Paraclete."

19:23.830 --> 19:24.873
A helper,

19:24.873 --> 19:27.000
presumably
Saint Vladimir himself.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.418
Okay, but imbued?

19:28.418 --> 19:29.586
It's a tricky word.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.421
We tried
to replicate the stakes

19:31.421 --> 19:32.922
with blood from Moroi

19:32.922 --> 19:35.592
who specialize
in each of the Four Elements,

19:35.592 --> 19:38.636
then added the blood
of the monk making them.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.930
We even tried with
Saint Vladimir's own blood,

19:40.930 --> 19:43.683
wasting the little we had
with no success.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.853
Wait, what--

19:46.853 --> 19:49.022
what if Vladimir used
something other than blood,

19:49.022 --> 19:51.191
something... rarer?

19:52.734 --> 19:54.402
I think your stakes
aren't working

19:54.402 --> 19:56.738
because the original stakes
were imbued by Vladimir

19:56.738 --> 19:58.156
but not with blood.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.284
He was a Spirit User.

20:01.284 --> 20:04.162
I think he imbued
the stakes with Spirit...

20:05.789 --> 20:06.956
The Fifth Element.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.375
What you are saying
is blasphemy.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.668
And if I'm right,

20:09.668 --> 20:12.212
it would save
a lot of innocent lives.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.507
Why did you read these books?

20:17.217 --> 20:18.927
To understand
what my parents did.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.304
There are no excuses
for that.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.639
- Yeah.
- But...

20:22.639 --> 20:26.601
it is not easy to accept
that for some things,

20:26.601 --> 20:28.937
there are no answers.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.983
Your father was sick.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.319
Your parents
came to me for counsel

20:36.319 --> 20:38.863
when they knew that...

20:38.863 --> 20:40.281
death would part them.

20:43.368 --> 20:44.828
I didn't know he was sick.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.621
They must have wanted
to spare you.

20:48.289 --> 20:52.335
And I suppose the lure
of being together forever

20:52.335 --> 20:54.129
was too much.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.383
It was wrong,

20:58.383 --> 21:01.803
but they weren't the only ones
ever to make that choice.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.195
You can start with my blood.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.572
I'm Air.

21:22.073 --> 21:25.035
Only a monk can wield a blade
of this nature.

21:28.913 --> 21:32.876
And how does one
become a monk?

21:32.876 --> 21:35.712
In this Dominion,

21:35.712 --> 21:38.715
a Moroi is a monk

21:38.715 --> 21:40.425
when I say they are.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.633
Lissa?

22:21.633 --> 22:24.552
Wait, what happened?

22:24.552 --> 22:28.098
I was hiding in the cistern
with a bunch of students.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.432
And there was a Strigoi attack,

22:29.432 --> 22:30.934
and then a stampede,

22:30.934 --> 22:32.227
and some fucking idiot
crushed my foot.

22:32.227 --> 22:35.271
- Okay, well, I can--
- No, no, no.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.731
No healing.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.734
Hey, no crying either.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.819
If you start, I'll start,

22:40.819 --> 22:41.820
and I don't think
I'll ever stop.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.072
Mia, they poisoned the Queen.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.867
I tried to heal her,
but it's not like a wound.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.203
I wanted to,
but I couldn't cure her.

22:51.621 --> 22:52.789
And she said
they're after me too.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.040
Then you can't stay here.

22:55.917 --> 22:56.960
You need to take that off.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.128
You're a big enough target
as it is.

22:58.128 --> 22:59.462
We need to get you
to another province

22:59.462 --> 23:00.797
until the wards are back up.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.633
I don't see how
without any buses.

23:03.633 --> 23:04.843
No, I know.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.304
I think I have an idea.
Come on.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.640
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.891
- Okay.
- Let's go.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.977
You could've been miles away
by now.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.353
Wondering where you were.

23:18.773 --> 23:19.983
Where do you even live?

23:19.983 --> 23:21.735
Between here
and The Shambles,

23:21.735 --> 23:22.944
I get by.

23:26.197 --> 23:29.159
What's this from?

23:29.159 --> 23:31.703
A love letter from my father.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.163
What's he got against you?

23:40.754 --> 23:43.006
Now and then, I...

23:45.425 --> 23:46.968
I leave the wards...

23:48.636 --> 23:50.430
And I find some human.

23:53.183 --> 23:56.353
And I bite,

23:56.353 --> 23:59.397
and I feed...

23:59.397 --> 24:02.400
as much as I want
and in the way that I want.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.199
And I don't stop until...

24:11.868 --> 24:14.746
Until just before they die.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.752
That's the only thing
that's really--

24:22.754 --> 24:25.757
That really separates me
from a Strigoi.

24:27.425 --> 24:30.136
I've tried to stop,
but I can't.

24:36.434 --> 24:38.812
What do you think
those are for?

24:40.689 --> 24:42.232
Not polite feeding rooms

24:42.232 --> 24:44.401
and dabbing blood
with a hankie.

24:46.653 --> 24:50.990
The Moroi spend their lives
repressing themselves,

24:50.990 --> 24:53.827
and then they feel the need
to repress everyone else.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.456
You're not in the wrong.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.125
They are.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.757
It's not safe
for you to stay.

25:07.757 --> 25:09.718
Then let's get out of here.

25:09.718 --> 25:10.760
Both of us?

25:35.410 --> 25:36.327
What are these?

25:41.750 --> 25:43.084
Alchemist symbols.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.630
Alchemists?

25:47.630 --> 25:50.008
Per the human treaty,

25:50.008 --> 25:52.886
it's their job to keep us
a secret in the human world

25:52.886 --> 25:54.804
and to provide the Moroi
with feeders.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.639
How have I
never heard of them?

25:56.639 --> 25:58.808
Only heads of families
and upper-level Guardians

25:58.808 --> 26:01.436
know about them.

26:01.436 --> 26:05.315
Alchemists think
Moroi and Dhampirs are evil,

26:05.315 --> 26:07.817
an abomination
against their god.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.736
Then what are they
doing here?

26:09.736 --> 26:12.489
And how the hell did Meredith
know about this place?

26:12.489 --> 26:14.032
I don't know.

26:14.032 --> 26:16.785
But if you ever
see one of these out

26:16.785 --> 26:18.661
in the human world
with Mason,

26:18.661 --> 26:19.871
run.

26:24.959 --> 26:26.336
He's a good guy.

26:30.548 --> 26:31.883
He is.

26:44.562 --> 26:47.190
Why didn't you tell me
you were facing prison?

26:47.190 --> 26:49.192
Why didn't you tell me
you were going AWOL?

26:49.192 --> 26:51.111
And why in the name
of the Saints

26:51.111 --> 26:52.904
did you come back?

26:52.904 --> 26:54.906
You were safe.
- What about Lissa?

26:54.906 --> 26:57.492
If you're in the dungeon,
is she safe?

26:57.492 --> 26:59.202
What happened
to "they come first"?

26:59.202 --> 27:01.246
Don't lecture me about duty.

27:02.455 --> 27:03.707
Really?

27:03.707 --> 27:06.042
Because I've had nothing
but lectures from you

27:06.042 --> 27:07.335
since we first met.

27:07.335 --> 27:08.712
Maybe because
you had a lot to learn.

27:08.712 --> 27:11.464
And maybe because you like
to tell me what to do.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.050
You think you know me
so well, but you--

27:44.080 --> 27:45.081
I do know you.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.124
What's my favorite food?

27:46.124 --> 27:48.585
Anyone knows that.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.211
Pizza.

27:52.255 --> 27:53.548
What's my favorite book?

27:53.548 --> 27:54.924
That's not fair.

27:54.924 --> 27:56.301
You have too many.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.058
The Queen is dead.

28:09.105 --> 28:11.107
The Queen is dead.

28:11.107 --> 28:13.151
The royal census taker
confirmed it.

28:14.986 --> 28:16.613
The Queen is dead.

28:19.157 --> 28:20.200
Long live--

28:20.200 --> 28:21.284
Oh, sod that, Peter.

28:21.284 --> 28:22.494
We need to get out of here.

28:22.494 --> 28:24.579
Do we even have a plan?

28:43.181 --> 28:44.307
Stop that!

28:44.307 --> 28:47.185
Guardians!
We need Guardians!

28:48.687 --> 28:50.939
- Open up!
- Where are the Guardians?

28:50.939 --> 28:52.065
Open that door!

29:06.746 --> 29:08.081
You've got company.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.583
We need your car.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.668
Fuck off.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.044
Jesse.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.840
Fine.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.633
We'll all go.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.021
Okay.

29:31.021 --> 29:32.689
Fuck, Mia.
Pick up the pace.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.691
Don't be
a fucking dick, Jesse.

29:34.691 --> 29:37.402
Thank you, Jesse,
for your profound generosity

29:37.402 --> 29:38.903
during these troubled times.

29:46.244 --> 29:47.495
Jesse.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.040
Finally.
Where the fuck have you been?

29:50.040 --> 29:52.083
- Dad, I--
- Right, Lissa can stay.

29:52.083 --> 29:53.460
The rest of you, get out.

29:53.460 --> 29:55.211
There's room for everyone
if we just move up.

29:55.211 --> 29:56.629
Not her.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.381
It's certain
fucking death out there.

29:58.381 --> 29:59.674
Well, that's her problem,
isn't it?

29:59.674 --> 30:01.551
I'm not getting in
until she gets out.

30:01.551 --> 30:03.511
She's a filthy
fucking blood whore.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.013
You really need to get in.

30:05.013 --> 30:07.223
Oh, don't start with your
pathetic pleas for clemency.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.558
But, Lord Zeklos, please--

30:13.521 --> 30:15.523
Aah!

30:15.523 --> 30:17.233
Jesse!

30:17.233 --> 30:20.195
Son.
- Sorry, no room.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.124
There it is,
up ahead.

30:33.124 --> 30:35.001
What's
"Long Walk to Freedom"?

30:35.001 --> 30:37.170
It's an autobiography,

30:37.170 --> 30:40.006
written by a great human.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.758
You read a lot about them.

30:41.758 --> 30:42.926
I do.

30:42.926 --> 30:44.427
Why?

30:46.429 --> 30:50.392
Even in the worst
possible circumstances,

30:50.392 --> 30:52.686
they seem
to have the ability

30:52.686 --> 30:55.689
to believe
something better is possible.

30:57.732 --> 30:59.442
I envy it.

30:59.442 --> 31:03.446
There is more grace
in that hope

31:03.446 --> 31:05.490
than all the prayers
I've ever uttered.

31:06.991 --> 31:09.285
You can't make a world
you can't envision.

31:11.246 --> 31:13.289
You have that ability.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.129
It's one of the things
that I love--

31:37.981 --> 31:39.399
Get off him!

31:40.900 --> 31:42.193
You'll be okay.

31:42.193 --> 31:44.863
The high will pass.

32:06.176 --> 32:07.719
Look at them.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.513
At sunset, they're all just
sitting ducks to the Strigoi.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.061
Stop the car.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.025
It's not safe.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.570
It's Eddie.

32:25.570 --> 32:27.822
He's wounded.

32:27.822 --> 32:30.575
There are so many people here
who are wounded and scared,

32:30.575 --> 32:32.452
and they can't just
drive out of here.

32:34.162 --> 32:36.581
I'm sorry,
but I can't leave.

32:36.581 --> 32:37.582
Queen Marina didn't.

32:37.582 --> 32:39.084
And look
what happened to her.

32:39.084 --> 32:42.504
This is my place,
especially now.

32:44.589 --> 32:45.632
Thank you, Jesse.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.430
Wait.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.973
Oh, fuck.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.395
What?

32:58.395 --> 33:00.772
I'm not gonna let you
do this alone.

33:00.772 --> 33:01.856
Thanks, Jesse.

33:01.856 --> 33:03.441
You're not always
a complete dick.

33:05.485 --> 33:08.613
Hey, try not
to get yourselves killed.

33:17.205 --> 33:19.124
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

33:55.535 --> 33:58.079
It was an honor to fight
with such a skilled Guardian.

33:59.873 --> 34:01.207
Me too.

34:04.878 --> 34:06.212
Let's go.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.630
I brought backup.

34:07.630 --> 34:09.799
We can start
evacuating the Moroi.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.391
All right, Mia.
It's your turn.

34:59.391 --> 35:01.768
Come on.
- No, you've done too much.

35:01.768 --> 35:04.396
Lissa, what about the Darkness?
- It's okay.

35:04.396 --> 35:08.441
I know now that healing
doesn't fill me with Darkness.

35:08.441 --> 35:10.276
It just takes my light.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.736
Spirit needs light.

35:11.736 --> 35:14.698
But you're still pushing it.
Lissa, you have to rest.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.492
I was taking Rose's.

35:22.622 --> 35:24.499
I saved Rose
in the car accident.

35:26.876 --> 35:29.087
So now we have...

35:29.087 --> 35:30.463
this link.

35:36.344 --> 35:40.473
Like Sonya with
all the birds that she saved?

35:44.185 --> 35:46.187
And I called her the bird lady.

35:48.273 --> 35:50.483
She knew
how much you loved her...

35:52.318 --> 35:54.487
Just like I knew
how much Andre loved me.

35:56.781 --> 35:57.866
I'm glad you know.

36:03.788 --> 36:05.165
I should have known
all this healing

36:05.165 --> 36:06.666
would mean a visit from you.

36:07.917 --> 36:10.211
- Andre.
- Mia.

36:18.178 --> 36:20.513
No, this can't be real.

36:20.513 --> 36:21.598
It is.

36:21.598 --> 36:22.932
Oh, Andre.

36:31.358 --> 36:33.526
I never thought
I would see you again.

36:33.526 --> 36:35.820
I'm here, Lissa.
I'm here.

36:37.697 --> 36:39.449
But how?
Where have you been?

36:39.449 --> 36:41.451
I'll tell you everything
in time.

36:41.451 --> 36:43.995
And I know
what you've been through.

36:43.995 --> 36:45.830
I am so proud of you.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.460
But you have to get out
of the Dominion now.

36:50.460 --> 36:53.088
Tatiana isn't
who she says she is.

36:53.088 --> 36:54.881
It's not safe.

36:54.881 --> 36:57.342
Aah!

36:57.342 --> 36:59.427
No, no, no, no!

37:03.014 --> 37:04.683
Rose!

37:04.683 --> 37:07.560
Aah!

37:09.229 --> 37:11.564
No!

37:11.564 --> 37:12.607
Andre!

37:12.607 --> 37:13.858
No, no!

37:13.858 --> 37:16.152
No, no, Andre!!
Andre, please stay with me!

37:16.152 --> 37:17.404
Stay with me!

37:23.034 --> 37:24.160
No!

37:31.668 --> 37:33.628
No, no!

37:53.857 --> 37:56.609
<i>We have to hold the line
until the wards go back up.</i>

37:56.609 --> 37:58.111
They're just waiting for sunset
to attack.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.696
We can't let them through.

38:07.370 --> 38:08.997
Mia.

38:10.665 --> 38:11.750
The evacuation has begun.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.710
There are teams
leading them through.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.670
At least some will make it
through the night.

38:17.213 --> 38:19.591
Mia, I...

38:25.013 --> 38:28.058
Hey, look,
I know it's a lot to ask,

38:28.058 --> 38:29.559
but if this works,

38:29.559 --> 38:32.103
I go to the ward line,
I use the stake and the pillar,

38:32.103 --> 38:34.189
and we can close the wards.

38:34.189 --> 38:36.191
And if it doesn't,
the Strigoi keep coming.

38:38.651 --> 38:39.986
Will you try?

39:03.718 --> 39:05.970
I want to,

39:05.970 --> 39:09.307
but I just don't think
I have anything left to give.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.230
Lissa!

39:18.525 --> 39:20.735
- Andre, he--
- I know.

39:31.788 --> 39:32.747
They're here.

39:35.792 --> 39:36.835
Fan out.

39:42.882 --> 39:45.051
It's time.
Let's go.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.428
It's now or never, Lissa.

39:52.767 --> 39:55.228
You're not alone.

39:55.228 --> 39:56.604
We can do this together.

40:37.020 --> 40:39.189
Dimitri!

40:39.189 --> 40:40.357
I'll get her somewhere safe.

40:42.192 --> 40:44.486
Christian, I'll cover you.

40:44.486 --> 40:45.487
Go!

41:19.479 --> 41:20.689
Sonya?

41:22.982 --> 41:23.900
It's you.

41:27.112 --> 41:28.863
You know I love you,
don't you?

41:35.537 --> 41:37.414
Can you ever forgive me?

41:56.391 --> 41:57.559
Christian!

42:00.228 --> 42:01.646
Go, go, go!

42:09.195 --> 42:10.780
Meredith, incoming!

43:00.205 --> 43:01.498
No!

43:04.834 --> 43:05.794
Mason.

43:24.979 --> 43:26.106
Whoo!

43:26.106 --> 43:27.982
Mason.

43:27.982 --> 43:30.443
Mason's down!

43:36.282 --> 43:38.410
- Mason.
- Oh, no, no.

43:43.748 --> 43:45.417
We have to get him
to the infirmary.

43:45.417 --> 43:47.168
No, Rose,
you have to find Dimitri

43:47.168 --> 43:49.462
and get Lissa out
of the Dominion.

43:54.801 --> 43:55.760
No--

43:58.138 --> 43:59.848
Mason would understand.

44:18.658 --> 44:23.455
<i>â™ª Love is like a flame â™ª</i>

44:25.832 --> 44:31.338
<i>â™ª That burns out of control â™ª</i>

44:34.674 --> 44:40.430
<i>â™ª It feels so warm â™ª</i>

44:42.390 --> 44:49.272
<i>â™ª But it's a dangerous thing â™ª</i>

44:49.272 --> 44:53.151
This Dominion
was nearly lost.

44:53.151 --> 44:55.945
Today was everything
I've been warning of.

44:55.945 --> 44:58.239
Thankfully I was prepared.

44:58.239 --> 45:00.742
And we are still standing.

45:02.202 --> 45:06.206
Someone asked me why
I worked so hard to be queen,

45:06.206 --> 45:07.916
and the answer is simple.

45:09.417 --> 45:12.045
Why does anyone do anything?

45:15.382 --> 45:17.550
For love.

45:17.550 --> 45:20.804
And so, with the unanimous vote
of the Council...

45:22.847 --> 45:25.266
I consent to be your queen.

45:27.477 --> 45:34.693
<i>â™ª I'm walking on fire â™ª</i>

45:34.693 --> 45:36.778
<i>â™ª I'm dancing in the smoke â™ª</i>

45:36.778 --> 45:38.613
<i>â™ª Running over coal â™ª</i>

45:38.613 --> 45:40.073
<i>â™ª Look into my eyes â™ª</i>

45:40.073 --> 45:42.283
<i>â™ª Baby, I can make them glow â™ª</i>

45:42.283 --> 45:45.370
<i>â™ª I'm walking on fire â™ª</i>

45:45.370 --> 45:48.748
<i>- And a word for all members
of the Dominion.</i>

45:48.748 --> 45:50.542
<i>If anyone knows
the whereabouts</i>

45:50.542 --> 45:52.460
<i>of Vasilissa Dragomir,</i>

45:52.460 --> 45:54.796
she's wanted for questioning

45:54.796 --> 45:57.507
in the assassination
of Queen Marina.

45:57.507 --> 46:03.138
<i>â™ª I'm walking on fire â™ª</i>

46:17.027 --> 46:19.612
Mason is, um...

46:19.612 --> 46:21.114
He's in surgery.

46:47.515 --> 46:49.017
Stay.

47:04.991 --> 47:07.285
Yeah.

47:18.546 --> 47:20.507
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:20.507 --> 47:23.134
Am I going somewhere?

47:23.134 --> 47:25.845
And last time I looked,
I was in a ball gown.

47:25.845 --> 47:28.556
That wasn't me.
That was Rose.

47:30.058 --> 47:31.601
We're getting you out
of the Dominion.

47:31.601 --> 47:33.520
Tatiana's calling you
a person of interest

47:33.520 --> 47:34.771
in the death
of Queen Marina.

47:34.771 --> 47:36.022
No one would actually
think that I--

47:36.022 --> 47:38.525
You were the last one
with her.

47:38.525 --> 47:42.696
Someone poisoned
Queen Marina, and...

47:42.696 --> 47:44.114
now they're coming after you.

47:45.699 --> 47:46.908
Tatiana.

47:48.201 --> 47:50.912
Andre said she wasn't
who she says she is.

47:53.248 --> 47:56.042
He told me
as he handed me this,

47:56.042 --> 47:58.336
but I have no idea what it is.

48:00.422 --> 48:02.799
So...

48:04.342 --> 48:05.552
Where are we going?

48:05.552 --> 48:07.846
I'm not.

48:07.846 --> 48:11.182
My aunt was killed
in the fighting,

48:11.182 --> 48:14.144
which means
I'm the new head of my family.

48:16.896 --> 48:20.567
I know I'll never be able
to make up for all of this.

48:20.567 --> 48:21.693
You don't have to.

48:21.693 --> 48:24.863
Still, I have to try.

48:29.075 --> 48:30.452
Once I go,

48:30.452 --> 48:32.412
I don't know if I'll ever
be free to come back.

48:32.412 --> 48:34.789
I know.

48:34.789 --> 48:37.584
And if we never
see each other again,

48:37.584 --> 48:38.752
I want you to know that--

48:38.752 --> 48:39.961
We're married.

48:41.338 --> 48:42.422
- What?
- Yeah.

48:42.422 --> 48:44.215
Queen Marina said
the primer you gave me

48:44.215 --> 48:47.427
counts as a gift,
and so, according to her,

48:47.427 --> 48:48.345
we're married.

48:49.721 --> 48:51.806
Oh.

48:51.806 --> 48:55.018
Well, according
to High Priestess Irene...

48:57.312 --> 48:58.646
I'm a monk.

48:58.646 --> 49:01.358
It was the only way
I could wield the stake, so...

49:03.026 --> 49:05.445
It's all kind of messy.

49:10.784 --> 49:13.078
You will see me again.

49:13.078 --> 49:14.746
Good.

49:14.746 --> 49:17.332
Because whatever happens...

49:21.294 --> 49:22.837
I love you.

49:24.631 --> 49:26.716
I love you too.

49:30.095 --> 49:32.722
Wait, are monks
allowed to kiss?

49:33.848 --> 49:35.809
Let's live dangerously.

49:39.187 --> 49:42.399
All I'm saying is,
you're not driving.

49:42.399 --> 49:44.776
You don't even know
if I can drive.

49:47.529 --> 49:51.491
The thought of waking up
to you every morning,

49:51.491 --> 49:52.909
that face full of sleep...

50:06.589 --> 50:09.134
Even in the human world,
we were chased down.

50:10.510 --> 50:14.055
There is no out there
or in here for us now.

50:16.558 --> 50:18.727
There's just the world.

50:25.150 --> 50:27.152
None of it's safe for Lissa.

50:31.072 --> 50:33.366
Until Tatiana
is taken down...

50:34.909 --> 50:38.079
And order is restored
in the Dominion.

50:44.127 --> 50:46.963
Protection comes in many forms.

50:50.258 --> 50:52.927
You need to fight
for Lissa here.

51:00.101 --> 51:01.770
It would have been...

51:04.939 --> 51:06.274
Everything.

51:11.613 --> 51:13.031
Rose, I could come.

51:15.325 --> 51:16.826
But then
you'd be someone else.

51:16.826 --> 51:19.287
Maybe someone
you like better.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.753
But someone I'm not.

51:26.753 --> 51:28.088
No.

51:32.258 --> 51:36.096
You are everything I never
wanted to fall in love with.

51:41.559 --> 51:43.019
You too, Roza.

52:11.965 --> 52:13.216
Rose.

52:13.216 --> 52:14.926
I know
what you're going to say.

52:14.926 --> 52:16.928
I have to go.
- Of course you do.

52:18.638 --> 52:21.975
Take care of her,
and take care of yourself.

52:50.211 --> 52:53.757
If you ever need anything
when you're out there,

52:53.757 --> 52:57.052
anything at all,
call this number.

52:58.553 --> 53:00.096
Be safe, love.

53:07.771 --> 53:10.440
Hey.
Who is this?

53:10.440 --> 53:12.067
Your father.

53:22.577 --> 53:25.914
I hope you know
how to drive this thing.

53:25.914 --> 53:28.541
I'm not sure,
but what the hell?

53:28.541 --> 53:30.043
It's worth a shot, right?

53:32.545 --> 53:35.006
This is nothing
like we ever planned

53:35.006 --> 53:36.633
when we talked
about getting out of here.

53:38.551 --> 53:42.263
We're nothing like the
two girls who made those plans.

53:51.606 --> 53:53.566
You ready?

53:53.566 --> 53:55.110
What do you think?

53:58.738 --> 54:00.240
<i>â™ª Ashes to ashes â™ª</i>

54:00.240 --> 54:02.158
<i>â™ª All falls down â™ª</i>

54:04.452 --> 54:07.872
<i>â™ª Sons of the wicked
burned this town â™ª</i>

54:10.250 --> 54:15.880
<i>â™ª Running for light
in this darkness â™ª</i>

54:15.880 --> 54:19.259
<i>â™ª Things will never
be the same â™ª</i>

54:19.259 --> 54:21.511
<i>â™ª Everything we had
in flames â™ª</i>

54:21.511 --> 54:26.558
<i>â™ª Watch the embers burning
behind me â™ª</i>

54:26.558 --> 54:27.600
<i>â™ª Flame â™ª</i>

54:34.441 --> 54:37.694
<i>â™ª I'll see you
on the other side â™ª</i>

54:43.116 --> 54:50.290
<i>* â™ª</i>
