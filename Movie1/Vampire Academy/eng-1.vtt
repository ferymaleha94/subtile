Is it any surprise

14:17.148 --> 14:18.650
Rose would have
certain expectations?

You're able to operate

Now, we need
to discuss your schedule.

The other heads of families

an official head of family.

But in just a few months,
Rose and I are out of here.

Why waste your time teaching me
something I'm never gonna use?

27:56.301 --> 27:57.719

Andre's death changes
everything for you,

It's Royals only.

The queen was very insistent.
- So that's it?

One minute,
I'm the future king's fiancée,

29:33.481 --> 29:36.484

29:36.526 --> 29:37.944
I'm keeping the necklace.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.821
- It's a Dragomir
family heirloom.

29:39.863 --> 29:41.239
- And a Dragomir gave it to me.

29:41.281 --> 29:43.491

in that way,

can be just as powerful.

41:07.342 --> 41:10.053
<i>* You're safe with me,</i>
<i>don't change on me *</i>

41:10.095 --> 41:12.472
<i>* Don't change,</i>
<i>don't change, don't change *</i>

41:12.514 --> 41:15.350
<i>* Been a long road, whoa *</i>

41:15.392 --> 41:19.938
<i>* Yeah, we all souls,</i>
<i>down the same road *</i>

41:19.979 --> 41:23.566
<i>- I think unicorn in Moroi...</i>
<i>is Lissa.</i>

41:23.608 --> 41:26.194
<i>- * Been down</i>
<i>the longest road *</i>

41:26.236 --> 41:29.823
<i>* Oh, whoa *</i>

41:29.864 --> 41:32.367
<i>* Tell me what scares you</i>
<i>the most *</i>

41:32.409 --> 41:35.704
<i>* Oh, whoa *</i>

41:35.745 --> 41:38.373
<i>* Been down the longest road *</i>

41:38.415 --> 41:41.710
<i>* Oh, whoa *</i>

41:41.751 --> 41:44.379
<i>* Tell me</i>
<i>what scares you the most *</i>

41:44.421 --> 41:46.006
- Rose.

41:46.047 --> 41:50.218
- How come our mothers,
the same women who leave us

41:50.260 --> 41:52.929
on Academy doorsteps as infants

41:52.971 --> 41:55.932
so they can go back
to being Guardians,

41:55.974 --> 41:59.769
still get to tell us
what to do?

41:59.811 --> 42:01.521
- I wanted to see
if you're okay.

42:01.563 --> 42:03.440
- You didn't get
that many good shots in.

42:03.481 --> 42:05.191
I'll be fine.

42:05.233 --> 42:06.693
- I didn't mean that.

42:11.906 --> 42:16.953
- Mason, I really only have
two uses for you right now,

42:16.995 --> 42:21.458
and I'm not really
in the mood to spar, so...

42:29.299 --> 42:30.717
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:30.759 --> 42:32.802
Wait a minute, Rose.
Wait a minute.

42:32.844 --> 42:35.472
Hey.

42:35.513 --> 42:38.725
I can't believe
I'm actually saying this.

42:38.767 --> 42:42.687
I'm not here for that now
in this moment.

42:44.064 --> 42:46.566
I thought we could talk.

42:46.608 --> 42:49.069
Thought I could be a friend.

42:49.110 --> 42:50.445
- [laughs]

42:50.487 --> 42:52.906
- Just pretend I'm Lissa, okay?

42:52.947 --> 42:54.574
- [laughs]

42:54.616 --> 42:58.620
- Don't laugh.
What would she do now?

43:00.288 --> 43:03.416
- Today, it felt
like the universe

43:03.458 --> 43:06.711
was conspiring against me.

43:06.753 --> 43:09.422
I may have given it
some extra help,

43:09.464 --> 43:12.425
but all I wanted was

43:12.467 --> 43:15.387
to help my best friend
feel better,

43:15.428 --> 43:17.138
<i>and I did.</i>

43:17.180 --> 43:19.516
<i>but I also know</i>
<i>the only way for either of us</i>

43:19.557 --> 43:21.434
<i>to ever feel normal</i>
<i>or whole again</i>

43:21.476 --> 43:24.729
<i>is to leave this place</i>
<i>and go live our lives.</i>

43:24.771 --> 43:27.732
[phone ringing]

43:27.774 --> 43:30.443
<i>[tense music]</i>

43:30.485 --> 43:32.445
Hello.

43:32.487 --> 43:36.533
<i>* *</i>

43:36.574 --> 43:38.910
This is Rose.

43:38.952 --> 43:41.621
- It is a pleasure to meet you,
Novice Hathaway.

43:41.663 --> 43:43.581
- And you as well,
Your Majesty.

43:43.623 --> 43:45.500
- Vasilissa Dragomir

43:45.542 --> 43:48.503
is an important member
of this Dominion.

43:48.545 --> 43:51.214
I also know
she's important to you.

43:51.256 --> 43:53.842
- She is, Your Majesty.

43:53.883 --> 43:56.219
- Perhaps you can tell me why.

44:01.933 --> 44:06.479
- Guardians are raised
to be tough.

44:06.521 --> 44:09.941
It's the only way to survive,
especially as a woman.

44:11.651 --> 44:14.654
And I am tough.

44:14.696 --> 44:19.451
But I have seen what

44:19.492 --> 44:22.579
battle can do to people.

44:22.620 --> 44:27.500
Lissa keeps my heart

44:27.542 --> 44:29.669
in the right place.

44:29.711 --> 44:32.339
She always has a kind word

44:32.380 --> 44:35.842
or a compassionate ear
for anyone who needs it.

44:35.884 --> 44:40.055
She's everything good
and everything right.

44:40.096 --> 44:41.264
And she's...

44:41.306 --> 44:44.642
<i>[soft music]</i>

44:44.684 --> 44:46.644
She's my family.

44:46.686 --> 44:51.024
<i>* *</i>

44:51.066 --> 44:54.069
- Thank you, Novice Hathaway.

44:54.110 --> 44:56.154
You are excused.

44:57.447 --> 45:00.408
A toast to you all

45:00.450 --> 45:02.994
on St. Vladimir's Feast Day.

45:04.412 --> 45:07.248
The last I'll witnesses
as your sovereign.

45:07.290 --> 45:10.877
It is time to name the next.

45:10.919 --> 45:13.963
- Your Majesty,
protocol demands

45:14.005 --> 45:17.008
the announcement be made
in a more formal setting.

45:17.050 --> 45:21.471
- Protocol can kiss
my aging Royal buttocks.

45:21.513 --> 45:24.432
For the next heir
to the throne,

45:24.474 --> 45:27.811
I name Vasilissa Dragomir.

45:27.852 --> 45:30.814
[gasping, whispering]

45:30.855 --> 45:33.775
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

45:33.817 --> 45:40.949
<i>* *</i>

45:43.702 --> 45:45.704
- [breathing heavily]

46:18.737 --> 46:21.614
<i>[electronic orchestral music]</i>

46:21.656 --> 46:28.830
<i>* *</i>

47:13.708 --> 47:14.876
<i>[dog barks]</i>
