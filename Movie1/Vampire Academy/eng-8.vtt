WEBVTT

00:13.722 --> 00:18.268
I'm invoking the ancient
right of Royal Trials.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.187
Whoever wins will rule.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.440
My parents chose
to become Strigoi.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.066
<i>They're looking for me.</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:28.194
<i>That could put Lissa in
real danger if she's with you.</i>

00:28.236 --> 00:30.405
Ahh!

00:30.447 --> 00:33.116
There can never be a question
with me or your charge.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.826
But you felt it--

00:34.868 --> 00:36.411
<i>what we could be.</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:38.747
Every second of it.
But never again.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.540
I don't want you
to be my guardian.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.917
You have no idea what I would
give up for you.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.169
I would die for you!

00:44.210 --> 00:46.296
Yeah, I know you would,
because you did.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.257
<i>You died saving me
in the accident.</i>

00:49.299 --> 00:50.800
I brought you back.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.219
That's why we have this bond
between our spirits.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.679
I can make you king.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.556
The toll it would take would
be too great.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.224
<i>You know that.
- I can handle it.</i>

01:01.644 --> 01:02.771
Slow down.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.314
Please! Ahh!

01:06.274 --> 01:08.068
<i>Sonya!</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:23.124
- Did they find her?
- No.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.628
They won't find a Strigoi.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.386
<i>Sonya will be fine.</i>

01:34.427 --> 01:36.429
<i>Obviously,
she's upset about Mikhail,</i>

01:36.471 --> 01:38.515
<i>so she stayed behind.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:41.101
<i>We can protect her.</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:43.937
<i>No one has to know.</i>

02:14.467 --> 02:17.345
<i>As we reach the end
of the first trial,</i>

02:17.387 --> 02:20.974
<i>I remind you all
that these ancient trials</i>

02:21.016 --> 02:23.643
<i>were designed to produce
an heir to the throne</i>

02:23.685 --> 02:27.772
<i>robust in body,
in wisdom, and in spirit.</i>

02:27.814 --> 02:29.357
<i>Your candidates,</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:32.652
<i>Lord Victor Dashkov
and Lady Tatiana Vogel,</i>

02:32.694 --> 02:35.989
<i>have spent a long
and grueling day</i>

02:36.031 --> 02:40.493
<i>in a physical endurance test,
braving the four Elements.</i>

02:40.535 --> 02:43.955
<i>Thus, it is the Elements,
not I,</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:46.750
<i>that decide who prevails.</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:52.005
<i>The winner
of the first trial is...</i>

02:54.049 --> 02:56.009
Lady Vogel.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.911
I'll take another.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.412
You've had enough.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.208
Oy!

03:38.051 --> 03:39.678
Sexy.

03:39.719 --> 03:40.929
A Strigoi.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.268
All right.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.229
Upsy daisy.
- No.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.189
- Let's get you home.
- I'm all right.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.899
I'll help you up.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.467
You're up late.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.515
I like the quiet.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.186
It's a shame how few
people I see in here,

04:30.228 --> 04:32.564
off hours or otherwise.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.774
It's a shame
how few people pray at all.

04:34.816 --> 04:38.445
I'm sorry our paths
haven't crossed recently.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.572
I'd hoped we might be friends.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.786
There's room for Dhampir
friendship in your ideology?

04:46.828 --> 04:50.457
My ideology
is rooted in faith,

04:50.498 --> 04:53.001
as is yours.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.879
I believe that makes us
kindred spirits,

04:55.920 --> 04:57.547
if nothing else.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.260
I heard you lost a charge
before you came

05:02.302 --> 05:04.721
to this province.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.056
A friend.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.768
And for three days
after his death,

05:09.809 --> 05:12.645
you were on your knees
before the altar,

05:12.687 --> 05:16.107
just you anchored
in your faith.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.321
I admire that.

05:27.869 --> 05:32.832
Lately, I've been feeling...

05:32.874 --> 05:34.626
unmoored.

05:36.294 --> 05:40.590
Have you ever doubted...
any of it?

05:43.927 --> 05:46.096
All of it?

05:46.137 --> 05:48.473
Every day.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.685
But if faith were easy,

05:51.726 --> 05:54.437
it wouldn't need
to be practiced.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.529
Now!

06:02.570 --> 06:04.197
<i>♪ Gotta fight the power,
ain't miss the flex ♪</i>

06:04.239 --> 06:06.032
<i>♪ I'm feeling happy,
I'm so impressed ♪</i>

06:06.074 --> 06:08.076
<i>♪ And my best self
is my best defense ♪</i>

06:08.118 --> 06:10.120
<i>♪ Can't take a L,
I'm too used to winning ♪</i>

06:10.161 --> 06:12.372
You know,
I thought you'd be rubbish

06:12.414 --> 06:15.959
when you asked me to train you,
but your timing's improving.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.336
You're getting those
off pretty quick.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.338
I need to be faster.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.425
So do I, if they catch me
helping a Moroi secretly use

06:23.466 --> 06:25.719
their magic to fight.

06:25.760 --> 06:31.599
Have you seen Mia around
anywhere last few days?

06:31.641 --> 06:34.561
She's helping Victor
with the trials.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.772
Ah, okay.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.817
Back at her dad's side,
palling around with royals.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.612
Nothing to worry about there.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.286
I liked new Mia.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.622
I just hope it wasn't a phase.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.505
Hi.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.885
Can I--

07:08.470 --> 07:10.472
Christian,
do you have a minute?

07:10.513 --> 07:11.973
Yeah.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.475
Yeah, of course.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.605
So I'm just--I'm gonna--

07:23.985 --> 07:25.487
So what are you
doing out so--

07:25.528 --> 07:26.738
Will you marry me?

07:31.493 --> 07:34.579
There's some really fucked up
things happening around here.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.873
I've already had
to make too many sacrifices,

07:36.915 --> 07:40.168
so if getting married gives
me a voice, so be it.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.465
So whatever happened
to this famous list

07:45.507 --> 07:47.717
of suitable bachelors?

07:48.635 --> 07:49.969
It expanded.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.805
Turns out you have
just enough Dragomir blood

07:51.846 --> 07:53.890
for me to regain my quorum.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.727
But it's just a marriage
of convenience.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.188
Nothing more.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.899
Sure.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.568
That's why you're asking me

08:05.610 --> 08:08.488
and not one
of the approved guys,

08:08.530 --> 08:11.616
for the convenience?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.827
I'm so glad
you find this funny.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.286
Kind of do.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.996
Stop it.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.836
So are you in or not?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.673
There's...

08:26.715 --> 08:29.300
something
you should know first.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.089
What you got there?

09:08.131 --> 09:09.716
Incentive.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.051
Cool mystery shit to dangle,

09:11.092 --> 09:14.471
so you tell me
what happened in Lisbon.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.389
Lissa and I had a fight.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.224
It's not a big deal.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.020
Come on, Rose.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.689
Everyone is asleep.
You can tell me.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.027
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.071
All right.

09:31.112 --> 09:35.075
This is everything
Meredith and I have gathered.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.452
One, the Strigoi went
from being loners

09:37.494 --> 09:39.704
to organizing, coordinating.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.248
Two, Christian's parents
breached the wards

09:42.290 --> 09:43.667
at St. Jude's.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.878
I heard the guardians believe
there was an inside man.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.089
Three, someone has been
leaving Christian gifts

09:49.130 --> 09:50.256
from his parents.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.466
Okay, but why?

09:51.508 --> 09:54.552
Some fucked up show
of love for their son?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.304
17 victims.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.224
That's not a fucked up
show of love.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.892
That's a slaughter.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.149
Those are the two
Dragomir victims.

10:09.943 --> 10:14.280
I met them once on holiday
with Lissa's family,

10:14.322 --> 10:16.783
before everything
turned to utter shit.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.254
Hang on a sec.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.720
Okay, so we think
Strigoi don't have motives

10:36.761 --> 10:39.305
because they're too feral, right?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.182
Yeah.

10:41.224 --> 10:45.145
But when we were in Portugal,
I swear to the Saints

10:45.186 --> 10:47.689
that the same Strigoi
was following us,

10:47.731 --> 10:50.525
and Lissa was
with me both times.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.194
She was in Meredith's convoy
when it got attacked.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.946
Maybe they're not coming
after Christian at all.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.948
Maybe they're coming after her.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.159
Okay, but what
about St. Jude's?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.120
That's how she lost
her shot at being queen

11:02.162 --> 11:04.080
and took out the rest
of her bloodline.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.833
Okay, but what do Strigoi
care about who's queen or not?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.043
They don't,

11:08.084 --> 11:10.086
or at least,
they didn't used to.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.172
So you think that someone
inside the royal court

11:12.213 --> 11:15.759
is conspiring with Strigoi
to take Lissa out?

11:24.059 --> 11:26.144
I think we should accept
that anything is possible.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.965
After my parents
started reaching out,

11:56.007 --> 11:58.635
Rose and I thought
that it wouldn't be safe

11:58.677 --> 11:59.969
for you to be with me.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.931
I can't believe
I didn't know any of this.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.724
Why wouldn't you tell me?

12:04.766 --> 12:06.434
Why wouldn't Rose tell me?

12:06.476 --> 12:09.104
I asked her
to let it be my secret.

12:11.147 --> 12:15.235
But I don't want to keep
anything from you anymore.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.279
I get that.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.657
It's just...

12:20.699 --> 12:23.493
I don't think Rose
has ever kept an actual secret

12:23.535 --> 12:24.994
from me in her life.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.663
Well, I guess
she was protecting you.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.373
Exactly.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.041
Like always.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.419
I'm the royal princess
that needs protecting,

12:32.460 --> 12:36.089
so Rose gives and gives,
and I take and take,

12:36.131 --> 12:38.466
which is why
I'm trying to actually do

12:38.508 --> 12:39.926
something about it.

12:39.968 --> 12:44.556
So again, are you in or not?

12:47.350 --> 12:48.852
I'm in.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.479
I'm so in.

13:03.199 --> 13:07.328
Come, we need to find
Christian, so that we can--

13:21.009 --> 13:22.427
Come on.
They're already waiting for us.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.804
- I know. I know.
- I know. That's what I said.

13:35.815 --> 13:40.111
<i>Round two, Trial by Proxy.</i>

13:40.153 --> 13:43.239
Our candidates will each select

13:43.281 --> 13:46.451
a worthy representative
in battle.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.661
It's fight night, people.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.163
Get ready.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.970
Hey, I've been
looking for you.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.102
Are you okay?

14:17.065 --> 14:19.442
Rose used to always say,
the one good thing

14:19.484 --> 14:21.695
about being a Dhampir
is you don't have

14:21.736 --> 14:23.530
to get married like Moroi do.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.952
She'd make fun of my ridiculous
12-year-old fantasies

14:28.993 --> 14:34.040
of unicorns
and 10,000 gold balloons.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.167
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:38.128 --> 14:42.007
And though the groom
was always a mystery...

14:44.509 --> 14:47.345
Rose was there...

14:51.266 --> 14:55.437
Wearing a dress
she'd probably hate,

14:55.478 --> 14:59.607
but pretending
she liked it for me.

15:01.901 --> 15:08.116
Even now,
with my parents gone...

15:08.158 --> 15:10.952
I always knew
my best friend would be there.

15:15.582 --> 15:20.628
This isn't a real marriage,
but still...

15:23.548 --> 15:28.970
Nowhere in all my fantasies
did I ever feel this...

15:29.012 --> 15:31.056
Lonely.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.402
I know.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.284
But you don't have to be.

15:52.952 --> 15:58.458
Because I will
always be here for you.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.837
However this came about
and whatever else

16:02.879 --> 16:05.507
this marriage will be,

16:05.548 --> 16:08.134
it will be real to me.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.222
Okay?

16:12.263 --> 16:14.599
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:18.853 --> 16:24.192
So what does this say about
how we're supposed to do this?

16:24.234 --> 16:28.279
So we have
to perform three rites,

16:28.321 --> 16:30.740
a blood-marking ceremony
under the eyes of the Monks...

16:30.782 --> 16:33.618
- Gross, but okay.
- An exchanging of gifts...

16:33.660 --> 16:35.704
Easy enough.

16:35.745 --> 16:39.916
And...

16:39.958 --> 16:43.128
a ceremonial announcement
of our betrothal.

16:43.169 --> 16:47.799
We have to announce ourselves
to the entire court...

16:47.841 --> 16:49.259
in public.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.223
Shit.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.891
All those people judging us.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.935
Can you handle it?

17:02.897 --> 17:06.151
For you, anything.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.344
No, it can't be about Lissa.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.471
How would my parents
even know about us?

18:16.513 --> 18:17.722
No one else does.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.641
What about Jesse Zeklos?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.726
He can come and go through
the walls as he pleases.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.187
He easily could have
smuggled those gifts in.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.106
Convoy in Lisbon.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.192
Didn't you say
he made you all leave early?

18:29.234 --> 18:31.319
He could have been
luring her there.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.488
His dad could have
put him up to it.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.325
Whoever's
behind this is trying

18:37.367 --> 18:39.244
to prevent Lissa's bloodline
from having a vote

18:39.285 --> 18:40.787
on the Council.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.747
Okay, so we think one
of the Elementalist bloodlines

18:42.789 --> 18:44.040
is responsible.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.625
Yes.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.211
Not to mention Dane Zeklos
was angling for the crown

18:48.253 --> 18:51.131
before the queen even
named Andre as heir.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.761
What if--

18:56.803 --> 19:00.181
what if the car accident
that killed Lissa's family...

19:00.223 --> 19:02.100
wasn't an accident at all?

19:21.578 --> 19:23.204
I know you don't want
to talk to me,

19:23.246 --> 19:25.331
but I'm not talking
to anyone else,

19:25.373 --> 19:28.084
because you are still
the person that I trust.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.962
There's more going on
around here than you think,

19:31.004 --> 19:33.381
including possible treason.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.260
Come on, I know
you think we shouldn't

19:37.302 --> 19:38.511
be talking right now, but--

19:38.553 --> 19:40.347
It's not what I think.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.016
It's what has to be.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.101
I've put you at risk.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.895
I've all but put Lissa at risk.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.313
I recall.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.983
I was there,
making my own choices.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.401
Were you?

19:53.443 --> 19:56.112
The only reason
you think you have a choice

19:56.154 --> 19:59.532
is because you were raised
by a powerful Moroi family

19:59.574 --> 20:03.244
who pretended that you
being Dhampir didn't matter.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.579
Maybe if I'd had that,

20:04.621 --> 20:07.248
I'd believe
that I could do anything too,

20:07.290 --> 20:09.959
but I don't.

20:10.001 --> 20:14.089
All I have is this life

20:14.130 --> 20:17.467
and the faith
that's helped me endure it.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.971
I can't lose that, Rose.

20:22.013 --> 20:25.225
It's not
that I don't want to help you.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.060
It's that I can't.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.856
This faith
that you're holding on to

20:31.898 --> 20:35.485
with a death grip
is supporting an unfair system

20:35.527 --> 20:38.697
that is never going to change.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.866
Maybe you should be
the one who does.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.077
I'm sorry.

20:44.119 --> 20:47.580
Am I interrupting something?

20:47.622 --> 20:50.625
I came to watch you train.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.919
I want to see what
I'm putting all my faith in.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.296
Faith in what?

20:55.338 --> 20:56.631
What for?

20:56.673 --> 20:58.466
Guardian Belikov has agreed
to be my champion

20:58.508 --> 21:01.219
in the second trial,

21:01.261 --> 21:03.054
the Trial by Proxy.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.395
Do carry on.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.344
- Did they find her?
- No.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.678
Hey, Dad.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.514
Oh, you just missed Sonya.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.516
She called from her hotel.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.352
Can you ring her back?

21:50.393 --> 21:52.312
She was off to the spa.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.564
Victor, who's your champion?

21:54.606 --> 21:56.149
Really, Rose?

21:56.191 --> 21:58.234
For the second trial, who?

21:58.276 --> 22:01.196
James has never lost
in hand-to-hand combat.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.572
Is that true?

22:02.614 --> 22:04.824
I have a record of 50 and 0.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.080
He won't beat Dimitri,
but I can.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.040
I know how he thinks,
how he moves.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.833
I understand him
better than anyone.

22:13.875 --> 22:17.712
I will win this, so pick me.

26:45.855 --> 26:49.192
Welcome
to the Trial by Proxy.

26:49.234 --> 26:52.445
Our candidates have each
selected two warriors

26:52.487 --> 26:54.531
to do battle on their behalf.

26:54.572 --> 26:55.990
By grace of the Elements,

26:56.032 --> 26:58.576
let us hope
they have chosen wisely.

26:58.618 --> 27:03.498
Lady Vogel has selected
Guardian Dimitri Belikov.

27:12.215 --> 27:17.804
And Lord Dashkov has selected
Novice Rose Hathaway.

27:36.031 --> 27:37.449
What are you doing here?

27:40.493 --> 27:42.620
I'm here to beat
some sense into you.

27:51.046 --> 27:54.007
Tatiana Vogel is everything
I hate about this place.

27:54.049 --> 27:56.676
- I do what I'm told.
- Right, your fucking duty.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.565
Why are you doing this?

28:10.607 --> 28:12.525
Apparently, it's
the only way you'll listen.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.194
Rose--

28:18.615 --> 28:20.408
You want me to stop?

28:20.450 --> 28:21.826
Win.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.668
You're taking it easy on me.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.252
Or maybe
you're just that good.

28:31.294 --> 28:32.837
Bullshit!

28:32.879 --> 28:35.340
What kind of a champion
refuses to fight?

28:35.382 --> 28:37.842
I don't want to hurt you.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.137
It's too late.

28:51.481 --> 28:54.192
Your honor as a champion is
on the line here, comrade.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.694
Come on.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.153
Our duty
won't let us be together?

28:57.195 --> 28:58.655
Then do your fucking duty.

29:01.366 --> 29:02.492
Yes!

29:49.456 --> 29:50.498
Yes.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.835
That's what I thought.

30:01.343 --> 30:04.179
The winner is Victor Dashkov.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.681
Thank you, champions.

30:06.723 --> 30:07.932
- Let's go!
- Whoo!

30:07.974 --> 30:09.517
Come on!

30:17.025 --> 30:19.069
Fight back.

30:21.654 --> 30:22.989
Fight back!

30:27.702 --> 30:28.703
Fight!

30:35.460 --> 30:36.711
Fight!

<i>Our third trial

31:08.243 --> 31:09.744

You okay?

31:09.786 --> 31:11.079
I'm fine.

31:11.121 --> 31:14.249
Because that fight
was kind of fraught.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.251
It's been a fraught
kind of week.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.044
Who's this source
we're talking to?

31:18.086 --> 31:19.587
Someone who might know
something about the night

31:19.629 --> 31:21.089
of the accident.

31:21.131 --> 31:22.674
You want to take a trip?

31:22.716 --> 31:24.884
No, thank you.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.678
What a shit show.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.055
Everyone's here
waving their flags,

31:29.097 --> 31:31.016
buying their drugs,

31:31.057 --> 31:33.393
no idea that someone
inside of these wards

31:33.435 --> 31:35.270
is in league with the Strigoi.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.230
Do you ever want to get
the fuck out of here?

31:37.272 --> 31:41.276
All the time,
but right now...

31:41.317 --> 31:43.445
we both know
what needs to happen.

31:48.199 --> 31:50.577
- No, no.
- Yeah.

31:50.618 --> 31:51.911
You can't just
spring this on me.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.496
Yeah, I can.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.123
And I am.

31:55.165 --> 31:58.168
You're a fucking mess, Rose.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.961
And what's going on
right now is too big

32:00.003 --> 32:02.380
for you to be off your game.

32:02.422 --> 32:05.050
Just talk to your best friend.

32:05.091 --> 32:08.261
Work your shit out, okay?

32:12.057 --> 32:13.683
Thank you.

32:20.565 --> 32:21.566
Hey.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.401
Hi.

32:23.443 --> 32:26.738
I guess, congratulations
on your engagement.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.825
Yeah.

32:30.867 --> 32:33.995
It's complicated.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.498
Christian told me
about your theory.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.500
I was hoping you and I
could find some answers

32:38.541 --> 32:40.502
in our memories of that night.

32:41.336 --> 32:43.505
But I don't remember
anything from the crash.

32:43.546 --> 32:47.342
I know, but I do,
and I can show you.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.720
How are we
supposed to do that?

32:59.688 --> 33:03.191
What you're asking for
is a memory walk.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.860
I've seen those
get quite messy.

33:05.902 --> 33:07.737
Plus, they're not cheap.

33:07.779 --> 33:10.323
We can handle it.

33:10.365 --> 33:14.703
Well then, get comfortable.

33:24.212 --> 33:26.548
<i>This is
the Trial by Reverie.</i>

33:26.589 --> 33:30.677
Our candidates will be
asked a single question

33:30.719 --> 33:34.389
while a flake of St. Vladimir's
dehydrated blood

33:34.431 --> 33:38.351
infused with Elemental magic
is placed on their tongue.

33:38.393 --> 33:41.354
Then they will be led
to a place of reflection,

33:41.396 --> 33:44.566
where they will experience
their reveries.

33:44.607 --> 33:48.236
The first candidate to emerge
with the correct answer

33:48.278 --> 33:50.739
will be declared the winner.

33:50.780 --> 33:56.327
<i>Your question--
what must a good ruler possess</i>

33:56.369 --> 33:59.706
<i>in order to rule
their subjects?</i>

33:59.748 --> 34:02.834
Talking aloud is critical
to a shared memory walk.

34:05.754 --> 34:08.089
You have to tell each
other what you see.

34:32.364 --> 34:33.698
I'm in the car.

34:35.492 --> 34:37.077
I can see your family.

34:39.037 --> 34:41.206
And the trees outside.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.833
I didn't think
we were going so fast.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.295
I see you.

34:47.337 --> 34:49.506
I see you too.

35:18.368 --> 35:20.954
Oh, what is this?

35:22.205 --> 35:23.998

36:20.764 --> 36:23.933
No.

36:42.494 --> 36:49.626

37:54.816 --> 37:57.527
That'll be 85 mirs, please.

38:16.504 --> 38:19.799
Daddy, Daddy,
Mia was mean to me.

38:19.841 --> 38:22.177
I was not mean to Sonya.

38:22.218 --> 38:23.928
She's just being a baby.

38:23.970 --> 38:27.265
Or maybe what you said
hurt Sonya's feelings.

38:27.307 --> 38:28.558
Because she's a baby.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.643
Because she isn't you.

38:30.685 --> 38:32.854
Sonya isn't like
anyone else, Mia.

38:32.896 --> 38:36.024
So we have to be gentle
with her, protect her.

38:36.066 --> 38:38.068
You don't really want
to hurt her, do you?

38:38.109 --> 38:39.194
No.

38:39.235 --> 38:41.446
Oh, that's my girl.

38:41.488 --> 38:43.782
Remember,
how you treat family says

38:43.823 --> 38:46.618
everything about who you are.

38:46.659 --> 38:48.453
Sorry, Sonya.

38:51.247 --> 38:53.208
Come here.

39:01.091 --> 39:04.719
Victor, have you
the answer to my question,

39:04.761 --> 39:08.973
what must a good ruler possess
to rule their subjects?

39:18.191 --> 39:21.319
I've learned something
very important,

39:21.361 --> 39:24.864
that a Moroi of integrity
must put his family first,

39:24.906 --> 39:27.492
above all.

39:27.534 --> 39:30.412
Love is the gift
of the Saints.

39:30.453 --> 39:32.789
It is pure.
It is unwavering.

39:32.831 --> 39:35.625
It is what will keep
this Dominion whole.

39:39.421 --> 39:43.758
But a ruler is not
just any Moroi,

39:43.800 --> 39:48.304
and love is not enough
to protect our citizens.

39:48.346 --> 39:52.809
Leadership requires sacrifice
for the greater good.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.230
<i>The answer to your question,
Your Majesty,</i>

39:57.272 --> 40:02.068
is that a good ruler must
possess nothing at all.

40:02.110 --> 40:05.155
They must be willing
to give everything they have

40:05.196 --> 40:08.116
in the name of the Dominion.

40:32.265 --> 40:35.393
The crown is yours, Victor.

40:35.435 --> 40:37.771
May your rule be prosperous.

41:16.893 --> 41:19.396
I came to apologize.

41:19.437 --> 41:20.939
I should not have
begun that fight

41:20.980 --> 41:22.774
knowing there was
no way I could do

41:22.816 --> 41:24.359
what I had to do to win.

41:26.277 --> 41:29.114
I'm going to ask to be
reassigned to another province.

41:29.155 --> 41:31.950
My value here has been...

41:31.991 --> 41:33.702
compromised.

41:36.246 --> 41:38.707
You're in love
with that girl, aren't you?

41:41.209 --> 41:43.753
But you can't be with her
without sacrificing the duty

41:43.795 --> 41:46.506
you pledged to the Saints,

41:46.548 --> 41:49.509
so you've chosen
not to be with her at all.

41:52.012 --> 41:54.889
Well, according
to the Elements then,

41:54.931 --> 41:57.267
you'd make a terrific king.

41:58.768 --> 42:02.105
I'm gonna let you
into a little secret, Dimitri.

42:04.899 --> 42:11.531
In the Reverie, I was hoping
to see someone I cherish,

42:11.573 --> 42:13.074
who I lost.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.870
But I didn't.

42:21.249 --> 42:24.419
It's hard wanting something
you can't have, isn't it?

I shouldn't be.
- You should.

42:49.986 --> 42:51.404
We all should.

42:51.446 --> 42:52.739
It should never have happened.

42:52.781 --> 42:54.824
If they were willing
to do what they did,

42:54.866 --> 42:57.285
having a seat on the Council
isn't nearly enough.

42:57.327 --> 43:00.121
I need to fight.
We need to fight.

43:06.586 --> 43:09.214
When your family died,
I kept thinking

43:09.255 --> 43:11.299
that as long
as you and I were together,

43:11.341 --> 43:12.842
that everything would be okay,

43:12.884 --> 43:17.806
that somehow we could
preserve some little part

43:17.847 --> 43:21.267
of that life before the crash,

43:21.309 --> 43:25.480
one where Moroi versus Dhampirs
didn't matter,

43:25.522 --> 43:27.982
and we could keep living
that sweet lie,

43:28.024 --> 43:30.735
untouched
by all the bullshit around us.

43:33.530 --> 43:36.032
But we can't.

43:36.074 --> 43:38.326
And I don't want to.

43:40.370 --> 43:42.997
I mean, you were right.

43:43.039 --> 43:46.334
We both need to find our way...

43:46.376 --> 43:48.336
without each other.

43:49.713 --> 43:52.757
Wait.
What does that mean, Rose?

43:52.799 --> 43:54.843
What does that mean?

43:58.513 --> 44:01.349
Such wonderful news.

44:01.391 --> 44:04.436
I heard
you finally got the girl.

44:05.895 --> 44:08.273
Honey, are you okay?

44:12.694 --> 44:15.030
Not really, no.

44:17.699 --> 44:19.784
If you're having a tiff
with Lissa,

44:19.826 --> 44:20.952
it will pass.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.412
You'll see.

44:22.454 --> 44:26.750
I'm not sure it can, but...

44:26.791 --> 44:27.834
thank you.

44:29.461 --> 44:31.921
Anybody else would have
thought I was crazy to think

44:31.963 --> 44:34.466
that Lissa and I would ever--

44:34.507 --> 44:36.634
but you,

44:36.676 --> 44:40.263
you supported
my relationship...

44:43.433 --> 44:45.435
Right from the start.

44:51.858 --> 44:54.694
It was Diane, not Jesse.

44:54.736 --> 44:56.863
I mean, she's the only one
who knew about you and me.

44:56.905 --> 44:59.199
She gets escorted
outside the wards every day

44:59.240 --> 45:00.575
along with all the Feeders.

45:00.617 --> 45:02.327
I mean, she must be
in contact with my parents.

45:02.369 --> 45:04.454
She must have some kind of...

45:08.208 --> 45:09.959
What is it?

45:10.001 --> 45:11.628
You were right.

45:13.171 --> 45:16.257
Rose and I
remembered everything.

45:16.299 --> 45:18.510
Your parents were there.

45:19.803 --> 45:22.222
- No.
- They murdered my family.

45:26.726 --> 45:28.103
Fuck!

45:31.064 --> 45:32.649
Fuck.

45:34.275 --> 45:36.403
I'm so sorry.

45:38.113 --> 45:39.322
I don't even know what to say.

45:39.364 --> 45:41.616
You don't have
to say anything.

45:43.952 --> 45:48.164
Your parents are not you.

45:48.206 --> 45:51.459
Their choices don't define you.

45:51.501 --> 45:53.753
Their actions don't mark you.

45:55.296 --> 45:57.298
And I'm sorry for everyone

45:57.340 --> 45:59.968
who's ever made you
feel otherwise.

46:06.850 --> 46:10.186
You are a good person, Christian.

46:11.771 --> 46:13.648
One of the best.

46:18.111 --> 46:19.738
But...

46:21.698 --> 46:23.825
But...

46:29.039 --> 46:32.167
When I marry you,

46:32.208 --> 46:37.130
I want music, and laughter,

46:37.172 --> 46:39.758
and friends...

46:42.302 --> 46:46.973
And to be able to look forward,
not back.

46:48.975 --> 46:53.563
I want it to feel right
in every way possible.

46:53.605 --> 46:59.027
But right now, all I feel

46:59.069 --> 47:03.323
is pain and rage.

47:10.789 --> 47:14.876
We never stood a chance,
did we?

47:19.673 --> 47:21.883
Um...

47:21.925 --> 47:23.510

All of this...

everything that's happened...

48:34.956 --> 48:36.624
it's is too much.

48:38.209 --> 48:39.753
I have to get out of here.

48:39.794 --> 48:41.921
No, Rose.

48:41.963 --> 48:45.175
I have to be loyal
to myself for a change.

48:45.216 --> 48:48.636
I need to make my life count.

48:48.678 --> 48:50.722
Remember when you thought
I'd get expelled,

48:50.764 --> 48:53.850
and you offered to go with me?

48:53.892 --> 48:56.144
I was just wondering
if the offer still stands.

48:56.186 --> 48:57.437
What?

48:57.479 --> 48:58.813
I mean,
I know we were at the bar,

48:58.855 --> 49:01.441
and we were drinking
and everything, but--

49:06.863 --> 49:09.407
Yes, Rose.

49:09.449 --> 49:11.284
Yes.

49:23.088 --> 49:24.839
We're so proud of you.

49:29.135 --> 49:33.181
A ruler must be willing
to give up everything he has?

49:33.223 --> 49:34.516
I was a little nervous.

49:34.557 --> 49:36.142
He didn't mean literally.

49:38.061 --> 49:39.771
You'll make
this Dominion a better place

49:39.813 --> 49:41.648
for our children, my love.

49:43.817 --> 49:47.362
I only wish Sonya was here
to celebrate with us.

49:47.404 --> 49:49.906
We spoke
just before the trial.

49:52.492 --> 49:54.411
She said this was all worth it.

50:11.970 --> 50:15.015
It is customary
for the runner-up

50:15.056 --> 50:17.559
to present a gift
to the winner,

50:17.600 --> 50:21.563
and tonight,
the Elements have declared

50:21.604 --> 50:25.108
Lord Victor Dashkov
your next king.

50:27.444 --> 50:29.863
Lady Vogel,

50:29.904 --> 50:32.991
are you ready
to present your gift?

50:34.826 --> 50:37.328
Indeed,
it is customary that I should

50:37.370 --> 50:42.834
give a concession speech
and congratulate the winner.

50:42.876 --> 50:47.464
And under normal circumstances,
I would be happy to do so,

50:47.505 --> 50:50.592
but these aren't
normal circumstances.

50:50.633 --> 50:52.927
We have shamed the Elements
with the choice

50:52.969 --> 50:55.597
of Victor Dashkov
during these trials.

50:55.638 --> 50:59.434
They could have never
have chosen a man so sick

50:59.476 --> 51:02.771
in body and in faith

51:02.812 --> 51:06.274
that he would allow
this to happen.

51:38.431 --> 51:39.724
Sonya!
