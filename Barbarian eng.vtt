What's the job about,
if you don't mind me asking?

14:48.821 --> 14:50.190
Yeah. It's okay.

14:50.323 --> 14:55.395
Um, it's a research position
for a documentary filmmaker.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.630
Really? Who's the filmmaker?

14:58.431 --> 14:59.766
Her name is
Catherine James.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.901
Catherine James?

15:02.702 --> 15:03.803
I don't know her.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.438
Has she done anything
I'd seen?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.875
Uh, she made a movie
about jazz last year,

15:09.009 --> 15:10.343
called Blue Easy.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.979
Oh, I saw that.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.280
You saw Blue Easy?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.747
I thought it was great.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.851
Are you kidding?
No one's seen that movie.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.887
About the makeshift
brass band?

15:21.021 --> 15:22.889
And there's that scene
with the kids on the rooftop,

15:23.023 --> 15:24.457
playing the Coltrane stuff?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.026
Yeah, it's great.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.427
I can't believe
you saw that.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.628
I thought
it was awesome.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.563
What's her new film
gonna be about?

15:30.697 --> 15:33.233
Oh, it's gonna be about
this place. Detroit.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.534
Like Detroit music?

15:34.667 --> 15:36.069
Oh, well, it's gonna be
about the artists

15:36.203 --> 15:37.504
that have come here
in the last ten years

15:37.637 --> 15:41.608
and set up collectives
and creative communities
on the...

15:41.741 --> 15:42.775
Well, the edge of...

15:42.909 --> 15:44.611
Where the houses
are basically free.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.613
That's pretty cool.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.148
Do you know
who you should
interview for that?

15:49.016 --> 15:49.983
Who?

15:50.383 --> 15:51.684
Me.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.686
Why is that?

15:53.820 --> 15:56.789
Because I'm actually
one of the founders
of the Lion Tamers.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.926
You're kidding.
No.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.761
I mean,
I'm not, like, the guy,

16:01.894 --> 16:03.997
but I'm one
of the guys, yeah.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.098
That's insane.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.966
It is insane.
(LAUGHS)

16:07.100 --> 16:08.668
What are you doing
in an Airbnb?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.837
Don't you guys, like, have
a whole block or something?

16:10.970 --> 16:11.971
No, yeah.
No, we do.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.174
But we're looking for
a new space.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.542
So, I'm here
for a week,

16:15.675 --> 16:18.478
basically just scouring
this side of town.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.148
Looking for
our next little nest.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.882
Oh, my God.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.184
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

16:25.585 --> 16:27.420
KEITH: It's not a cliche
I've heard before.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.422
TESS: Oh, come on.
It's such a cliche.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.225
The guy who thinks
love and control
are the same thing.

16:32.359 --> 16:35.195
And the girl
who lets herself become,

16:35.328 --> 16:38.131
I don't know,
some kind of pet
or something?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.200
Oh, my God.
It's so cliche
and it's so boring,

16:40.333 --> 16:41.634
and I can't believe
it's happening to me.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.103
Is it still happening?

16:43.936 --> 16:45.372
I mean, look at you.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.074
You already got
your new job
lined up.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.442
Mmm. Job interview.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.378
I don't have the job yet.
I'm not home free.

16:51.511 --> 16:55.014
Look. There's always
gonna be people

16:55.148 --> 16:57.717
that project some
kind of dynamic

16:57.850 --> 16:59.719
onto us that serves them.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.689
It's up to us if we wanna
play ball or not.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.125
Is that my lesson?

17:05.258 --> 17:07.194
I don't know. I don't know.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.097
(CHUCKLES) I just need
to stop going back.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.200
I keep going back.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.401
Maybe that's it.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.036
Or maybe my lesson is that

17:17.170 --> 17:19.906
guys will walk all over you
as long as you let them.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.674
Yeah. That's my lesson.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.543
I take issue
with that statement.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.278
Oh, yeah. That's 'cause
you're a guy.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.280
(LAUGHS) I mean,
the world's
different for you.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.717
Guys get to blast
their way through life
making messes.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.485
Girls have to be careful.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.587
Elaborate.
Okay. Take tonight.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.256
If I had been the one
that checked in first

17:36.389 --> 17:37.757
and you showed up
late at night...

17:37.890 --> 17:39.226
What, you wouldn't
have let me in?

17:39.359 --> 17:40.960
Hell no.
I wouldn't have let you in.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.729
Do you think I'm crazy?

17:42.862 --> 17:45.132
But if I was dumb enough
to let you in,

17:45.265 --> 17:46.233
you wouldn't even think twice.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.500
You would just march on in.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.068
Hey, you just marched on in.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.170
Yeah, because
I had to.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.871
And it was scary.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.906
What, do I look like
some kind of monster?

17:54.040 --> 17:55.308
Not my point.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.744
I get it.
I get it.
I mean...

17:57.877 --> 18:02.149
There's a lot of bad dudes
out there. And it sucks.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.583
Look, are you
gonna stay locked

18:03.716 --> 18:05.585
into some fucked-up
toxic dynamic

18:05.718 --> 18:06.953
that somebody else
picked for you?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.288
Or are you gonna
move on?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.290
Maybe find someone else.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.492
Even if that means
that you may get your heart

18:12.625 --> 18:14.261
ripped outta your chest
all over again.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.830
Hmm. Why is it
always the girls

18:17.964 --> 18:20.032
who get their hearts
ripped out in these things?

18:20.900 --> 18:24.237
Girls can rip.
Trust me.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.839
Okay, so now that
it's inside out...
TESS: Right.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.074
Right? That's
the first step.
Yeah?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.509
KEITH: Then,
now you kind of go deep.
No.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.178
You dive in.
(LAUGHS)

18:31.311 --> 18:32.579
KEITH: Now, this...
Trust me. This is
the best way to do it.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.247
No, you're fucking with me.
This is not how you do it.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.216
KEITH:
This is how you do it.
This is the best way.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.285
It never bunches up.
It gets completely smooth.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.486
You'll thank me later
when you're lying

18:39.619 --> 18:40.953
under a perfectly
even duvet, here.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.088
So, if, but...
Looks so dumb.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.656
KEITH: So, here...
Right?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.925
Here is where I kinda
need your help a little bit.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.194
Now that you're here...
Oh, my God.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.428
...you have to be my
assistant.
Right.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.496
KEITH: If you wouldn't mind,

18:49.629 --> 18:50.897
grabbing the duvet...
Okay.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.300
...and you kinda give me
the two edges

18:53.433 --> 18:55.101
where my edges are...
Yeah, sure.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.803
...where the two meet.
All right, thank you.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.104
Okay. You got it?
Thank you very much.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.307
So, back up 'cause now
it gets a little bit...

19:00.440 --> 19:02.309
A little...
My God. (LAUGHS)

19:02.442 --> 19:05.178
A little aggressive
with the thing.
TESS: Oh, my God.

19:05.312 --> 19:10.317
But that is how
you get the duvet in.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.220
(EXCLAIMS) So graceful.
That's how you do it.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.855
Are you usually
this outta breath afterwards?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.524
(PANTING) The final...

19:17.657 --> 19:19.459
Grab that edge there, please.
Mmm-hmm.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.329
KEITH: Okay, and...
Yeah, yeah.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.030
Wow.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.435
Okay. Well, you are
officially situated.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.503
Yeah. I think
that about does it.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.474
KEITH: Yeah. (LAUGHS)

19:38.845 --> 19:40.980
Okay, thank you
for tonight.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.383
Sorry for keeping you up
before the big day.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.518
Oh, no.
It was fun. I...

19:46.052 --> 19:47.354
I liked it.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.155
Yeah. Me, too.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.797
Okay, there's a couch
that needs to be...
Yeah. Yeah.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.232
Put in gear here, so...

19:59.366 --> 20:00.367
I'm so sorry.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.201
Oh, don't be.
Don't be.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.703
I can sleep
on anything.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.705

be there.

the neighborhood
is a little...

a convention in town
or something?

Megan Maddox has contacted

What'd she say?

is taking this
very seriously.

44:33.438 --> 44:35.006

decide how to proceed.

DAVID: AJ, I think, honestly,
the most likely outcome
of all of this

44:52.623 --> 44:54.392
is that even if the show
does go forward...
Yeah?

44:54.525 --> 44:56.627

that you will be involved.

let's assume

46:31.589 --> 46:33.158
that the income we have
for the year

46:33.291 --> 46:34.826
is what we're gonna have
at year's end.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.427
No new money
coming in.

46:36.561 --> 46:37.896
I think that's
pretty safe to say.

46:38.029 --> 46:39.998
What do you anticipate
your legal expenses to be?

46:40.131 --> 46:41.599
So, I talked it over
with my lawyer,

46:41.732 --> 46:43.835
and, um, we're looking at
two separate cases here.

46:43.969 --> 46:46.537
There's the defense
against the charge,

46:46.671 --> 46:50.108
which is 100% not true,
by the way.

46:50.241 --> 46:52.543
So, there's that, and then
there's the countersuit
for defamation,

46:52.677 --> 46:55.146
which I'm 100% gonna win.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.921

probably gonna be,
like, around 70,000 each.
