01:26.250 --> 01:28.241
When I was three,

01:28.333 --> 01:30.119
mum left us.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.663
Dad lied to me that mum was just hiding.

01:33.667 --> 01:36.374
She will come back for me when I grow up.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.411
She is inside the lighthouse.

01:41.375 --> 01:44.742
Mum, come out. I miss you so much.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.161
Hey!

02:58.542 --> 03:01.033
- Good morning, miss lai.
- Good morning!

03:03.542 --> 03:05.123
"Memorial ceremony of Lee yuk Ian"

03:12.500 --> 03:14.786
Highlight of the week!

03:14.792 --> 03:16.703
Chow Kai kwong, the chairman
of auroara telecommunication corporation,

03:16.708 --> 03:19.620
the Chinese-American gatsby
of entertainment-media field,

03:19.833 --> 03:22.666
has successfully acquired macao's hotel.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.582
This news convulsed both America
and Macau's financial field.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.619
Mr. chow ranks 8th on the list
of Chinese-American billionaires

03:42.625 --> 03:44.661
announced by fortune in 2014.

03:44.667 --> 03:47.500
He has one daughter, Debbie chow.

03:48.583 --> 03:51.165
Everybody sees? Interesting is that

03:51.167 --> 03:54.785
Debbie's foreign boyfriend
just proposed to her.

03:54.792 --> 03:56.657
Once the bodyguard arrived,

03:56.667 --> 03:58.703
that handsome guy... oops...

04:00.083 --> 04:02.039
Sweetie, don't tell me you choose this man.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.373
"Coward"

04:03.375 --> 04:05.457
your taste is just getting worse!

04:05.458 --> 04:06.823
Come on!

04:09.625 --> 04:11.490
You haven't played enough in these years?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.500
Not really.

04:15.917 --> 04:19.865
One bet. You come back
to be the ceo for a year.

04:19.875 --> 04:23.914
After that, I won't interfere in your life.

04:25.042 --> 04:26.907
Seriously?

04:27.583 --> 04:28.823
But what's the duty of a ceo?

04:28.917 --> 04:30.748
Put this on and we will talk.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.161
Wear this?

04:41.458 --> 04:44.291
I have something important to do, see you.

04:45.208 --> 04:47.415
Ask Jose if there is any problem.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.583
Who's "se"?

04:54.625 --> 04:56.035
Miss ch... ch... chow

05:01.542 --> 05:09.542
"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound"

05:11.250 --> 05:18.031
"that saved a wretch like me!"

06:03.583 --> 06:05.539
We still have an unfinished fight.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.073
Bye!

06:31.792 --> 06:33.077
Uncle kin!

06:44.208 --> 06:47.371
My name is uncle kin.
I like cars since I was young.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.578
They are an inseparable part of my life.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.748
Macau is the whole world to me.

06:51.917 --> 06:54.329
One midnight, it took
me less than 10 minutes

06:54.333 --> 06:55.453
to take a round in my world.

06:55.792 --> 06:57.282
I enjoy simple living.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.874
I have been with phillis since secondary 3.

07:00.292 --> 07:03.079
When all people think
we will never break up,

07:04.042 --> 07:06.078
this indeed makes me feel harder...

07:06.250 --> 07:08.036
To maintain this relationship.

07:12.208 --> 07:16.201
Hey! Ho! Hey!

07:20.167 --> 07:21.498
Lion king competition!

07:22.583 --> 07:23.823
Oh, my shoe!

07:23.833 --> 07:25.243
Arrh...

07:26.250 --> 07:29.538
Hand off! 3,5,5! 13 for large!

07:29.542 --> 07:30.497
Hey, shi tze wah!

07:30.500 --> 07:32.661
How many times I have told you
this is not a gambling den?

07:32.667 --> 07:33.656
Lower your voice!

07:33.667 --> 07:37.865
Just be vigorous! Excuse me. 13 for large.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.197
- Good morning miss lai.
- Good morning!

07:43.750 --> 07:44.750
Hello?

07:44.792 --> 07:47.864
- Is me.
- Sis, you look nice on TV.

07:47.875 --> 07:50.366
Shut it up. You know what?

07:50.375 --> 07:53.082
My dad caught me back
and made me be the ceo.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.118
That's great!

07:54.125 --> 07:58.198
Great? He left me some gms to brief with.

07:58.292 --> 08:00.123
- What am I supposed to brief?
- Good morning miss lai.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.332
Hey, I have to go. Hang up now, bye.

08:02.667 --> 08:04.282
Hey, hey, hey!

08:07.167 --> 08:08.782
I'm late. Be quick!

08:09.917 --> 08:10.952
Be quick!

08:13.458 --> 08:14.698
- Good morning...
- You again?

08:14.708 --> 08:18.121
Coming every Monday...
Miss lai doesn't want to see you.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.581
- Flowers again?
- Yes.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.583
Sigh, just pass to me.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.703
- Auntie fan!
- Sh...

08:24.000 --> 08:27.538
Yan, I told you not to
call me auntie at school.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.743
You forgot again.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.582
Ok, miss lai.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.121
10, 9, 8, 7...

08:35.125 --> 08:37.366
Mr. Monday comes again.

08:37.375 --> 08:40.491
4.3, 2,1

08:47.417 --> 08:50.124
I will come back next Monday!

08:50.625 --> 08:54.493
Mr. Monday is nearly perfect.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.081
You are still not interested?

08:56.333 --> 08:58.949
Having French cuisine every day is boring.

08:59.042 --> 09:01.078
Just for this reason? Poor him.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.408
Wow, Indian lunchbox again.

09:09.417 --> 09:12.659
No grand French meal but Indian food...

09:12.667 --> 09:14.874
It is so delicious!

09:15.958 --> 09:18.950
This butter chicken with...

09:18.958 --> 09:19.993
Lachabrata

09:20.000 --> 09:22.867
they together smell much
stronger than durian.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.788
I, on behalf of all staff, request you
to quarantine yourself while eating.

09:26.792 --> 09:29.249
I believe that...

09:29.250 --> 09:30.330
You are actually an Indian!

09:32.292 --> 09:35.455
We have to take action. Yes!

09:44.292 --> 09:46.999
Morning everyone! I am Debbie.

09:47.542 --> 09:51.239
This is my first day here.
Nice to meet you all.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.200
Even though you don't say it out,

09:56.208 --> 09:59.655
I know what you are thinking.

10:00.458 --> 10:05.782
"She gets this post
only because of her father."

10:05.792 --> 10:06.998
That's true.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.833
I will implement new measures.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.956
Firstly, staff parties.

10:11.958 --> 10:13.949
Secondly, muay thai boxing competition.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.664
Thirdly, rock climbing competition.

10:15.667 --> 10:16.873
And premier league tickets'll be given

10:16.875 --> 10:17.739
with your year-end bonus.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.493
I will lead you all to
watch Manchester derby!

10:21.500 --> 10:24.367
Hahaha...

10:24.375 --> 10:26.661
Everyone cheers up!

10:30.292 --> 10:33.455
Kelvin, let's rehearse the act
"the edge of heaven".

10:33.458 --> 10:34.573
"Musical "met a 1941s girl" in rehearsal"

10:34.583 --> 10:36.323
just sing it out.

10:37.375 --> 10:41.368
Director, the leading actress
hasn't yet arrived?

10:45.083 --> 10:48.575
Maty, why the leading
actress is late again?

10:48.583 --> 10:49.413
Sorry.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.309
I have called her for times
but she didn't pick up.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.914
We are amateur,

10:52.917 --> 10:54.327
not unprofessional.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.289
Alright, I will call her now.

10:58.833 --> 11:02.371
- You, come here.
- Yes.

11:03.042 --> 11:06.660
I want you to do this act
with the leading actor.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.747
Do this act?

11:08.042 --> 11:09.498
Yes, go!

11:09.500 --> 11:10.785
But I don't know how to act.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.123
You don't really have to. Just stand there.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.205
Come and stand here.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.115
Kelvin, try it.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.615
- Me?
- Stand in here

11:17.042 --> 11:18.907
is music ready?

11:18.917 --> 11:20.498
3,2,1, go!

11:26.250 --> 11:28.036
This is dom Pedro v theatre.

11:28.042 --> 11:30.249
Normally, no video
shooting is allowed here.

11:30.292 --> 11:32.954
But with the help of instituto cultural,

11:32.958 --> 11:35.074
we can rent it this time.

11:35.750 --> 11:39.868
"I have no regrets meeting you."

11:39.917 --> 11:42.875
Good, now's the female vocal.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.331
At chorus, I want you to...

11:45.333 --> 11:53.160
"Christmas night,
my tears involuntarily run down"

11:53.958 --> 11:59.248
"the planes shines far in the wind"

12:00.500 --> 12:06.826
"the sound of bombs is unceasing."

12:07.208 --> 12:11.952
"Heaven falls and earth rends."

12:12.542 --> 12:19.243
Bn 4a one in silence?
"How many people are g

12:19.542 --> 12:25.788
"we fail to wait for the dawn."

12:26.292 --> 12:32.618
"What can I do now?"

12:33.125 --> 12:41.125
"No guarantee for tomorrow."

12:45.833 --> 12:52.955
"My heart is a shooting star"

12:53.083 --> 12:59.283
"falling into the uncertain future."

12:59.833 --> 13:06.659
"Will he and I be still in love?"

13:07.625 --> 13:15.625
"Who is my love for life?"

13:26.667 --> 13:30.205
Sorry, I just can't stop singing it out.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.248
Phillis, you sang well!

13:32.250 --> 13:33.535
- Yes.
- Really?

13:34.500 --> 13:37.572
Hi, my name is Marco,
a music producer in mainland.

13:38.042 --> 13:40.624
Can I talk with your manager?

13:40.833 --> 13:42.073
What?

13:48.417 --> 13:50.499
Miss ch... ch... chow

13:50.958 --> 13:51.993
you again?

13:52.000 --> 13:57.495
Miss ch... chow, are you wearing
the senior staff uniform?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.991
Yes. This is my first day of work.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.160
I want to inspect the
daily operation before

14:01.167 --> 14:04.489
the staffs know my identity.

14:05.417 --> 14:06.417
Is it ok?

14:07.583 --> 14:08.583
Nice!

14:09.083 --> 14:10.083
What's your name?

14:11.208 --> 14:12.493
Jo... Jose

14:12.500 --> 14:14.036
Jose!

14:18.542 --> 14:21.579
Why don't you introduce yourself?

14:21.583 --> 14:23.369
Any special interest?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.413
Yes. It is hard to share with you...

14:28.333 --> 14:35.614
How hard can it be?
Half of my friends are also... Jose.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.411
- Ch... ch...
- Hello

14:39.375 --> 14:40.375
hello

14:41.542 --> 14:43.032
don't follow me.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.457
People can guess what's going on
if you're with me.

14:45.458 --> 14:46.698
But...

15:01.292 --> 15:02.452
Hello

15:10.167 --> 15:11.167
Cousin wah!

15:12.833 --> 15:13.743
Shanghai girl!

15:13.833 --> 15:15.289
Let's go to another table!

15:15.292 --> 15:16.702
She is here for wah again.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.287
Little cousin. You don't need
to come this frequently.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.783
- I miss you!
- I need to make this clear.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.707
I have no feeling on you.

15:29.708 --> 15:32.415
Don't waste your time torturing me.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.157
You want to do things the hard way?

15:34.625 --> 15:36.411
Do you know how many nobly gentlemen

15:36.417 --> 15:39.739
don't even get the chance to see her?

15:39.917 --> 15:40.952
How lucky you are!

15:40.958 --> 15:42.869
Ok, chill.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.537
Treat me as a normal customer.

15:45.958 --> 15:48.574
I have no choice but to serve you then.

15:48.792 --> 15:50.999
Be quick. Place your bet.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.989
Enough for talking! Let's bet!

15:55.750 --> 16:03.122
Why not? Koyuki. I won't be gentle.

16:12.708 --> 16:16.451
Won 8 times in a row!
He is really "bad luck wah"!

16:17.750 --> 16:19.581
I am known for bad luck.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.164
How hard is it to win upon me?

16:21.167 --> 16:22.373
Let's change the rule.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.163
If I win, I accompany you for a year.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.407
Great! What if you lose?

16:28.417 --> 16:30.954
If I lose, you go back to Shanghai

16:30.958 --> 16:31.947
and never come back.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.620
Large bet...

16:34.708 --> 16:36.539
Ok, deal!

16:36.542 --> 16:37.873
Ok

16:47.375 --> 16:48.375
Large!

17:17.791 --> 17:21.329
I can finally hang around with my cousin!

17:22.416 --> 17:25.454
"Bad luck wah" is now "lucky wah"!

18:14.208 --> 18:15.323
Excuse me.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.790
Do you know where travessa
do armazém velho is?

18:18.042 --> 18:21.114
Travessa do armazém velho? I have no idea.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.456
Sorry, I am new to here.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.364
It's ok.

18:23.375 --> 18:24.581
You are from another place too?

18:24.583 --> 18:26.869
Shanghai. I am leaving tomorrow.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.537
Maybe you can ask other people. Sorry.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.157
- Thanks!
- Bye.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.123
At this moment,

19:09.125 --> 19:12.617
I feel like falling in love with this city.

19:17.375 --> 19:25.248
"Little store in good condition seeks
for new owner."

19:47.417 --> 19:49.248
What's wrong? Future star.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.115
That Marco is

19:54.125 --> 19:56.491
a famous music producer in mainland.

19:57.042 --> 19:59.124
He arranged me to be

19:59.125 --> 20:03.118
the representative of Macau
for a singing contest.

20:03.750 --> 20:07.948
I am so nervous now.

20:08.292 --> 20:16.292
What to do? Oh god...

20:17.000 --> 20:18.365
Don't freak out.

20:18.375 --> 20:21.947
Just sing happily as in the choir.

20:26.958 --> 20:28.198
Come with me!

20:34.292 --> 20:35.873
What exactly can I do there?

20:35.875 --> 20:37.581
And I am not free.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.699
I have my big plan on the
racetrack this year.

20:53.083 --> 20:54.289
Uncle kin!

20:55.958 --> 20:57.038
What?

20:57.417 --> 20:59.499
Marco said

20:59.500 --> 21:01.991
if I determine to be a singer,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.582
I will have to attend intensive trainings.

21:09.708 --> 21:11.949
I will not be with you all the time.

21:15.250 --> 21:16.535
Let's deal with it later.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.498
Dinner is ready.

22:16.792 --> 22:18.783
- Go to hell!
- Go to hell!

22:22.167 --> 22:23.532
- Ka sing.
- Yes!

22:23.750 --> 22:26.583
- Have you been to the lighthouse?
- No, what's with it?

22:32.792 --> 22:34.373
Kai kwong, you jerk!

23:17.917 --> 23:19.828
Yuk Ian is the daughter of the lightkeeper.

23:20.167 --> 23:21.498
She took photos for people there
in her spare time.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.287
To earn some money.

23:24.875 --> 23:27.833
That person in the church
was chow Kai kwong?

23:29.083 --> 23:32.951
Yuk Ian hit both of us like a thunder.

23:36.917 --> 23:39.158
Why did she choose you at last?

23:41.458 --> 23:44.416
Chun keung, I am telling you...

23:45.500 --> 23:49.118
I met yuk Ian at the lighthouse,
we've been married for 40 years.

23:51.167 --> 23:54.580
I try to move on after she left.

23:55.625 --> 23:59.197
My daughter's left for 5 years.
You still can't let go.

24:00.708 --> 24:05.327
Life is short. Don't waste it.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.285
Get a new girlfrined.

24:11.208 --> 24:12.208
I am busy with the shop.

24:13.292 --> 24:15.999
I don't care if you go clubbing
or speed dating,

24:16.583 --> 24:18.494
just don't spend the whole day at home.

24:20.917 --> 24:25.081
Don't worry about me. I
have many things to do.

24:25.292 --> 24:28.079
My cholesterol level is
a bit high recently.

24:28.292 --> 24:31.409
Don't always ask me out for dinner.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.490
He said his ass was like on fire.

24:36.958 --> 24:38.573
He is just exaggerating.

25:25.250 --> 25:29.118
My wife is a diehard fan of Indian culture.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.992
Our first movie was "pumpkin bungee jump"

25:39.500 --> 25:44.290
Even though there was no subtitle,
we enjoyed the movie much.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.790
After my wife left,

26:10.792 --> 26:13.249
I tried to watch Indian movies by myself.

26:14.167 --> 26:16.499
I see this girl every time.

26:20.125 --> 26:23.117
She always laughs out loud.

26:26.208 --> 26:28.824
The last time I went there,

26:28.833 --> 26:30.824
whenever I heard her laughter,

26:31.500 --> 26:33.707
I felt that my wife

26:34.625 --> 26:37.458
was sitting right next to me.

26:37.667 --> 26:42.286
After that, I don't watch
movies there anymore.

26:55.708 --> 26:57.915
Aunt, I am back.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.492
What happened, tao tao. Are you sick?

27:01.500 --> 27:02.910
Punished by the teacher again?

27:05.875 --> 27:08.457
Daddy, I am jilted...

27:37.083 --> 27:39.790
Is you, manager! What a coincidence!

27:39.875 --> 27:40.910
Oh, is you.

27:41.375 --> 27:44.037
- We are destined for this encounter.
- Yes.

27:44.125 --> 27:48.368
My car broke down. Do you have the contact
of car towing service?

27:48.375 --> 27:50.161
You earn around ten thousand a month.

27:50.167 --> 27:51.577
How can you afford a car like this?

27:51.750 --> 27:52.910
Defalcation?

27:53.250 --> 27:55.081
Me?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.331
I borrow it from a friend.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.448
I see.

28:03.292 --> 28:06.125
I planned to dine at feliciano.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.457
Feliciano? I am familiar with there.

28:13.708 --> 28:14.708
Ok.

28:26.208 --> 28:27.368
Snaky wah?

28:30.417 --> 28:33.329
Hey, snaky wah, how many seat?

28:33.333 --> 28:36.825
- Two seats, fat b.
- Here is feliciano?

28:37.292 --> 28:40.489
It's weird... feliciano?

28:40.500 --> 28:42.081
Why are we here at fommei hotpot?

28:42.833 --> 28:44.243
Oops, I messed up.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.616
Never mind! Fonmei hotpot is tasty too.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.161
Come!

28:48.500 --> 28:49.330
Here!

28:49.417 --> 28:53.660
- Good job!
- Of course, cold beer?

28:53.667 --> 28:54.907
Thanks!

28:57.917 --> 28:59.202
You are Mr. big!

28:59.667 --> 29:02.534
I have many friends.
Connections are important.

29:05.292 --> 29:06.292
Your girlfriend?

29:06.708 --> 29:09.120
No. But hard to tell in the future.

29:10.167 --> 29:12.874
- Dare to say again?
- I'm just kidding!

29:12.875 --> 29:15.287
No doubt you keep it a secret, snaky wah.

29:15.667 --> 29:18.033
Snaky wah? Call him master shi.

29:18.042 --> 29:20.033
Yes, master shi.

29:20.042 --> 29:21.532
Master? Why?

29:21.583 --> 29:23.323
Master of shi style kung fu.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.823
Snake?

29:24.958 --> 29:27.165
- Fat b! Come, come, come.
- Yes.

29:27.417 --> 29:30.489
Tonight, their table's bill is on me.

29:35.083 --> 29:37.199
Ok, theirs is on me too.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.414
No problem.

29:39.917 --> 29:41.623
Master has much money in his pocket.

29:41.625 --> 29:44.662
I am just on my own,
friends are important to me.

29:44.667 --> 29:46.828
I can't spend all money on myself.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.197
Thanks master.

29:48.292 --> 29:50.374
Thanks Mrs. shi.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.957
Not Mrs. shi. Just Debbie.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.450
Mrs. Debbie shi.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.832
Cheers!

29:59.500 --> 30:02.742
This group of beasts can drink. Can you?

30:03.042 --> 30:06.079
Can 1? You want to cover for me?

30:06.292 --> 30:07.577
Take care of yourself first.

30:07.875 --> 30:11.538
Ok. Fat b.

30:11.542 --> 30:13.749
Such a fun night. Take my treasure out!

30:13.875 --> 30:15.740
This generous?

30:15.750 --> 30:18.116
All are my treat tonight!

30:18.208 --> 30:19.914
Wow!

30:19.917 --> 30:25.037
Cheers!

30:26.333 --> 30:28.540
Cheers!

30:37.708 --> 30:39.949
The address is in the pocket.

30:42.042 --> 30:43.748
Forgot to tell you.

30:44.083 --> 30:50.739
I am the female champion
of england drinking competition

30:59.167 --> 31:01.749
Great, finally a nice sleep tonight.

31:04.667 --> 31:05.702
Idiot,

31:05.708 --> 31:08.324
don't get drunk when the taxi
can't park under your building!

31:10.500 --> 31:12.036
You live so far away

31:14.250 --> 31:15.956
ouch!

31:18.708 --> 31:20.039
Ouch!

31:20.250 --> 31:22.206
Snaky wah, it's midnight!

31:22.375 --> 31:24.286
- People have to sleep here!
- Mrs. ho,

31:24.292 --> 31:27.125
you will never get this slipper back!

31:27.250 --> 31:34.076
Hey! Didn't you say you
would act like drunk?

31:34.292 --> 31:36.658
I am really drunk.

32:28.750 --> 32:29.956
Snaky wah!

32:29.958 --> 32:32.620
Give me back the slipper!
You have a crush on me”?

32:38.458 --> 32:39.868
Dad, I help you take a drink?

32:39.875 --> 32:41.536
Just ask Jose to take it.

32:41.667 --> 32:43.658
No, I will do it myself.

32:44.125 --> 32:45.205
Sure.

32:49.458 --> 32:51.995
Hello - hello

32:54.500 --> 32:57.822
oh, are you that chow Kai kwong?

32:58.500 --> 32:59.535
Yes.

32:59.792 --> 33:00.326
Yes

33:00.542 --> 33:03.739
Mr. chow, you are the new boss
of this hotel, right?

33:04.167 --> 33:05.873
Sort of.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.241
Oh, then I am so sorry.

33:08.250 --> 33:12.539
We won a lot of money here.

33:12.542 --> 33:14.032
Wow, how much did you win?

33:14.333 --> 33:15.373
More than twenty thousand.

33:16.042 --> 33:20.115
Twenty thousand! You
really have to spare us.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.869
Try my best. Try our best.

33:25.125 --> 33:27.616
I will fire you if you keep following me.

33:29.458 --> 33:32.245
L... l... try to do something else then.

33:36.708 --> 33:39.450
Hurry, she is waiting for you.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.616
You go there first. I will catch up.

33:45.042 --> 33:48.660
- Go!
- I will tell her.

33:49.583 --> 33:50.583
Chirp.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.083
Why are you here?

33:56.292 --> 33:57.498
Why are you here?

33:59.250 --> 34:00.706
Why didn't you find me?

34:00.792 --> 34:01.792
Why should I find you?

34:02.708 --> 34:05.950
- Last night...
- What?

34:05.958 --> 34:08.791
Cousin, why putting on the swimming trunks
takes you so long?

34:08.792 --> 34:10.202
Calling you, labrador.

34:10.458 --> 34:14.451
Listen, I am not a labrador.

34:14.958 --> 34:16.118
Haha~

34:16.458 --> 34:21.077
and now I have to go
and deal with that. I will be back.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.786
Cousin, come.

34:27.792 --> 34:28.621
Mr. chow,

34:28.625 --> 34:31.367
I would like to introduce my honey to you.

34:32.333 --> 34:34.197
- Say hello to boss.
- What?

34:34.958 --> 34:37.244
He is the new boss of this hotel!

34:37.333 --> 34:38.243
Hello, Mr. chow.

34:38.292 --> 34:41.204
You are a staff of our hotel?

34:41.208 --> 34:43.244
Yes, my name is shi tze wah.

34:44.417 --> 34:48.911
You have to swim with the customer.
Thanks for your hard work.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.327
You are welcome.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.581
You two are such a match today.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.994
Good observation.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.912
We are meant to be together
since we were young.

34:59.125 --> 35:00.535
No, she is just kidding.

35:00.708 --> 35:03.541
We are just distant relatives.

35:03.542 --> 35:05.828
Nonsense.

35:05.833 --> 35:08.324
Don't talk any more.
Let's have fun in water.

35:08.333 --> 35:09.693
You know I don't know how to swim.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.911
- No problem. I will teach you.
- No,

35:11.958 --> 35:14.540
I don't want to learn.
I really don't want to...

35:14.542 --> 35:19.832
Cousin, cousin!

35:20.042 --> 35:21.327
Help! Help!

35:21.333 --> 35:22.368
Relax. Relax.

35:23.333 --> 35:26.120
Spread out. I will do the cpr.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.373
Oh my dear lord!

35:53.208 --> 35:55.324
Hi miss. Your coffee

35:55.500 --> 35:57.786
thank you - enjoy!

36:00.958 --> 36:03.791
- Thank youl!
- Enjoy!

36:15.083 --> 36:17.199
- What do you want to drink?
- Latte

36:18.375 --> 36:19.975
excuse me, may we have 2 cups of coffee?

36:38.333 --> 36:39.448
How is it? Great?

36:41.750 --> 36:43.832
- How is it?
- It looks awful.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.616
- I need to punish you!
- Come on, it looks wonderful.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.535
No!

36:52.625 --> 36:54.081
Ok, I will draw on my face then.

36:58.167 --> 36:59.282
I will help.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.990
Wait, no!

37:24.167 --> 37:25.452
Am I disturbing you?

37:32.333 --> 37:36.201
No. Anyway, I am closing the shop soon.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.286
- I help you tidy up.
- No, thanks.

37:45.958 --> 37:48.745
Are we... still friends?

37:55.292 --> 37:57.123
You haven't contacted me for a year.

38:01.417 --> 38:03.032
What kind of friend this is?

38:07.542 --> 38:08.657
I'm ss 0 rry!

38:09.750 --> 38:11.286
I don't want to hear this.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.280
Go back. Forget everything.

38:17.542 --> 38:18.497
You are right in front of me!

38:18.500 --> 38:20.491
How can I forget you and everything?

38:20.583 --> 38:21.663
Ok

38:24.667 --> 38:28.159
Now you see me. So?

38:32.292 --> 38:34.624
I just broke up with her.

38:38.458 --> 38:41.245
You come to me after breaking up with her.

38:42.417 --> 38:46.535
Should I say thank you?
Should I be thankful for this?

38:47.958 --> 38:50.324
You think I have nothing to do
but just waiting for you

38:50.333 --> 38:52.619
after breaking up with you?

38:53.750 --> 38:55.536
I know you will wait for me.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.072
You waited for me no matter how slowly
I painted before.

39:07.417 --> 39:09.203
You still keep the painting.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.953
It means you still have me in your heart.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.368
Give me back.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.660
No.

39:18.458 --> 39:19.493
I said let go.

39:24.708 --> 39:26.708
Do you really treasure our days
together this much?

39:28.208 --> 39:30.699
If so, why did you leave me?

39:30.708 --> 39:34.530
I am asking you!

39:34.542 --> 39:39.161
You like it that much,
then why did you leave a year ago?

39:40.458 --> 39:41.618
Answer me.

39:43.125 --> 39:45.662
I am asking you why you left!

40:16.958 --> 40:19.495
Congratulations! Congratulations!

40:19.500 --> 40:20.706
Thanks! Thanks!

40:21.208 --> 40:21.822
We are married!

40:21.875 --> 40:24.833
I do this for the sake of auntie fan.

40:24.917 --> 40:27.158
Don't think that I really like you!

40:27.167 --> 40:31.035
Got it! Ouch!

41:09.333 --> 41:10.914
Fan, are you alright?

41:14.333 --> 41:16.415
Something happened. Come and help!

41:16.542 --> 41:18.749
Ok, coming.

41:19.542 --> 41:21.422
You behave weird all the time.
Join us quickly.

41:21.458 --> 41:22.664
Ok!

41:32.292 --> 41:37.662
Yan, since we skipped rope together
in the pe lesson,

41:38.125 --> 41:40.582
I have been missing you for all time.

41:40.708 --> 41:45.202
I want to tell you this now. I love youl!

41:46.167 --> 41:49.534
Can you be my girlfriend?

41:50.125 --> 41:53.617
14th nov. Tao tao.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.741
See? How ridiculous!

41:55.750 --> 41:57.206
Of course!

41:57.208 --> 41:59.244
Didn't I teach you the format
of a letter before?

41:59.292 --> 42:02.249
Start in a new row. Leave 2 boxes of space
at the beginning.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.832
What's more, the date should be
after your signature.

42:04.833 --> 42:05.868
I taught you before.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.874
Miss lai, be serious!

42:08.875 --> 42:10.786
They are getting married!

42:14.167 --> 42:15.782
I need to see your parents.

42:16.083 --> 42:18.244
My dad will beat me up!

42:18.250 --> 42:19.365
No room for negotiation.

42:19.542 --> 42:21.157
I don't need to see your parents

42:21.167 --> 42:23.032
because I am meeting your mum tonight.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.407
So ridiculous...

42:31.250 --> 42:32.615
Seel

42:32.625 --> 42:35.367
this is achillis lock.

42:35.375 --> 42:37.331
Once I've locked you,

42:37.333 --> 42:39.369
you cannot move. Try it.

42:39.375 --> 42:40.285
Ouch. Yes,

42:40.292 --> 42:41.077
- I cannot move.
- Of course.

42:41.083 --> 42:44.246
This one is armbar.

42:44.542 --> 42:46.032
Once I did that,

42:46.042 --> 42:48.033
you will surrender because of the pain.

42:48.042 --> 42:49.828
Ouch! It's so painful! I surrender!

42:50.625 --> 42:51.990
What's wrong with you?

42:52.000 --> 42:54.286
Good evening. How many seats needed?

42:55.375 --> 42:56.831
Hey beauties, what for drinks?

42:57.292 --> 42:58.782
I want a bottle of red wine.

42:58.917 --> 42:59.917
Sure.

43:01.583 --> 43:02.993
Wait.

43:03.583 --> 43:07.030
Maybe 2 glasses of gold
label reserve instead.

43:07.042 --> 43:08.042
No problem.

43:08.875 --> 43:12.288
Surrender! I surrender!

43:16.542 --> 43:18.282
Dad - yes?

43:18.417 --> 43:20.453
I want to ask you one thing.

43:21.667 --> 43:22.667
What?

43:23.333 --> 43:25.073
Do you miss mum?

43:27.208 --> 43:28.208
Yes.

43:28.500 --> 43:31.367
Well... after mum died,

43:31.583 --> 43:34.541
have you ever loved another woman?
Answer me!

43:36.042 --> 43:39.239
Well. That's not for a kid to know.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.697
Just answer me.

43:42.917 --> 43:44.327
That's not for a kid to know.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.333
Just answer me.

43:45.583 --> 43:46.698
Silly kid!

43:52.167 --> 43:55.079
Once, I thought no one
can take my wife's place

43:56.375 --> 43:57.911
until a year ago...

43:58.250 --> 43:59.740
When I met the woman

43:59.750 --> 44:01.706
who passed me a handkerchief in the cinema.

45:29.333 --> 45:30.539
Come! Cheers!

45:32.083 --> 45:33.573
Cheers!

45:41.000 --> 45:43.366
I don't talk about the past.
Let's talk about the present.

45:43.708 --> 45:47.121
So where is your Mr. right?

45:47.375 --> 45:48.684
Want me to introduce one for you?

45:48.708 --> 45:53.532
I have never changed. He is my Mr. right.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.124
What? You still love this Indian Andy lau?

45:56.333 --> 45:58.198
Let's be serious.

45:58.208 --> 46:01.325
It is really difficult to find a man
who is willing to

46:01.833 --> 46:03.243
watch Indian movies with you.

46:07.333 --> 46:08.789
A few years ago,

46:08.792 --> 46:11.579
I met a man who likes
watching Indian movies.

46:59.750 --> 47:02.913
I met him again later...

47:26.042 --> 47:27.907
After that time,

47:28.167 --> 47:30.783
I have never seen him again.

47:33.375 --> 47:35.286
Hey! Did you see it?

47:35.292 --> 47:38.034
It's still shining. Don't fool me.
Bottom up.

47:40.792 --> 47:45.240
A big man cried like that

47:45.333 --> 47:47.949
he must have gambled away all his money.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.457
No, he was caught...

47:50.458 --> 47:51.868
Having a mistress.

47:51.875 --> 47:55.743
No. If you saw the sadness in his eyes,

47:55.917 --> 47:58.454
you would know he actually
lost his true love.

47:58.708 --> 48:01.120
Alright. I'll show you.

48:02.333 --> 48:05.120
Losing money or being caught
having a mistress...

48:05.125 --> 48:07.286
Looks like this.

48:13.458 --> 48:17.622
Losing the true love is like this.

48:20.917 --> 48:22.202
The difference is obvious.

48:23.250 --> 48:24.831
You painted quite a picture.

48:26.125 --> 48:29.083
You're right. You're right.

48:29.542 --> 48:30.998
Then how about you?

48:31.292 --> 48:34.910
Me? I am awesome.

48:36.042 --> 48:39.079
You know what?

48:40.042 --> 48:43.034
The day before I came back here

48:43.667 --> 48:46.739
a handsome guy had proposed to me.

48:46.958 --> 48:48.494
That's great!

48:49.708 --> 48:52.199
He made all the vows,

48:52.208 --> 48:56.326
promised to protect me
and said all the sweet words.

48:56.958 --> 48:59.040
When he saw my dad's bodyguard

48:59.208 --> 49:02.245
walking to me like the hulk,

49:02.667 --> 49:06.580
he escaped fast... like the flash.

49:11.708 --> 49:15.872
I am used to this already.
Not the first time.

49:17.333 --> 49:22.498
However, I feel like not believing
in love anymore.

49:22.708 --> 49:25.074
What? Don't believe in love?

49:25.958 --> 49:28.700
All I want is so simple.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.161
I just want someone

49:31.167 --> 49:34.864
who is brave enough to love me.

49:35.167 --> 49:37.032
That's it.

49:50.875 --> 49:52.035
What?

49:54.083 --> 49:55.163
I think of someone.

49:56.333 --> 49:57.573
Here you go!

49:59.292 --> 50:04.741
Did you say nothing can stop you from love?

50:05.000 --> 50:08.788
Yes! Nothing can stop me from love.

50:08.792 --> 50:11.454
Nothing can stop me... arrh!!

50:11.458 --> 50:12.538
- Drink!
- Drink!

50:13.167 --> 50:16.125
- Drink!
- Cheers!

50:18.375 --> 50:21.367
Uncle kin. Thank you!

50:22.208 --> 50:24.699
Thank you? It took me the whole day
fixing your car.

50:25.375 --> 50:28.492
Hey, we are like brothers.
Don't grumble at me.

50:28.708 --> 50:30.994
Don't grumble? Hey!

50:32.167 --> 50:33.202
I heard from your friends that

50:33.208 --> 50:35.699
you brought a beauty to fumei hotpot.

50:35.917 --> 50:37.748
Wow, you heard this too?

50:38.375 --> 50:40.411
Well, the girl is just so-so.

50:40.417 --> 50:41.748
So-s0?

50:43.583 --> 50:44.993
Your face's telling me
that she is not just so-so.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.912
Really? I am telling you.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.160
Women...

50:49.167 --> 50:52.239
They are too complex and illogical
for you to understand.

50:52.792 --> 50:53.872
Let's not talk about this.

50:53.875 --> 50:55.365
When my car will be done?

50:55.375 --> 50:57.331
Come on. Not tonight.

50:57.333 --> 50:59.039
I have to watch the singing
contest of phillis.

50:59.042 --> 51:01.408
Anywhere is the same.

51:01.417 --> 51:02.873
You don't need to go
back home to watch that.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.581
You can watch it here, can't you?

51:04.583 --> 51:06.323
Do you remember?

51:06.333 --> 51:08.870
When we were young, we
watched digimon here.

51:10.292 --> 51:12.408
Still so sharp and clear.

51:12.708 --> 51:14.588
Japanese product, a
guarantee for good quality.

51:14.750 --> 51:16.160
Have you checked your eyes?

51:17.542 --> 51:19.282
You are not helping me?

51:19.292 --> 51:20.623
What kind of brother you are?

51:21.375 --> 51:24.117
I won't do the good luck ritual
for you at new year.

51:24.125 --> 51:25.490
No luck for you next year!

51:26.625 --> 51:29.082
Hey! Your car...

51:29.083 --> 51:32.496
I will pee on it. The urine will
corrode the engine. Come on!

51:32.500 --> 51:35.412
Look! I meant it. I am doing it!

51:35.500 --> 51:40.164
Shh...

51:40.208 --> 51:42.415
Please, we are best buddies.

51:42.750 --> 51:44.957
Please! I beg you!

51:47.167 --> 51:47.997
Why I know a rascal like you...

51:48.000 --> 51:49.740
What have I done wrong?

51:57.167 --> 51:58.828
Ah...

51:58.833 --> 52:00.184
What's the next line? Can't remember.

52:00.208 --> 52:01.208
Phillis

52:04.750 --> 52:06.240
relax.

52:06.792 --> 52:08.623
I teach you one knack.

52:08.667 --> 52:11.204
Just think all people under the stage
are blind,

52:11.208 --> 52:12.208
ok?

52:12.292 --> 52:13.292
Ok.

53:50.042 --> 53:51.407
Forty years ago,

53:51.417 --> 53:55.160
two good friends fell in love
with the same girl.

53:56.333 --> 53:58.053
One is of them was so confident of himself.

53:59.792 --> 54:02.283
He suggested a way to resolve this...

54:03.750 --> 54:05.510
I bought two movie tickets
from two cinemas.

54:06.083 --> 54:06.868
Ka sing and I will be

54:06.875 --> 54:08.786
waiting for you in
separate cinemas tomorrow.

54:09.208 --> 54:12.371
Cinema alegria or cinema Victoria,
it's your choice.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.282
The next competitor is

54:31.292 --> 54:33.078
phillis from Macau.

54:33.083 --> 54:34.539
Age 20.

54:34.542 --> 54:37.579
She is singing "self-rescue".

54:40.292 --> 54:47.198
"Crying to fatigue, vocal
cord is worn out."

54:48.292 --> 54:52.831
"My whole world collapsed because of you."

54:54.333 --> 55:01.114
"No sleep for seven days,
no food for three meals. Who cares?"

55:02.292 --> 55:06.160
"Let the fever be with me on bed."

55:07.625 --> 55:15.625
"If I can rescue myself, fight with
the lovelorn feeling till the end,"

55:16.083 --> 55:21.453
"I wish I could accept everything tomorrow
after getting drunk tonight."

55:21.792 --> 55:29.792
"There's no way for self-rescue.
I breathe for you."

55:30.083 --> 55:36.704
"I am willing to be kept as a puppet.”

55:45.083 --> 55:46.198
Dad.

55:46.250 --> 55:47.250
What?

55:47.333 --> 55:51.246
Don't bring me to eat Indian food anymore.

55:51.375 --> 55:54.037
I feel uncomfortable when I go to toilet.

55:54.417 --> 55:56.499
I miss your mum

55:57.292 --> 55:59.954
so I want to find the same taste as hers.

56:00.708 --> 56:02.289
No way

56:04.167 --> 56:05.167
dad

56:05.542 --> 56:06.531
what?

56:06.542 --> 56:08.624
I remember mum telling me that

56:08.917 --> 56:11.499
the day you proposed to
her in the lighthouse

56:11.750 --> 56:14.366
was the happiest day in her life.

56:15.750 --> 56:17.456
Same for daddy.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.323
Go to sleep now.

57:14.083 --> 57:16.540
Want to prove that you love me,

57:16.542 --> 57:20.990
you will have to live each day
to the fullest... cheer!

58:48.792 --> 58:52.910
After I'm gone, don't miss me anymore.

58:53.417 --> 58:55.829
Want to prove that you love me,

58:55.833 --> 58:59.280
you will have to live each day
to the fullest... cheer!

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:12.415
Miss chow ran away again.

01:00:12.417 --> 01:00:14.123
Boss will fire us when we get back.

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:16.867
You don't say! Just search!

01:00:31.958 --> 01:00:35.155
Hey, do you remember me?

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:40.497
Travessa do armazém velho, ha...

01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:41.789
How are you?

01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:45.205
Fine. You said you were leaving.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.990
Why are you working here?

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.866
I stay here to open this cafe.

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:55.536
I need to get changed. I'll be right back.

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:56.542
Sure.

01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.203
- Byebye.
- Byebye.

01:00:58.542 --> 01:01:03.787
Get changed... there's a
reason for you to stay.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:07.744
May I ask you a question?

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:08.788
Ok.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:11.283
Do you find

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:13.157
love just like fruits?

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.207
The sweetness doesn't last long.

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:25.457
Once you missed it,
you can never taste it again.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:50.074
Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.665
I... I want to give you
back the handkerchief.

01:02:39.792 --> 01:02:41.123
I bring you to learn Indian martial art.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.865
I teach you to cook Indian curry.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.205
I am yeung chun keung!

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:46.869
I am lai tze fan!

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:06.288
Hi!

01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:17.072
Uncle kin!

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:18.083
Yes?

01:03:18.167 --> 01:03:19.782
Remember? The monitress from

01:03:19.792 --> 01:03:21.248
our primary school lives here.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:24.661
We always played around here at that time.

01:03:25.667 --> 01:03:28.659
Of course I do. You once bumped your head.

01:03:28.958 --> 01:03:31.244
My mum beat me up for that.

01:03:33.917 --> 01:03:35.282
Yes...

01:03:39.167 --> 01:03:40.998
Sorry!

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:17.409
Oh, I haven't congratulated you yet.

01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:22.289
You look pretty today.

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:31.789
Thanks!

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:35.450
This dress was

01:04:35.458 --> 01:04:37.619
chosen by the stylist of Marco.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.665
There were many reporters from Hong Kong.

01:04:43.042 --> 01:04:44.828
It's pity that you could not come...

01:04:53.542 --> 01:04:59.458
I am busy for the garage
I don't have spare time...

01:05:14.083 --> 01:05:16.540
I will go to Japan for the training
two days later.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.900
My family will hold a farewell party
for me tomorrow's night.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.914
You have to come!

01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:27.748
Leave it later.

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:38.082
No, promise me. You have to come.

01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:57.322
You love drinking coke so much.
You don't know Japanese.

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:58.664
How can you order it?

01:06:20.958 --> 01:06:22.573
Leave it later.

01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:35.578
That is, let's leave it later.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.706
Uncle kin, drink?

01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:08.708
A bottle of beer!

01:07:23.917 --> 01:07:27.034
Hey! Did you watch "the singer of China"?

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.579
Yes, a girl from Macau has got
into the semifinal.

01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:31.786
Yes, I watched that too.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:34.078
That girl is petite and yet sings well.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.745
It doesn't matter how well she sings.

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:38.991
Pretty face and great
body are king and queen.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.867
Why is singing related to those?

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:43.740
Are you really this innocence?

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.991
How can you get into the semifinal
without going backdoor,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.240
getting on bed nowadays?

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.615
You are right.

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:51.458
Your face, your fate.

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.289
Well said!

01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:15.784
"Hey! Come and help now! Mum has prepared
so much food. Wait for you!"

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:26.532
"Police station"

01:09:52.082 --> 01:09:54.369
"Waiting for you!"

01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:02.405
"Let's break up!"

01:14:32.292 --> 01:14:35.159
"To cheung ching"

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:47.664
- Kai kwong?
- Ouch!

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.082
Ka sing, are you alright?

01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:13.449
Cousin, don't be like this...

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:55.909
Hey, can you bring me to see Debbie?

01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:58.241
No way. I will be fired!

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.957
I really miss her much!

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:02.289
Bring me to see her!

01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:04.203
N... n... no!

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:06.994
You are the best person in this company.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.197
Most handsome... understanding.
How can you not help me?

01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:12.539
N... no!

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.115
Please!

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:15.702
N... no!

01:17:15.708 --> 01:17:16.914
Seriously?

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:18.458
No!

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.286
- Yan!
- Uncle keung.

01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:29.702
Where is miss lai?

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:30.708
She is back.

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:35.745
How can you still smile?

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:39.706
- Auntie fan!
- Miss lai!

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:45.865
Hello, miss lai.

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:47.118
I am not miss lai.

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:48.831
I am the language teacher from mainland.

01:17:48.833 --> 01:17:50.789
What? Why?

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.536
Isn't auntie fan handling this?

01:17:53.542 --> 01:17:55.453
Yes, we want auntie fan.

01:17:56.042 --> 01:17:57.282
Oh, miss lai just left.

01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:59.328
She asked me to help handle this.

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:02.700
That's different. Let's wait for her.

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:03.830
Please come with me.

01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:04.833
Ok.

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:12.868
Over there.

01:18:15.708 --> 01:18:16.708
Thanks, Jose!

01:18:17.542 --> 01:18:22.787
Al... although you are a... a rascal,

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:31.531
you are brave to fight for your love.
You are worth helping.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.365
It is not about being brave.

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:36.206
I just know that if I don't do this now,

01:18:36.708 --> 01:18:40.246
[...i will... will regret for sure.

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:11.373
Don't bar my way! I need to see Debbie.

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:13.411
What are you doing here? Get out!

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:18.163
No more words. Come one. Chinese kung fu!

01:19:18.167 --> 01:19:20.408
Shi style, snaky fist!

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:26.162
You jerk,

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:28.158
punched on my face! It's painful!

01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:52.658
You just aimed at my face! It hurts!

01:20:17.042 --> 01:20:18.782
I need to see Debbie!

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:23.206
No one can stop me!

01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:25.368
You hear me?

01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:26.875
Understand?

01:20:36.542 --> 01:20:37.782
Debbie!

01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:43.284
Debbie! I really like you!

01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:45.785
Snaky wah!

01:21:08.417 --> 01:21:09.417
Amigo!

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.332
Did you two forget your medicine today?

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:24.535
Hey, you are going for a girl?

01:21:25.083 --> 01:21:27.043
Hey! Snaky wah is going for a girl!
Come help him!

01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:36.789
Dumb kei, come and help!

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:38.698
Heading where? Propose?

01:22:44.708 --> 01:22:46.448
I don't want to be an expired fruit!

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:19.411
Miss ling, I'm sorry.

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:20.953
They are just mischievous.

01:23:21.208 --> 01:23:22.914
I guarantee that they
will never do this again.

01:23:22.917 --> 01:23:23.952
Right, tao tao?

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:28.200
When teachers and parents
build up better connections,

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:30.415
children will have fewer
behavioural problems.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.116
I don't see you out. I leave first.

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:35.491
- Alright, goodbye.
- Bye.

01:23:39.417 --> 01:23:40.998
Why are you two downcast?

01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:45.413
Let's go home.

01:23:47.292 --> 01:23:51.661
Tao tao, you've grown up. Behave well, ok?

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:54.708
You've promised your mum.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.206
What's the matter?

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:09.530
I am not naughty. I just want a mother!

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:12.366
Every classmate has one, why not me?

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.910
I want a mum!

01:24:13.917 --> 01:24:17.409
Why I don't!

01:24:17.417 --> 01:24:21.706
Why? Tell me!

01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:26.031
I want a mum. I don't care!

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.831
Sorry son.

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:39.656
I promise you. I will find you a mother.

01:24:41.417 --> 01:24:47.083
Stop crying. Let's go home.

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.286
Stop crying. Let's go.

01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:06.539
"Okenkidesuka"

01:28:07.583 --> 01:28:09.198
is "how are you".

01:28:09.958 --> 01:28:13.951
"Oishii"

01:28:15.167 --> 01:28:16.327
"delicious".

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.910
"Matane"

01:28:20.917 --> 01:28:22.157
means "see you later".

01:28:24.333 --> 01:28:26.244
"Ganbatte"

01:28:30.542 --> 01:28:31.907
"do the best!"

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:42.617
"Watashiwako-ra-gadaisukidesu"

01:28:43.292 --> 01:28:49.117
it means "il like coke."

01:29:17.625 --> 01:29:22.619
I like coke.

01:29:25.333 --> 01:29:29.827
I like coke.

01:29:31.292 --> 01:29:35.160
I like coke.

01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:12.870
I haven't been here since you left.

01:30:13.125 --> 01:30:16.367
Then why did you ask me to come?

01:30:20.667 --> 01:30:22.123
This is from yuk Ian.

01:30:48.833 --> 01:30:50.949
If you choose Kai kwong

01:30:52.208 --> 01:30:54.540
I'll give you two all my blessing.

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:16.489
- Kai kwong?
- Ouch!

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.707
Ka sing, are you alright?

01:31:33.167 --> 01:31:36.580
I didn't go to any cinema that day.

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:39.700
My decision was not made before the movie.

01:31:40.292 --> 01:31:42.032
It was after the movie.

01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:45.913
I don't need a competent man.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.829
I just want a man who loves me.

01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:51.118
Kai kwong

01:31:51.125 --> 01:31:56.290
your world is about business, not love.

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:18.083
Sorry.

01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:21.538
Don't be. You deserve it.

01:32:22.833 --> 01:32:24.414
Good to know that you understand.

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.286
Don't mix things up.

01:32:31.292 --> 01:32:34.489
I come here to finish the fight with you.

01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:38.582
Are you fine?

01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:46.781
Come, fight me!

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.536
Let's finish the fight.

01:32:49.792 --> 01:32:51.282
Come. Kick me.

01:32:54.417 --> 01:32:55.156
Come!

01:32:55.208 --> 01:32:57.073
Come! Get here!

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.500
Come!

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:09.241
Stab me? I'll twist your piggy ears!

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:10.202
Twist them off!

01:33:10.208 --> 01:33:11.789
Still stab me in the eyes?

01:33:12.875 --> 01:33:15.116
Come on! Come!
