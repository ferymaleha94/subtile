Y'all hear that ringin'?
It's the cops.

44:42.549 --> 44:44.769
[dispatcher] 9-1-1 operator.
What's your emergency?

44:44.943 --> 44:48.555
Hello-- hello? Yes, yes, yes.
Um, I called earlier.

44:49.556 --> 44:51.689
Me and my girlfriend
are stayin' up over at,

44:51.863 --> 44:53.821
uh, 12 Turtle Lake Road.

44:53.995 --> 44:56.606
-Sir, is this about the cow?
-It's not about the damn cow.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.261
Somebody's out here
messin' with us.

45:00.088 --> 45:01.699
[water bubbling]

45:10.533 --> 45:12.231
[water splashing]

45:12.405 --> 45:13.580
Fuck!

45:13.754 --> 45:16.409
[terrifying music playing]

[fire crackling]

45:32.164 --> 45:35.167
[frightening chord]

45:45.699 --> 45:47.396
-[Shaina] What happened?
-Close all the windows

45:47.570 --> 45:49.311
-a-- a-- and lock 'em.
-What happened? What's wrong?

45:49.485 --> 45:51.139
-[Mark] Just do it!
-Okay.

45:51.313 --> 45:53.315
[sinister music]

45:53.489 --> 45:56.101
[panting]

45:56.275 --> 45:57.580
Fuck.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.017
[Shaina]
What did you see out there?

46:01.323 --> 46:02.585
What was it, Mark?

46:02.760 --> 46:04.109
Um...

46:04.283 --> 46:05.980
[Shaina] What was it?

46:06.589 --> 46:08.940
Uh... I think I saw
somethin' i-- in the lake.

46:09.505 --> 46:10.593
I think it was a hand.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.247
What?

46:12.421 --> 46:13.771
I saw a fuckin' hand
in the lake, Shaina.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.731
[Shaina]
Like, a human hand?

46:17.905 --> 46:19.951
[Mark]
Yeah. I'm pretty sure of it.

46:20.821 --> 46:22.170
We need
to get outta here.

46:22.736 --> 46:25.086
Right, right, right.
Give me your phone.

46:25.260 --> 46:26.392
It's in the car.

46:26.958 --> 46:28.742
Why the fuck
would you leave it in the car?

46:28.916 --> 46:30.831
I don't know, Mark.
Where's your phone?

46:32.790 --> 46:33.878
Where are the keys?

46:34.748 --> 46:36.054
[Shaina]
You're not going out there.

46:36.228 --> 46:37.490
I'm just going to
get the phone.

46:37.664 --> 46:38.883
-Mm-mm.
-Babe, I'll be right back,

46:39.057 --> 46:40.885
all right?

46:41.059 --> 46:43.583
If somethin' happens, just
flick the lights or somethin'.

47:03.429 --> 47:05.039
[car door thudding]

47:05.213 --> 47:07.737
[gravel crunching]

47:09.217 --> 47:10.958
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

47:13.134 --> 47:14.440
Come on, Eli.

47:18.444 --> 47:22.056
[cell phone buzzing]

47:30.760 --> 47:32.545
Fuck.

47:32.719 --> 47:33.981
[Eli] Yo-yo, this is Eli.
You know what to do.

47:34.155 --> 47:35.330
Eli, it's me.

47:36.114 --> 47:38.681
Call Shaina's phone as soon
as you get this message.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.118
Somebody's out here
fuckin' with us

47:40.292 --> 47:41.597
and we're about to bounce.

47:41.771 --> 47:43.208
I'mma try texting you.

47:46.994 --> 47:48.430
This piece of fuckin' shit.

47:51.216 --> 47:53.087
[car rumbling]

47:53.261 --> 47:54.306
Oh, shit.

48:03.881 --> 48:04.969
Did you recognize the car?

48:05.752 --> 48:06.796
No.

48:07.754 --> 48:09.451
Look,
just turn off all the lights

48:09.625 --> 48:10.888
and stay away
from the windows.

48:21.289 --> 48:22.856
You called Eli, didn't you?

48:23.857 --> 48:24.902
Yeah.

48:25.641 --> 48:27.556
But he, uh--
he didn't pick up.

48:29.645 --> 48:30.820
[Shaina] Sounds weird, but...

48:30.995 --> 48:32.300
I heard you calling him, Mark.

48:33.301 --> 48:35.260
From in here.
I heard you calling him.

48:36.957 --> 48:38.350
That doesn't make sense.
Are you sure?

48:38.524 --> 48:39.568
[Shaina] Call him again.

48:44.443 --> 48:46.184
Shh. Get-- get down.

48:58.065 --> 48:59.284
[knocking on door]

48:59.458 --> 49:00.938
[muffled voice] Hello?

49:02.983 --> 49:04.332
Sound like
the girl from earlier.

49:04.506 --> 49:07.074
-Taylor?
-[knocking on door]

49:07.248 --> 49:08.336
[muffled voice] Hello?

49:12.471 --> 49:13.515
[knocking on door]

49:16.954 --> 49:19.086
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, sorry.

49:19.260 --> 49:20.566
I didn't know
anyone was home.

49:20.740 --> 49:22.394
Uh, nah, it's all good,
we were, uh,

49:22.568 --> 49:25.179
just in the back
takin' a, uh, nap.

49:26.006 --> 49:27.138
Uh, come in, come in.

49:27.965 --> 49:29.488
I really didn't mean to
interrupt.

49:29.662 --> 49:31.533
It's just I can't
seem to find my car keys.

49:31.707 --> 49:33.405
Have you guys seen them?

49:33.579 --> 49:36.190
No, I, uh-- I haven't seen ca--
have you seen car keys?

49:36.364 --> 49:37.931
I haven't seen anything,
I'm sorry.

49:39.019 --> 49:40.412
Okay, thanks.
It was worth a shot.

49:40.586 --> 49:42.066
I'm just
gonna go check outside.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.024
[Shaina] No, wait.
Maybe you can help us.

49:44.198 --> 49:47.201
Um, when we got back,
Eli was gone, and...

49:48.202 --> 49:50.639
he's not picking up his phone,
so, I was just thinking,

49:50.813 --> 49:53.120
maybe since he was
with your friend--

49:53.294 --> 49:55.253
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you want me to text Chloe?

49:55.427 --> 49:57.429
-That would be great.
-Yeah, of course. No problem.

49:58.256 --> 50:00.519
Hey, uh, you, uh,
want some water or somethin'?

50:00.693 --> 50:01.737
Yeah, I'd love water.

50:02.303 --> 50:03.304
Thank you.

50:04.175 --> 50:06.612
[keyboard clacking]

50:10.529 --> 50:11.617
Hey.

50:13.793 --> 50:14.968
Are these yours?

50:16.230 --> 50:18.319
Oh, my gosh,
thank you so much.

50:20.756 --> 50:22.932
-You're a lifesaver.
-Where'd you find those?

50:24.586 --> 50:25.631
Just over there
on the counter.

50:27.502 --> 50:29.287
But Taylor, you didn't
come in here, did you?

50:31.028 --> 50:32.812
No, you guys
didn't bring them inside?

50:33.421 --> 50:36.033
[Mark] Um, maybe Eli.

50:37.121 --> 50:38.165
[cell phone buzzing]

50:39.427 --> 50:40.472
Oh, it's Chloe.

50:41.473 --> 50:42.909
Okay, she said,
"We're at drifters."

50:43.083 --> 50:44.606
Which is
a bar in town, so--

50:44.780 --> 50:46.260
And Eli's with her?

50:46.434 --> 50:47.957
[Taylor] Yes,
she said Eli is with her,

50:48.132 --> 50:50.134
but he's really
not feeling well.

50:50.308 --> 50:52.962
He's sick, so he's been
in the bathroom, I guess.

50:54.312 --> 50:55.530
[Mark] I mean,
that sound about right.

50:55.704 --> 50:57.184
Yeah.

50:57.358 --> 50:58.794
Uh, so-- so, I mean,
what you wanna do,

50:58.968 --> 51:00.144
you wanna wait for him here
or you wanna go

51:00.318 --> 51:01.623
-pick him up?
-I wanna go.

51:01.797 --> 51:03.016
We can find us
some cheapy hotel

51:03.190 --> 51:04.496
along the way,
I don't care.

51:04.670 --> 51:06.759
But this place
is freaking me out.

51:08.021 --> 51:09.979
All right, well, let's just
go pack up our things

51:10.154 --> 51:11.459
and we'll just
get him on the way out.

51:11.633 --> 51:12.678
Okay.

51:14.027 --> 51:15.115
Is everything all right?

51:15.681 --> 51:17.117
[Shaina] Yeah, it's just--

51:17.291 --> 51:18.597
I'm not used to
all this peace and quiet.

51:18.771 --> 51:19.946
It's just--

51:20.120 --> 51:21.600
it's kind of making me crazy,

51:21.774 --> 51:23.558
and so I think
we're just gonna cut this short

51:23.732 --> 51:24.646
and go home
a little early.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.257
Mm, okay.

51:26.431 --> 51:27.562
[knocking on door]

51:29.477 --> 51:30.826
Are you guys
expecting someone?

51:33.481 --> 51:34.569
No.

51:39.270 --> 51:41.010
[door creaks open]

51:43.665 --> 51:44.840
[Wingrad] Howdy, folks.

51:45.014 --> 51:46.364
I'm Sherriff Wingrad.

51:47.191 --> 51:49.236
I heard there was a disturbance
out here this evening.

51:49.410 --> 51:51.195
Yeah, yeah, that--
that was me.

51:55.634 --> 51:57.114
Taylor,
what are you doing here?

51:58.289 --> 51:59.725
I was hangin' out with Chloe.

52:00.291 --> 52:01.944
Did she ditch you again?

52:03.642 --> 52:04.817
When are you
gonna learn that girl

52:04.991 --> 52:06.166
only has
one thing on her mind?

52:06.340 --> 52:07.298
[Taylor] I know.

52:07.472 --> 52:09.430
[eerie music plays]

52:09.604 --> 52:11.867
All right.
What seems to be the problem?

52:13.173 --> 52:14.696
Um...

52:15.610 --> 52:17.351
somebody's been
messin' with us.

52:17.525 --> 52:18.700
Messin' how?

52:19.788 --> 52:21.790
Somebody was
watching us down by the fire.

52:23.096 --> 52:24.315
All right.

52:24.489 --> 52:25.881
Can you
describe 'em for me?

52:27.448 --> 52:30.147
It was dark,
and I only got a glimpse.

52:32.279 --> 52:33.411
What about you?

52:34.455 --> 52:36.849
Well, no, I mean,

52:37.023 --> 52:39.243
I actually--
I didn't see anything.

52:42.420 --> 52:45.988
So, you think you saw
somebody but you can't be sure.

52:47.555 --> 52:48.948
Mark, why don't you tell her

52:49.122 --> 52:50.558
about what you saw
down at the lake?

52:54.388 --> 52:55.955
It's probably best
if I show you.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.046
Lead the way.

53:01.221 --> 53:02.962
Taylor, do you think
you can keep an eye

53:03.136 --> 53:04.616
on that young lady
while we're gone?

53:04.790 --> 53:07.009
Yeah, not like I have
anywhere else to be.

53:07.749 --> 53:09.055
All right.

53:09.229 --> 53:10.883
Lock the door behind us,
just to be safe.

53:13.277 --> 53:14.321
All right, let's go.

53:16.541 --> 53:17.585
What'd I miss?

53:27.639 --> 53:28.683
Look. It was...

53:30.207 --> 53:31.251
it was over here.

53:33.514 --> 53:35.516
[mysterious music plays]

53:36.778 --> 53:37.823
Hey, watch it, watch it.

53:42.654 --> 53:43.698
What am I lookin' for?

53:44.656 --> 53:46.658
I-- I came down to get water

53:46.832 --> 53:48.312
to-- to put out the fire,
okay, and...

53:49.661 --> 53:51.228
I'm tellin' you,
it was a noise,

53:51.402 --> 53:52.838
or a splash
or somethin',

53:53.012 --> 53:55.188
and I shine my light
and it was right there.

53:55.362 --> 53:56.668
It was a fuckin' hand.

53:56.842 --> 53:59.540
[eerie chanting]

54:00.280 --> 54:02.369
I notice you kids
are having a little party

54:02.543 --> 54:03.588
back in the cabin.

54:04.589 --> 54:05.764
You take any drugs?

54:06.460 --> 54:08.506
I mean, I had
a couple beers, all right?

54:08.680 --> 54:11.552
But-- I know it sounds crazy,
but I know what I saw.

54:11.726 --> 54:13.162
It was
a severed hand in the water.

54:13.337 --> 54:14.773
[Wingrad] Okay, relax now.

54:14.947 --> 54:16.644
I'm not trying
to bust you, I'm just

54:16.818 --> 54:18.907
trying to figure out
what it is you really saw.

54:19.081 --> 54:22.737
[eerie chanting]

54:28.090 --> 54:29.178
Oh, shit.

54:30.919 --> 54:32.007
Yo...

54:33.313 --> 54:34.445
Fuck.

54:37.012 --> 54:38.362
[sighs]

54:38.536 --> 54:39.711
Do you wear
glasses or contacts?

54:41.800 --> 54:43.192
When I read, yeah.

54:43.367 --> 54:45.760
And did you
have 'em in earlier?

54:46.979 --> 54:49.111
-No.
-[Taylor] Okay.

54:49.286 --> 54:51.592
Chloe just said
that they're gonna head back

54:51.766 --> 54:53.333
once your friend is
good enough to ride in her car

54:53.507 --> 54:54.682
without getting too sick.

54:54.856 --> 54:56.554
[Shaina sighing]
Fuckin' asshole.

54:56.728 --> 54:58.033
Uh, in his defense,
no one ever says no to Chloe.

54:58.207 --> 54:59.905
I could see that.

55:00.079 --> 55:01.907
Eli made a joke that it must be
something in the water.

55:03.082 --> 55:04.823
It's more like
a limited gene pool.

55:04.997 --> 55:06.346
Everyone in Shady Grove
is related,

55:06.520 --> 55:08.087
which makes
dating a nightmare.

55:08.261 --> 55:09.871
It's also
really hard to stand out

55:10.045 --> 55:11.612
when everyone
looks the exact same.

55:12.439 --> 55:13.919
It's why I got the ink.
To stand out.

55:14.746 --> 55:16.878
-Do you wanna see?
-Sure.

55:27.367 --> 55:29.108
-[peaceful music plays]
-Check it out.

55:29.282 --> 55:31.458
[Shaina] Oh, my God.
It's amazing.

55:32.677 --> 55:34.026
[Taylor] I mean,
that's what everyone tells me,

55:34.200 --> 55:35.375
but I can't really
see it for myself.

55:37.116 --> 55:38.465
How long did it take?

55:41.076 --> 55:42.643
Took about a year, on and off.

55:42.817 --> 55:44.428
Basically whenever
I had money to pay for it.

55:45.167 --> 55:46.908
[Shaina] It looks painful.
Did it hurt?

55:47.822 --> 55:51.348
Not really, I mean,
it's kind of the point, right?

55:51.522 --> 55:53.219
Yeah, I guess.

55:54.002 --> 55:55.134
Do you have any tattoos?

55:55.308 --> 55:56.657
Yeah, just this little...

55:59.878 --> 56:01.662
I actually
got it with Eli.

56:04.970 --> 56:06.101
It's so cute.

56:07.320 --> 56:09.496
[Shaina] Mark used to
have this really tiny coupe.

56:09.670 --> 56:12.673
Um, and I'm-- mind you,
I'm super claustrophobic,

56:12.847 --> 56:14.632
so I refused
to sit in the back,

56:14.806 --> 56:16.634
and Eli
had to every single time.

56:16.808 --> 56:18.679
And so, he used to kick the
back of the seat and scream,

56:18.853 --> 56:20.986
"Oh, Shaina needs
