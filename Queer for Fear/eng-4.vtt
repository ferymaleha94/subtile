WEBVTT

00:08.249 --> 00:09.940
- I think there's
a great deal of

00:11.045 --> 00:13.322
our astonishment
when it is realized

00:13.323 --> 00:16.670
how much homosexuality
exists among women.

00:20.572 --> 00:21.848
You know, I think it's
something that people

00:21.849 --> 00:25.577
just don't believe is a
very great force at all.

00:35.587 --> 00:37.277
- The notion of the
predatory female

00:37.278 --> 00:39.624
has been present from
the beginning of cinema.

00:46.011 --> 00:47.356
- It's fascinating,

00:47.357 --> 00:50.532
the terror of women controlling
their own sexuality.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.747
- What are you thinking about?

00:58.748 --> 00:59.989
- The same thing you are.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.474
What else could I think about?

01:01.475 --> 01:04.235
- It upends our notions
of who is victim

01:04.236 --> 01:07.687
and who is victimizer
and who has the power

01:07.688 --> 01:09.861
and what that power looks like.

01:09.862 --> 01:10.725
- It's nice.

01:11.864 --> 01:15.039
- When you start to
explore female heroines

01:15.040 --> 01:17.283
who might also be the monster.

01:17.284 --> 01:20.009
We have to start
asking ourselves

01:20.010 --> 01:22.081
what's frightening
about femininity?

01:25.499 --> 01:26.740
- What's the biggest threat

01:26.741 --> 01:28.949
that the women are
sexually active,

01:28.950 --> 01:31.262
that they're sexually
active with one another,

01:31.263 --> 01:32.781
that they're independent, right?

01:32.782 --> 01:34.679
That you can't control them,
you can't commodify them,

01:34.680 --> 01:35.922
so what do you do?

01:35.923 --> 01:37.303
You turn that into
a figure of horror.

01:40.030 --> 01:42.722
- Just because one person
believes I'm the villain,

01:42.723 --> 01:46.139
they're wrong, but I am
the villain in their story

01:46.140 --> 01:50.730
and they're the villain in
mine and I'm right.

01:50.731 --> 01:53.905
- There's something
terrifying about movies

01:53.906 --> 01:58.877
where a fragile femininity
becomes something with teeth.

02:35.258 --> 02:37.570
- Men are fascinated by it.

02:37.571 --> 02:40.262
Even if they won't admit it,
they're utterly fascinated

02:40.263 --> 02:43.748
because they think, how can
a woman prefer another woman?

02:43.749 --> 02:46.165
They're not me. You know?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.512
- It's a sexual attraction
to a lot of men.

02:48.513 --> 02:50.928
- Hmm.
- They think the thought of

02:50.929 --> 02:54.690
two women together
is quite stimulating.

02:58.247 --> 03:01.594
- The notion of dooming
female alliances

03:02.699 --> 03:05.770
is a kind of
unconscious expression

03:05.771 --> 03:10.534
of the fear of established
power being taken away.

03:10.535 --> 03:12.915
The dyke is
a very selfish person.

03:12.916 --> 03:16.436
She's out to get all she
can and as often as she can.

03:16.437 --> 03:19.922
The dyke often takes on unjust
advantage of the young femme.

03:19.923 --> 03:21.545
After feeding her
drinks all night,

03:21.546 --> 03:22.891
she becomes very receptive

03:22.892 --> 03:25.204
to the dyke's
suggestions and advances.

03:27.828 --> 03:30.450
- The one character
that we have been given

03:30.451 --> 03:33.073
in bounty through the years
is the lesbian vampire.

03:35.870 --> 03:37.526
Which is great because
I mean, listen,

03:37.527 --> 03:40.047
who doesn't love a
good lesbian vampire?

03:44.362 --> 03:46.604
- Most lesbian vampire
films are either based

03:46.605 --> 03:50.608
on Carmilla or the story
of Elizabeth Bathory

03:50.609 --> 03:52.886
The Countess Elizabeth Bathory,

03:52.887 --> 03:55.130
esteemed member of
the royal family,

03:55.131 --> 03:57.960
convicted by holy
court of high crimes.

03:57.961 --> 04:00.756
Was she true and
malignant vampire

04:00.757 --> 04:03.345
filled with a feted
stench of death?

04:03.346 --> 04:07.798
Poor Countess Bathory.

04:07.799 --> 04:12.804
Elizabeth Bathory was the
countess in 16th century Hungary.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.945
She was put on trial for
murdering 500 young women

04:16.946 --> 04:18.878
from the surrounding villages.

04:18.879 --> 04:23.020
Although how she could murder
500 women and get away with it

04:23.021 --> 04:24.918
without anybody noticing

04:24.919 --> 04:28.025
in a small Hungarian
village escapes me.

04:29.614 --> 04:31.615
- There is some controversy

04:31.616 --> 04:33.651
if these events
actually took place

04:33.652 --> 04:36.171
or if this was really
about noble men

04:36.172 --> 04:38.794
trying to seize this
woman's property.

04:38.795 --> 04:42.660
- The countess is rumored
to have murdered young women

04:42.661 --> 04:44.697
to bathe in their blood

04:44.698 --> 04:47.838
because she thought that would
keep her young and beautiful.

04:47.839 --> 04:52.601
I think of her more
as someone who had

04:52.602 --> 04:56.018
irrepressible hungers for women

04:56.019 --> 04:59.608
and didn't really know
how to express them

04:59.609 --> 05:02.198
so she had to kill
them and consume them.

05:04.131 --> 05:07.789
Elizabeth Bathory inspired
many vampire legends,

05:07.790 --> 05:12.414
but I think of Carmilla as
the grandmother of Dracula

05:12.415 --> 05:15.659
and and subsequent
vampire fiction.

05:15.660 --> 05:17.316
- Carmilla.
- Carmilla.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.145
- Carmilla.

05:18.146 --> 05:19.352
Carmilla.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.010
- Carmilla is one of
the most prominent

05:22.011 --> 05:23.701
vampire novels ever written.

05:23.702 --> 05:26.117
It's what inspired Bram
Stoker to make Dracula.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.774
- Carmilla.

05:27.775 --> 05:29.328
Hold me.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.743
I beg you.

05:30.744 --> 05:32.883
Hold it me tight.

05:32.884 --> 05:37.612
- The greatest vampire in
literature would not exist

05:37.613 --> 05:41.650
if it weren't for a lesbian
vampire story first.

05:41.651 --> 05:43.203
- I actually read "Carmilla"

05:43.204 --> 05:45.689
before I saw any
lesbian vampire films.

05:45.690 --> 05:50.625
- "Carmilla" was one of my
favorite vampire stories

05:50.626 --> 05:53.282
and probably the one
I've read the most.

05:53.283 --> 05:55.250
- I personally love
the story of Carmilla

05:55.251 --> 05:57.666
because it was one
of the first times

05:57.667 --> 06:01.808
that I experienced
a lesbian storyline

06:01.809 --> 06:03.638
in a more classical setting

06:03.639 --> 06:08.644
and I think understanding
that this was a larger thing

06:09.507 --> 06:11.785
made me feel less othered.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.892
It made me feel seen.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.727
- It's a novella about
a very mysterious girl

06:23.728 --> 06:28.733
who's rescued when her carriage
crashes and she's taken in.

06:30.976 --> 06:34.047
- But Carmella is actually
this other worldly being

06:34.048 --> 06:39.053
that's going to suck the life
force out of our female hero.

06:40.158 --> 06:41.572
- So like even
from the beginning,

06:41.573 --> 06:42.746
like the sort of the
origin text of the vampire

06:42.747 --> 06:44.541
is this like deeply
lesbian book.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.267
- Why do you look
at me like that?

06:47.303 --> 06:49.304
- How beautiful you are.

06:49.305 --> 06:50.685
- Thank you.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.721
- But it was also a
novel of a predator

06:52.722 --> 06:54.413
and of like someone
sort of being hunted.

06:57.037 --> 07:00.729
- It's ultimately this
fear of the queer woman

07:00.730 --> 07:02.628
that's on display.

07:02.629 --> 07:03.457
- Come on.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.665
Afraid?
- Oh.

07:05.666 --> 07:10.429
- In "Carmilla" we see
the beginning tropes

07:10.430 --> 07:13.121
of the obsessive lesbian friend.

07:13.122 --> 07:15.572
- I thought this was
another nightmare.

07:15.573 --> 07:18.195
- You needn't worry
now. I'm here with you.

07:18.196 --> 07:20.749
- She has this very
intense relationship

07:20.750 --> 07:23.890
with the innocent virginal girl

07:23.891 --> 07:28.792
who then is tormented by
these fantasies of Carmilla.

07:28.793 --> 07:32.140
- The main character
experiences sex with Carmilla

07:32.141 --> 07:34.591
in the form of a giant
cat that comes to her

07:34.592 --> 07:36.006
and sits on her chest.

07:36.007 --> 07:38.111
The metaphor is
very obvious, right?

07:40.287 --> 07:42.599
Pussy.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.945
Everywhere.

07:43.946 --> 07:46.257
- My heart beat faster,

07:46.258 --> 07:50.399
my breathing rose and fell
rapidly and full drawn.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.334
A sobbing, that turned
into a dreadful convulsion

07:54.335 --> 07:57.615
in which my senses left me
and I became unconscious.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.791
- We were seeing a man
write about female desire

08:02.792 --> 08:06.726
without wanting to just
say it was an orgasm.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.939
- And it's also the first time
that we see the woman monster

08:12.940 --> 08:15.286
being associated with cats,

08:15.287 --> 08:17.219
which should become a
staple of the genre.

08:18.153 --> 08:20.050
At the end of the novella,

08:20.051 --> 08:22.915
she's defeated by the
male protagonists,

08:22.916 --> 08:26.021
which again is another trope
that's going to carry into

08:26.022 --> 08:28.784
almost all lesbian
vampire films.

08:31.027 --> 08:35.859
The first true lesbian vampire
film is "Dracula's Daughter,"

08:37.344 --> 08:40.588
which was one of the
last in the first cycle

08:40.589 --> 08:43.487
of original universal
monster movies

08:43.488 --> 08:48.423
that's outside of the
Carmilla/Elizabeth Bathory narrative.

08:48.424 --> 08:53.429
It sets up this existential
queer female vampire.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.776
- Why are you looking
at me that way?

08:56.708 --> 08:57.537
Won't I do?

08:58.710 --> 09:00.400
- Yes, you'll do
very well indeed.

09:00.401 --> 09:03.714
- The tagline of "Dracula's
Daughter" is quote,

09:03.715 --> 09:06.372
"She gives you that
weird feeling."

09:06.373 --> 09:08.547
So do what you will with
that information.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.170
- Do you like jewels, Lili?

09:11.447 --> 09:12.481
I'll show it to you.

09:12.482 --> 09:13.724
You have a woman

09:13.725 --> 09:15.899
who's experiencing
unnatural desires.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.314
- Please don't come
any closer! I...

09:22.078 --> 09:23.907
She's trying to
fight against it.

09:26.117 --> 09:28.152
- Freud had been writing
for a couple decades

09:28.153 --> 09:30.223
so by the 30s and 40s

09:30.224 --> 09:32.847
psychoanalysis is
everywhere in pop culture.

09:32.848 --> 09:34.711
- You'd all be interested
to know what modern science

09:34.712 --> 09:36.229
has to say about vampires.

09:36.230 --> 09:39.094
- Like any disease of the
mind, it can be cured.

09:39.095 --> 09:41.614
All we have to discover is what
brought about the obsession

09:41.615 --> 09:43.444
in order to affect
mental release.

09:44.549 --> 09:45.860
- Release?

09:45.861 --> 09:48.517
- Countess Zaleska
is seeking out ways

09:48.518 --> 09:52.383
to cure herself of
her ungodly urges.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.385
- The countess goes
to see a psychiatrist

09:54.386 --> 09:57.078
because she doesn't wanna
be a vampire anymore.

09:57.079 --> 10:00.082
- It came over me again,
that overpowering command,

10:01.290 --> 10:04.223
wordless, insistent,

10:04.224 --> 10:06.259
and I had to obey.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.089
- What was it?

10:09.747 --> 10:12.094
- I can't tell you it's too,

10:13.095 --> 10:15.614
too ghastly.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.409
- It's sad but it is the
story of like a queer person

10:18.410 --> 10:19.618
who does not wanna be queer,

10:19.619 --> 10:20.585
who's like really
trying to fight

10:20.586 --> 10:22.414
against their essential nature.

10:23.692 --> 10:24.899
- I'm thinking
about young people

10:24.900 --> 10:27.315
kind of questioning
their sexuality.

10:27.316 --> 10:31.112
All of the things someone
might try to make it stop.

10:31.113 --> 10:32.941
- In the name of the all holiest

10:32.942 --> 10:36.773
and through this cross be
the evil spirit cast out

10:36.774 --> 10:38.567
until the end of time.

10:39.777 --> 10:41.778
- Dracula died so she
thinks this curse,

10:41.779 --> 10:42.986
I'm free, it's lifted.

10:42.987 --> 10:44.781
- I can live a normal life now,

10:44.782 --> 10:48.129
think normal things, even
play normal music again.

10:48.130 --> 10:51.822
Listen.

10:51.823 --> 10:53.203
- It didn't work.

10:53.204 --> 10:55.654
And then lesbian power
move, gets a therapist.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.069
- There isn't anything
I won't do now

10:57.070 --> 10:58.622
to enlist your aid in freeing me

10:58.623 --> 11:01.143
of the curse of the Draculas.
- Draculas?

11:02.006 --> 11:02.869
- That doesn't work either. Why?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.386
'Cause she's gay.

11:04.387 --> 11:07.183
- The next time you feel this
influence, don't avoid it.

11:08.219 --> 11:09.633
Meet it.

11:09.634 --> 11:10.566
Fight it.

11:10.567 --> 11:12.049
- It's in you, baby girl.

11:12.050 --> 11:12.879
Like nothing's gonna stop it.

11:12.879 --> 11:13.707
- Stop!

11:14.674 --> 11:15.743
Stop!

11:15.744 --> 11:17.261
Stop!

11:17.262 --> 11:20.368
- We saw queer people at the
time of something to be fixed,

11:20.369 --> 11:24.337
something to be cured
and the parallel of that

11:24.338 --> 11:29.343
with this blood curse of being
a vampire is hard to ignore.

11:30.655 --> 11:33.174
- The psychiatry from
the 1930s has roots

11:33.175 --> 11:36.280
in what we now see with
conversion therapy.

11:36.281 --> 11:38.731
They were giving them
medication to feel ill

11:38.732 --> 11:40.664
and then showing
them what they desire

11:40.665 --> 11:43.218
as a way to try to
retrain their brain.

11:43.219 --> 11:44.944
This is still being done today

11:44.945 --> 11:46.913
to queer youth all
across the country.

11:48.362 --> 11:50.709
- I am somebody who went
through conversion therapy.

11:52.159 --> 11:55.196
I was sent to a pretty
insane facility in the desert

11:55.197 --> 11:58.095
and asked to change
everything about myself

11:58.096 --> 12:02.859
because I was "sick" and
I needed to be reformed

12:02.860 --> 12:06.103
and my queerness, my
mental health struggles

12:06.104 --> 12:07.656
were all used against me.

12:07.657 --> 12:10.349
And it's pretty much as close
to a real life horror film

12:10.350 --> 12:12.352
as I think many people can get.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.424
Films like "Dracula's Daughter"
resonate with queer people

12:16.425 --> 12:19.254
because growing up,
most of us are told

12:19.255 --> 12:22.706
that the space we
take up is not valid.

12:22.707 --> 12:24.673
Most of us are told
that we need to change

12:24.674 --> 12:29.231
or adapt or hide who we are
in order to fit into society.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.716
We know what it's like to
feel like we're not allowed

12:32.717 --> 12:35.408
to be ourselves and the
monster is telling us

12:35.409 --> 12:37.859
that we must change
and we are wrong.

12:42.002 --> 12:44.003
- So in 1936 when "Dracula
Daughter" comes out,

12:44.004 --> 12:47.662
Hollywood just started
enforcing the Production Code.

12:47.663 --> 12:49.422
- The Hays Code determines

12:49.423 --> 12:52.149
what can and cannot
be shown in movies.

12:52.150 --> 12:54.393
So if you're going to
show homosexuality,

12:54.394 --> 12:56.429
the homosexual must be punished.

12:59.123 --> 13:01.089
- Because of the Hays
Code, the queer can't live.

13:01.090 --> 13:04.610
The queer has to be dispatched
with, has to be murdered,

13:04.611 --> 13:07.440
has to be ended.
- The woman is beautiful.

13:07.441 --> 13:09.374
She was beautiful when she died

13:10.790 --> 13:14.794
100 years ago.

13:16.243 --> 13:18.003
- "Dracula's Daughter" is
actually looking forward

13:18.004 --> 13:20.799
to a lot of the
1940s horror films.

13:23.423 --> 13:25.251
That start to soften or mitigate

13:25.252 --> 13:26.597
what it means to be a monster.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.599
- There's something evil in me.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.187
- As far as the 40s go,

13:30.188 --> 13:32.983
I think the defining event
has to have been World War II.

13:32.984 --> 13:34.398
If you are 17,

13:34.399 --> 13:36.504
you can enlist in the
Air Corps Reserve.

13:38.093 --> 13:40.232
- With the bulk of
men going off to war,

13:40.233 --> 13:42.924
just imagine lesbian
relationships flourishing,

13:42.925 --> 13:45.651
all kinds of housewives
finding themselves

13:45.652 --> 13:46.964
when there's no men around.

13:48.137 --> 13:50.760
- It really rearranged
gender roles in America.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.039
- After the war,
Rosie the Riveter

13:54.040 --> 13:56.455
had to go back into the house.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.701
- It's coming from downstairs.

14:01.702 --> 14:04.256
- It comes from
everywhere and nowhere.

14:04.257 --> 14:07.190
- Women are haunted by the
specter of social expectations

14:07.191 --> 14:10.849
or by their own desires or
some combination of the two.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.989
Twas a
woman. I swear it.

14:12.990 --> 14:14.231
A ghost of a woman.

14:14.232 --> 14:15.992
- The horror films of that era,

14:15.993 --> 14:19.409
they often figure around
this central character

14:19.410 --> 14:21.583
of a ghostly woman
or a dead woman

14:21.584 --> 14:25.035
as another way to
nominate lesbian desire.

14:25.036 --> 14:27.210
- You have these
female presences

14:27.211 --> 14:29.385
exerting control from
beyond the grave.

14:30.593 --> 14:32.422
If you look at it from
a feminist perspective

14:32.423 --> 14:36.875
or a queer perspective, 1940s
lesbianism was just, you know,

14:36.876 --> 14:41.224
something that didn't
exist basically

14:41.225 --> 14:46.230
and when it did exist,
it was ghosts.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.852
- Like if she
doesn't have a body,

14:48.853 --> 14:50.889
then you don't have to worry
about her pursuing anyone.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.548
- If a woman could
get rid of her body,

14:55.549 --> 14:57.550
which really is the sight
of a lot of violence

14:57.551 --> 15:00.001
against a woman, man,
she could be scary

15:00.002 --> 15:02.141
and dangerous and powerful.

15:02.142 --> 15:04.005
- Historically, there's
this tremendous sense

15:04.006 --> 15:05.249
of lesbian invisibility.

15:06.836 --> 15:09.838
- The invisible
lesbian thing is huge,

15:09.839 --> 15:11.910
but I didn't see
myself represented

15:11.911 --> 15:13.808
in anything ever growing up.

15:13.809 --> 15:16.086
Like there was nothing
even remotely close

15:16.087 --> 15:19.952
that made me feel like, oh
okay, maybe this is what I am.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.574
- Lesbians are sort
of these specters

15:21.575 --> 15:23.093
that when you look
closely, like you squint,

15:23.094 --> 15:25.062
it's like there, there's
lesbians everywhere.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.857
- Sometimes when I walk
along the corridor,

15:28.858 --> 15:31.205
I fancy I hear her
just behind me.

15:31.206 --> 15:32.414
That quick light step.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.761
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.

15:35.762 --> 15:39.214
Not only in this room, it's
in all the rooms in the house.

15:40.422 --> 15:42.147
- What makes "Rebecca"
a lesbian ghost story

15:42.148 --> 15:44.839
is it's just about
women grappling

15:44.840 --> 15:47.221
with the specter of other women.

15:47.222 --> 15:49.016
- Do you think the dead come
back and watch the living?

15:49.017 --> 15:52.847
I don't believe it.

15:52.848 --> 15:53.642
- Sometimes,

15:55.230 --> 15:58.232
I wonder if she doesn't
come back here to Manderley,

15:58.233 --> 16:00.717
and watch you and Mr.
De Winter together.

16:00.718 --> 16:02.581
- Mrs. Danvers is
completely obsessed

16:02.582 --> 16:05.377
with the the dead
Mrs. De Winter.

16:05.378 --> 16:08.449
And you very much get a strong
reading that Mrs. Danvers

16:08.450 --> 16:10.589
is a homosexual and that
there might have been

16:10.590 --> 16:12.246
something between them.

16:12.247 --> 16:14.042
- I keep her underwear
on this side.

16:16.182 --> 16:17.976
They were made especially
for her by the nuns

16:17.977 --> 16:19.529
in the convent of St. Clair.

16:19.530 --> 16:20.840
- I don't know what
it is with lesbians,

16:20.841 --> 16:22.049
but we love nuns.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.396
We're like, "That's hot.
Thank you."

16:24.397 --> 16:28.193
- I watched you go down just
as I watched her a year ago.

16:28.194 --> 16:30.402
Even in the same dress
you couldn't compare.

16:30.403 --> 16:33.474
- "Rebecca" is about not
measuring up to femininity.

16:33.475 --> 16:34.993
There's this figure that exists,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.478
this high femme ghost or spirit

16:37.479 --> 16:40.515
exerting all this will
even though she's dead.

16:40.516 --> 16:41.930
And then the new bride

16:41.931 --> 16:43.829
who's never gonna
measure up to this woman.

16:43.830 --> 16:46.625
- Every day I, I realized
the things that she had

16:46.626 --> 16:48.627
and that I like.

16:48.628 --> 16:51.319
Beauty and wit and intelligence,

16:51.320 --> 16:54.909
and all the things that are
so important in a woman.

16:54.910 --> 16:58.119
- Rebecca needed someone
like Mrs. Danvers

16:58.120 --> 17:01.088
to feed the size of
ego that she had.

17:01.089 --> 17:03.849
And Dane was up for the job.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.506
- You thought you could
be Mrs. de Winter,

17:05.507 --> 17:07.197
live in her house,
walk in her steps,

17:07.198 --> 17:08.543
take the things that were hers,

17:08.544 --> 17:09.889
but she's too strong for you.

17:09.890 --> 17:11.339
You can't fight her.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.583
No one ever got the better
of her, never, never.

17:13.584 --> 17:16.172
- What is left if like
the person is gone

17:16.173 --> 17:19.623
and now the reputation and
the narrative has shifted,

17:19.624 --> 17:22.592
and you're left with
just like a broken heart

17:22.593 --> 17:24.318
and an empty shrine?

17:24.319 --> 17:25.836
You burn it down.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.116
- This is dangerous.
She's gone mad.

17:29.117 --> 17:30.841
She said she'd rather
destroy Manderley

17:30.842 --> 17:32.051
than see us happy here.

17:39.679 --> 17:42.301
- Gothic drama is about
the voiceless things

17:42.302 --> 17:43.820
gaining a voice.

17:43.821 --> 17:46.409
Like in "Rebecca" there's
like a person who's bringing

17:46.410 --> 17:49.101
the dead to life in this
sort of metaphorical way.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.621
And then you had a literal
bringing of the dead to life,

17:51.622 --> 17:53.278
you know, with actual ghosts.

17:55.004 --> 17:56.488
- Does it come every night?

17:56.489 --> 17:58.006
- No.

17:58.007 --> 18:00.699
Just when you begin to
think you dreamt it,

18:00.700 --> 18:03.805
it comes again.

18:03.806 --> 18:06.670
- In 1944, "The
Uninvited" premieres

18:06.671 --> 18:09.846
and you get to see
just how wonderful

18:09.847 --> 18:11.399
or horrible it
would be to find out

18:11.400 --> 18:13.401
that the ghost in your
house is a lesbian.

18:13.402 --> 18:15.714
- Do you think she
wants you there?

18:15.715 --> 18:18.027
- Yes, I think she does.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.996
- And what she wants, I want.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.827
- In "The Uninvited" you
have these two female ghosts

18:25.828 --> 18:28.761
who are vying for a
living woman's attention.

18:28.762 --> 18:31.005
There's the possibility
that one of those ghosts

18:31.006 --> 18:33.801
is the ex lover of
another woman in the film.

18:33.802 --> 18:35.285
Mary was a goddess.

18:35.286 --> 18:37.874
Her skin was radiant and
that bright, bright hair.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.462
- The way that women are
described by other women

18:39.463 --> 18:41.843
is so sort of
beautiful and singular,

18:41.844 --> 18:45.916
and it just feels like
this expression of desire.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.160
- The nights we've sat talking
in front of that fireplace,

18:48.161 --> 18:49.473
planning our whole lives.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.407
It wasn't flirtations and
dresses we talked about.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.237
We were no silly giggling girls.

18:56.549 --> 18:58.066
We intended to conquer life.

18:58.067 --> 19:00.724
- Repression is a theme
that we see constantly

19:00.725 --> 19:03.555
in films that are kind
of queer coded horror.

19:03.556 --> 19:06.213
- They shan't ever
find out, my darling.

19:06.214 --> 19:07.076
I promise you.

19:07.974 --> 19:09.802
- And then as the 60s proceed,

19:09.803 --> 19:11.114
these things don't have to be

19:11.115 --> 19:14.670
as couched in
metaphor necessarily.

19:16.085 --> 19:17.017
- You married?

19:18.433 --> 19:19.261
- No.

19:20.435 --> 19:21.987
- In Robert Wise's
"The Haunting",

19:21.988 --> 19:24.334
you have these people
in a haunted house

19:24.335 --> 19:26.336
dealing with the paranormal.

19:27.821 --> 19:30.789
- A haunted house movie is
always about the subconscious.

19:30.790 --> 19:33.240
It's always about
facing the things

19:33.241 --> 19:36.588
that you can only really
see in the dark of night.

19:36.589 --> 19:37.590
- The house.

19:39.039 --> 19:40.488
It's alive!

19:40.489 --> 19:42.732
- The haunted house
represents the mind

19:42.733 --> 19:43.974
of the protagonist,

19:43.975 --> 19:46.184
and the haunted side of
it is the shadow self.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.186
But it's all up,
it's all in here.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.188
It's all doing battle
with our own stuff.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.017
- Stop it!

19:53.813 --> 19:56.124
- Eleanor is a young woman
whose mother has just passed

19:56.125 --> 19:57.919
and she's never
known anything else.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.198
She's trying to figure out
where she belongs in the world

20:00.199 --> 20:02.752
and is like having a delayed
adolescence in a way.

20:02.753 --> 20:04.237
- I'd like to drink to, uh,

20:05.445 --> 20:08.724
to just us, good companions.
- Excellent.

20:10.588 --> 20:11.831
To my new companion.

20:13.142 --> 20:15.627
- Theo from "The
Haunting" is like all fur

20:15.628 --> 20:19.251
and leopard print and
turbans and leather gloves.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.805
She just comes out of the gate,

20:21.806 --> 20:26.465
balls to the wall, hitting
on Nell immediately.

20:26.466 --> 20:27.708
- If you're feeling
the least bit nervous

20:27.709 --> 20:29.503
just run right
into my room them.

20:29.504 --> 20:31.263
- Thanks. Goodnight.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.058
- She's on the rebound
basically and is like,

20:33.059 --> 20:34.887
I'm gonna pursue
Eleanor in this really

20:34.888 --> 20:36.820
like dogged and intense way.

20:36.821 --> 20:39.237
- We're going to be
great friends, Theo.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.997
- Like sisters?

20:40.998 --> 20:42.516
- Theo is a psychic.

20:42.517 --> 20:44.794
She can see inside her
and she knows what's up,

20:44.795 --> 20:46.797
and Nell is not
comfortable with it.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.695
- How did you know I
brought new clothes?

20:49.696 --> 20:52.457
- You wear your
thoughts on your sleeve.

20:52.458 --> 20:54.356
- Anyway, that's
better than my heart.

20:55.909 --> 20:59.015
- What this movie is about
underneath the surface

20:59.016 --> 21:01.707
is frankly her inability
to fully process

21:01.708 --> 21:03.778
a version of herself
that could be free

21:03.779 --> 21:06.022
and dare to engage
with the things

21:06.023 --> 21:08.990
that she's been sheltered
from within her own self.

21:08.991 --> 21:10.820
- I'd rather be
innocent than like you.

21:10.821 --> 21:12.442
- Meaning what?

21:12.443 --> 21:15.480
- There's another alternate
way of being a woman

21:15.481 --> 21:18.621
in front of her that
she so desperately needs

21:18.622 --> 21:20.554
to integrate and embrace.

21:20.555 --> 21:22.107
It is literally killing her.

21:22.108 --> 21:24.972
- The world is full
of inconsistencies

21:24.973 --> 21:27.008
on natural things.

21:27.009 --> 21:28.320
Nature's mistakes
they're called.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.288
You, for instance.

21:30.737 --> 21:32.981
- She does not understand
what's happening to her.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.190
It's like this thing that
can't quite come to the surface

21:36.191 --> 21:38.986
and so it's all about
sublimation and silence.

21:40.506 --> 21:43.404
- The house is coming
down around me,

21:43.405 --> 21:45.924
the house is destroying itself.

21:45.925 --> 21:48.064
- Every queer person has to face

21:48.065 --> 21:49.237
the weight of family pressure,

21:49.238 --> 21:50.963
the weight to social pressure.

21:50.964 --> 21:52.448
When we are
experiencing something

21:52.449 --> 21:54.829
that's not being mirrored
back to us by society,

21:54.830 --> 21:56.106
it's in our subconscious

21:56.107 --> 21:58.350
and it's bubbling up
in fleeting glimpses.

22:03.391 --> 22:05.115
- Eleanor doesn't get
to live long enough

22:05.116 --> 22:07.911
to fully understand what
it is she's experiencing,

22:07.912 --> 22:09.085
which is really sad.

22:09.086 --> 22:10.604
You know? It's
like really tragic.

22:10.605 --> 22:12.502
- Your house is haunted.

22:12.503 --> 22:14.262
Her poor, bedeviled mind

22:14.263 --> 22:15.920
wasn't strong
enough to fight it.

22:17.301 --> 22:21.684
- The ghost story gothic
of these dead women

22:21.685 --> 22:25.377
who won't go away, who
keep bothering people

22:25.378 --> 22:27.483
and don't they know
they just need to

22:27.484 --> 22:28.794
get out of the picture?

22:28.795 --> 22:30.244
And so you have films

22:30.245 --> 22:33.489
like "The Haunting"
or "The Uninvited,"

22:33.490 --> 22:36.043
literally "The Uninvited"

22:36.044 --> 22:39.391
who are, you know, daring
to make themselves known

22:39.392 --> 22:42.394
and visible even though
they don't serve the purpose

22:42.395 --> 22:44.534
that straight men see for them.

22:45.847 --> 22:47.088
- There was a gap really

22:47.089 --> 22:49.574
between "Dracula's
Daughter" in the 30s

22:49.575 --> 22:52.956
and the lesbian vampire
boobs of the 60s and 70s.

22:56.996 --> 22:58.997
- You know, we don't get just
the children's hour anymore.

22:58.998 --> 23:01.240
- Oh, I feel so
damn sick and dirty,

23:01.241 --> 23:03.933
I can't stand it anymore!

23:03.934 --> 23:05.797
- We don't just get
like miserable lesbians

23:05.798 --> 23:06.901
who kill themselves.

23:06.902 --> 23:08.386
- Oh.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.353
Oh.

23:09.354 --> 23:10.974
- That is the major difference,

23:10.975 --> 23:13.287
in the 1970s is we get sleaze.

23:17.982 --> 23:20.674
- What are you implying,
that Susan is a lesbian?

23:20.675 --> 23:23.780
- No, but she's been
dominated by a lesbian.

23:25.507 --> 23:28.509
- When we've move
into the 1970s,

23:28.510 --> 23:32.789
we come back to these
adaptations of Carmilla

23:32.790 --> 23:34.896
or the story of
Elizabeth Bathory.

23:36.069 --> 23:38.726
- Pre-film school, I
worked at Kim's Video

23:38.727 --> 23:42.040
on Bleecker Street, this
incredible video store.

23:43.283 --> 23:45.975
They'd have all these
bootlegs of every movie

23:45.976 --> 23:50.981
and so I would watch all these
1960s and 70s vampire movies.

23:51.844 --> 23:53.223
There was like a slew of those.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.915
- We've got a whole
bunch of films in France

23:54.916 --> 23:59.057
from Jean Rollin making
female vampires soft core.

23:59.058 --> 24:01.611
We've got crazy films
from Jes Franco.

24:03.303 --> 24:04.511
Probably the most well known,

24:04.512 --> 24:06.133
because they were
done in English,

24:06.134 --> 24:08.032
were the films from
Hammer Studios.

24:09.758 --> 24:11.345
- Don't you wish some
handsome young man

24:11.346 --> 24:12.795
would come into your life?

24:12.796 --> 24:14.072
- Hm.

24:14.073 --> 24:15.556
No, neither do you I hope.

24:15.557 --> 24:18.352
- We no longer had the vampires

24:18.353 --> 24:20.562
who were sexually repressed.

24:22.564 --> 24:24.669
No. Sexy vampires.

24:24.670 --> 24:26.672
It was sex, sex, sex.

24:29.260 --> 24:34.162
Lesbianism was very tied
in with being a vampire.

24:38.097 --> 24:39.649
- You're so beautiful, Mary.

24:39.650 --> 24:43.170
- Which was sexy but also
like the Harbinger of Doom.

24:44.931 --> 24:47.312
- Queer women were being used

24:47.313 --> 24:51.489
to get people horned up.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.940
- We must excite his desire.
- He'll awake soon.

24:54.941 --> 24:59.462
- Not only can they
literally devour men,

25:02.673 --> 25:06.850
but they can also seduce women
to join their unholy cabal.

25:10.439 --> 25:13.234
- Queer women's sexuality
is so often tied to power.

25:13.235 --> 25:15.443
- There's a cottage
in the woods.

25:15.444 --> 25:19.137
A young girl lives there alone,
refuses to take a husband.

25:19.138 --> 25:21.449
- And once you remove guys
from the equation entirely,

25:21.450 --> 25:22.761
it becomes something
that we find

25:22.762 --> 25:24.314
quote, unquote, "horrifying."

25:27.353 --> 25:29.457
- They prey on young virgins,

25:29.458 --> 25:30.459
put a spell on them.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.772
Sometimes they woo them.

25:35.672 --> 25:38.156
Slowly sucking their life away.

25:38.157 --> 25:40.158
Sometimes they kill quickly.

25:47.407 --> 25:50.169
One feast, one bite
of their fangs!

25:52.102 --> 25:53.827
- Well, that's alright.
I'm not a young virgin.

25:53.828 --> 25:56.795
- They're allowed to be
titillating and horrifying

25:56.796 --> 26:00.627
for ostensibly straight men
who in most of these cases,

26:00.628 --> 26:03.699
that's also who is writing
and directing these movies.

26:06.461 --> 26:07.979
- Why are the
lesbians all feminine?

26:07.980 --> 26:10.878
I would think largely because
the people consuming them

26:10.879 --> 26:14.744
are men, and men don't have
much use for a masculine woman.

26:14.745 --> 26:16.366
They have a lot of use
for a feminine woman

26:16.367 --> 26:19.370
and they have even more use for
two feminine women together.

26:20.717 --> 26:23.235
- I'm like you can't be a
lesbian with those fingernails.

26:23.236 --> 26:24.962
I mean you can, but like...

26:26.688 --> 26:28.448
You're not gonna
be finger banging.

26:30.278 --> 26:33.176
- Lesbian sexuality
unless it is specifically

26:33.177 --> 26:35.558
filtered through
horn aimed at men,

26:35.559 --> 26:37.802
it is not visible to men

26:37.803 --> 26:40.425
except as like a
shadow on the wall.

26:40.426 --> 26:42.151
- It's so interesting
that, you know,

26:42.152 --> 26:43.601
it's like men make these movies

26:43.602 --> 26:46.189
thinking that it's
like hot for them,

26:46.190 --> 26:48.571
but sorry, you put
hot women in it

26:48.572 --> 26:50.712
so lesbians are
gonna like it too.

26:52.162 --> 26:54.888
- You can apply a
read to these films

26:54.889 --> 26:57.166
where they are the
reaction against

26:57.167 --> 26:59.617
the early waves of
feminism that were emerging

26:59.618 --> 27:01.480
in the late 60s and 70s.

27:01.481 --> 27:03.759
- What we are talking about

27:03.760 --> 27:07.038
is a revolution
and not a reform.

27:07.039 --> 27:09.627
- There has been proposed
a constitutional amendment

27:09.628 --> 27:11.490
to guarantee equal
rights for women.

27:11.491 --> 27:14.079
Male opponents in the
Senate said it would destroy

27:14.080 --> 27:17.738
traditional man/woman relationships,
weaken family ties,

27:17.739 --> 27:19.567
increased homosexuality.

27:19.568 --> 27:21.362
- How do we fix
that? Oh, I know.

27:21.363 --> 27:25.850
We portray the actualized
woman as being a monster.

27:25.851 --> 27:27.852
- Kill him! Kill him now!

27:27.853 --> 27:30.302
Get closer to him!
Slash his face!

27:30.303 --> 27:31.752
Find his heart and cut it out.

27:31.753 --> 27:34.030
Silence him! Destroy
his masculinity!

27:34.031 --> 27:36.308
- This is what happens, men,

27:36.309 --> 27:38.966
when women start having
sex with other women,

27:38.967 --> 27:41.693
it is devastatingly
destructive to men.

27:43.316 --> 27:45.732
- "Daughters of
Darkness" is one of those

27:45.733 --> 27:48.804
lesbian vampire films
that really stands out.

27:48.805 --> 27:50.013
- Who do you think I am?

27:51.014 --> 27:53.257
A kind of ghoul? A vampire?

27:54.707 --> 27:56.019
Oh no my dear.

27:57.641 --> 28:00.747
I'm just an outmoded
character, nothing more.

28:00.748 --> 28:02.369
You know, the
beautiful stranger,

28:02.370 --> 28:06.028
slightly sad,
slightly mysterious.

28:06.029 --> 28:07.339
- The lesbian
vampire goes on these

28:07.340 --> 28:10.446
like feminist monologues.

28:10.447 --> 28:13.138
- Stephan loves me
whatever you may think.

28:13.139 --> 28:15.175
- Stephan loves me
whatever you may think.

28:15.176 --> 28:17.315
Of course he does.

28:17.316 --> 28:19.489
That's why dreams
he making out of you

28:19.490 --> 28:23.355
what every man dreams of
making out of every woman,

28:23.356 --> 28:27.497
a slave, a thing, an
object for pleasure.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.568
- It stars Delphine Seyrig,

28:29.569 --> 28:33.469
European actress and
an outspoken feminist.

28:53.835 --> 28:56.872
She uses mad sensibility
in her portrayal

28:56.873 --> 28:58.805
of Countess Bathory.

28:58.806 --> 29:01.773
- I am a man and she is mine.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.188
- Was she yours last night?

29:03.189 --> 29:05.397
Would he be yours if
you let go of her now?

29:06.848 --> 29:09.919
- At the end of the film,
Elizabeth Bathory died

29:13.199 --> 29:15.580
and you think, okay, it's
gonna just sort of end

29:15.581 --> 29:18.272
like a typical
lesbian vampire film.

29:18.273 --> 29:23.070
But Valerie has now taken on
the persona of the countess.

29:23.071 --> 29:23.900
- I can't tell you how much
I despise this kind of place

29:23.901 --> 29:25.660
this guide the place,

29:29.043 --> 29:32.459
especially now when
there's no one.

29:32.460 --> 29:36.635
- So it really points
to this shared legacy

29:36.636 --> 29:39.362
of queerness being passed down

29:39.363 --> 29:41.434
from generation to generation.

29:43.402 --> 29:46.093
There really isn't
another film like that

29:46.094 --> 29:47.819
except for "The Hunger."

29:52.066 --> 29:54.757
- It imagines the monstrous

29:54.758 --> 29:59.211
as a kind of expression of
high fashion sensibility.

30:00.695 --> 30:02.627
- My favorite lesbian vampire
movie is "The Hunger."

30:02.628 --> 30:04.940
- It is so essentially 80s.

30:04.941 --> 30:07.459
- First thoughts of "The Hunger"
were just like, Oh my God,

30:07.460 --> 30:09.634
this is so sexy, this is so hot.

30:09.635 --> 30:10.877
I want to be in there.

30:10.878 --> 30:13.672
- They are all just
bisexual disasters.

30:13.673 --> 30:16.020
- All this heterosexual
drama doesn't matter anymore.

30:16.021 --> 30:20.679
Like what's happening here?
I want in on this.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.820
- There's this premise
of the scary bisexual

30:22.821 --> 30:24.787
because they're out to get you,

30:24.788 --> 30:26.754
but they're out to get
everybody else also.

30:26.755 --> 30:30.103
- Susan Sarandon and
Catherine Deneuve, come on.

30:30.104 --> 30:33.554
Come, and David fucking Bowie!

30:33.555 --> 30:38.111
Come on. That movie
changed my life.

30:38.112 --> 30:39.975
- What have you done to me?

30:39.976 --> 30:42.770
- I've given you something
you never dared dream of.

30:42.771 --> 30:45.118
- What?
- Everlasting Life.

30:45.119 --> 30:49.260
- Miriam Blaylock
is the culmination

30:49.261 --> 30:53.264
of the lesbian
vampires of the 1970s.

30:53.265 --> 30:55.474
- Miriam does think
at her in lesbian.

30:56.682 --> 30:58.372
There's a scene,
Catherine Deneuve

30:58.373 --> 31:00.996
just kind of standing there
in a veil looking amazing

31:00.997 --> 31:03.481
and she thinks
lesbianonic thoughts.

31:03.482 --> 31:04.965
It's Susan Sarandon.

31:04.966 --> 31:07.726
And then Susan Sarandon like,
she looks up and she's like.

31:07.727 --> 31:09.004
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

31:09.005 --> 31:10.764
- And Catherine Deneuve's like.

31:10.765 --> 31:13.250
- Nothing, but I would
like to talk to you.

31:14.631 --> 31:16.494
- Uh, uh, yes, I'd like that.

31:16.495 --> 31:20.878
- I thought that was such
a cool take on vampirism.

31:20.879 --> 31:25.884
The seduction was just this
kind of lesbian telepathy.

31:26.988 --> 31:29.957
It was this idea of
it's a mind thing first.

31:32.166 --> 31:33.615
- I don't know why I'm here.

31:34.513 --> 31:36.031
- Come in.

31:36.032 --> 31:40.276
And then of course the really
hot sex scene.

31:42.970 --> 31:45.419
- What's that
piece your playing?

31:45.420 --> 31:46.869
- It's "Lakme" by Delibes.

31:46.870 --> 31:48.733
- Can we talk about
the Coloratura

31:48.734 --> 31:50.873
Meso Soprano duet from "Lakme"?

31:53.187 --> 31:54.153
- Is it a love song?

31:56.017 --> 31:56.845
- I told you.

31:57.743 --> 31:58.917
It was sung by two women.

32:00.539 --> 32:02.126
- Sounds like a love song.

32:02.127 --> 32:03.921
- Then I suppose
that's what it is.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.130
- Da, da, da, da, da.

32:06.131 --> 32:10.789
Yeah. Every time a lesbian
vampire has sex, they play that.

32:12.861 --> 32:17.383
- "The Hunger" is the first
lesbian sex scene I ever saw.

32:18.798 --> 32:19.971
- There's like a moment where

32:19.972 --> 32:21.317
like she's kinda
sucking on her wrist

32:21.318 --> 32:23.148
and it felt really like,

32:24.943 --> 32:26.565
I know what I'm looking at here.

32:27.704 --> 32:32.156
- Miriam, she really
is like a vampire mommy

32:32.157 --> 32:36.539
who's inducting Susan
Sarandon into this world

32:36.540 --> 32:39.715
through the exchange
of blood and ritual.

32:39.716 --> 32:41.786
- "The Hunger" is fascinating

32:41.787 --> 32:46.792
because it purports to be
celebrating homosexual desire,

32:47.655 --> 32:48.896
but when you really look at it,

32:48.897 --> 32:49.864
the straight men
are duplicating this

32:49.865 --> 32:51.416
for their own satisfaction.

32:51.417 --> 32:55.075
Until you go into a lesbian
bar and we see "The Hunger"

32:55.076 --> 32:57.146
and we know that
they're basically

32:57.147 --> 32:58.977
just kind of ripping
off our culture.

33:00.495 --> 33:03.739
We've all been trained
to find ourselves

33:03.740 --> 33:05.016
in these narratives.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.225
We found ourselves.

33:08.538 --> 33:10.849
- We're damned to live forever.

33:10.850 --> 33:12.852
With no release, no end.

33:15.683 --> 33:17.960
And I need you to
share it with me.

33:17.961 --> 33:21.170
- "The Hunger", ugh, lesbian
seduction at its finest.

33:21.171 --> 33:24.070
And also, the reality
that lesbians,

33:24.071 --> 33:26.901
we are just gonna be stuck
in eternity next to our exes.

33:27.833 --> 33:30.145
- All of you, all my loves.

33:30.146 --> 33:33.320
Surrounded by them.

33:33.321 --> 33:34.426
Just forever.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.739
What keeps coming up
in each of these movies

33:38.740 --> 33:42.226
is like once you go dyke,

33:42.227 --> 33:44.090
maybe you'll start
enjoying sex for once.

33:44.091 --> 33:46.747
Like that's what keeps
happening every single time

33:46.748 --> 33:51.580
is that these women are
like, oh, this is it.

33:51.581 --> 33:54.824
- It's not nearly as difficult
as you imagined, is it?

33:56.620 --> 33:58.552
- "The Hunger" just
took that genre

33:58.553 --> 34:01.866
and went phew out to the,
you know, just skyrocketed.

34:01.867 --> 34:04.351
But my absolute favorite,
"Lair of the White Worm."

34:10.634 --> 34:15.328
Amanda Donohoe straps
on the biggest dildo

34:15.329 --> 34:17.985
I have ever seen in my life.

34:17.986 --> 34:20.540
It was like a Buick.
She strapped on a Buick.

34:20.541 --> 34:24.233
There's this virgin
quivering on the altar

34:24.234 --> 34:28.893
as they do this, she's
stepping closer and closer

34:28.894 --> 34:33.242
with his Buick strapped on.

34:33.243 --> 34:36.349
It's the campiest greatest
thing I've ever seen.

34:38.490 --> 34:41.492
- What vampire movies allow for

34:41.493 --> 34:45.427
is a celebration of
morality-free sexuality.

34:45.428 --> 34:47.118
- Bet your girlfriend
doesn't do this for you.

34:47.119 --> 34:50.397
- Nah. Nor me Mum neither.

34:50.398 --> 34:52.468
- Oh, I remind you
of your mother, do I?

34:52.469 --> 34:53.918
- And for the most part,

34:53.919 --> 34:55.989
people are terrified
of that notion.

34:55.990 --> 34:56.853
- I give you

34:58.648 --> 35:01.513
Katrina!

35:03.860 --> 35:07.621
- "Vamp" is a very interesting
gem of a vampire film

35:07.622 --> 35:10.624
because it's set at
a vampire strip club.

35:12.386 --> 35:14.559
Sex work is a huge
part of queer history

35:14.560 --> 35:18.011
and what's interesting about
"Vamp" is that sex work

35:18.012 --> 35:21.014
and vampirism is linked.

35:21.015 --> 35:25.364
That shows a sex worker being
in control of the situation,

35:26.434 --> 35:28.125
which is itself also very queer.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.128
- Oh my God! "Vamp"!

35:31.129 --> 35:32.129
- Wow.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.475
"Vamp" and Grace Jones.

35:33.476 --> 35:34.615
- Grace Jones.

35:36.030 --> 35:38.307
Icon.
- Oh, Grace Jones.

35:38.308 --> 35:42.346
- Men love Grace Jones and
women love Grace Jones.

35:42.347 --> 35:44.969
What could Grace Jones
really have done

35:44.970 --> 35:46.557
if she wasn't an icon?

35:46.558 --> 35:48.593
- Grace Jones, can I
please talk, oh my God.

35:48.594 --> 35:51.149
When she comes out.

35:57.362 --> 36:01.848
- In the middle of that film
was this performance art piece.

36:01.849 --> 36:03.850
It seemed like
Grace Jones came in

36:03.851 --> 36:05.369
and did that part of the movie.

36:05.370 --> 36:06.922
When you see her, she's white,

36:06.923 --> 36:10.063
like she is white, white,
white and with blue eyes.

36:10.064 --> 36:12.479
Then she starts to strip,

36:12.480 --> 36:16.794
she's doing a strip tease of
her whiteness to blackness.

36:16.795 --> 36:18.727
She's basically like exposing

36:18.728 --> 36:21.626
actually you've been
watching a black woman

36:21.627 --> 36:23.214
doing this dance for you.

36:23.215 --> 36:25.975
It was such an
arresting, provocative

36:25.976 --> 36:27.908
piece of performance
art that just seemed

36:27.909 --> 36:30.808
totally out of place
in the best way

36:30.809 --> 36:32.569
in this super goofy movie.

36:33.743 --> 36:35.882
- I remember walking
into the dressing room

36:35.883 --> 36:37.987
and there was Grace Jones,

36:37.988 --> 36:39.851
and she was completely naked

36:39.852 --> 36:43.855
and Keith Haring was drawing
white lines all over her body.

36:43.856 --> 36:46.755
I got a chance to just
sit and watch them draw

36:46.756 --> 36:48.722
and I always
remember that moment.

36:48.723 --> 36:52.174
Keith Haring was a
artist, an AIDS activist,

36:52.175 --> 36:56.005
and he was really fundamental
in bringing out the issue

36:56.006 --> 36:58.145
when everybody was
dealing with aids.

36:58.146 --> 37:00.596
- We have this incredibly
important piece

37:00.597 --> 37:04.566
of queer art history with the
Keith Haring body painting

37:04.567 --> 37:07.776
on Grace Jones that
elevates the film

37:07.777 --> 37:09.778
into an artistic space.

37:10.780 --> 37:12.125
- She's, I, I...

37:14.715 --> 37:16.854
- There's not a lot of
women that I've seen

37:16.855 --> 37:18.580
that are my color complexion

37:18.581 --> 37:21.549
and chocolate like
me in a strong role.

37:22.550 --> 37:24.068
She was also androgynous.

37:24.069 --> 37:25.933
She was kind of
fucking with gender.

37:27.314 --> 37:29.211
- Grace Jones might as well
have been a gay vampire

37:29.212 --> 37:30.695
in real actual life.

37:30.696 --> 37:34.043
She moved through the world
with that confusing blend

37:34.044 --> 37:35.769
of masculine/feminine energy.

37:35.770 --> 37:39.014
- She had very powerful
feminine but very powerful male.

37:39.015 --> 37:41.292
She had both of
those entities to me.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.225
- There's these almost monstrous

37:43.226 --> 37:47.505
but kind of beautiful displays
of genderless queer power.

37:47.506 --> 37:48.748
- As a young person,

37:48.749 --> 37:50.784
I felt very out of my
element gender-wise,

37:50.785 --> 37:53.373
like I felt like, hey, I
really like being a girl,

37:53.374 --> 37:55.306
but like sometimes people
don't think I'm a girl

37:55.307 --> 37:58.930
and that makes me feel
really scared or ashamed.

37:58.931 --> 38:00.587
There was something
about the way

38:00.588 --> 38:03.280
Grace Jones carried herself.

38:03.281 --> 38:07.111
It made me feel like
I was less weird.

38:07.112 --> 38:10.010
- She has the testosterone
of like 10,000 men

38:10.011 --> 38:13.738
as well as the estrogen
of maybe 9,000 women.

38:13.739 --> 38:15.292
- Does that make you bisexual?

38:15.293 --> 38:19.710
- I think that it's ridiculous
trying to categorize

38:19.711 --> 38:23.783
people's feelings or saying
what does one prefer.

38:23.784 --> 38:25.647
There's no comparison.

38:25.648 --> 38:27.718
You can't just say one's
better than the other

38:27.719 --> 38:30.583
or one's worse than the other,
I prefer one to the other.

38:30.584 --> 38:32.654
It's just do what you feel

38:32.655 --> 38:35.173
when you feel like it
if you feel like it.

38:44.149 --> 38:44.977
- Black widow.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.153
She mates and she kills.

38:52.019 --> 38:53.951
- In the late 80s/early 90s

38:53.952 --> 38:58.093
you see this reemergence
of the film noir heroine

38:58.094 --> 39:00.268
or the vamp if you will.

39:03.789 --> 39:07.759
But you see her from the
perspective of female rage.

39:14.869 --> 39:16.422
- Really starting
to piss me off.

39:16.423 --> 39:19.908
- The overarching
conservatism of the Reagan era

39:19.909 --> 39:22.048
was bad for queer
people in general,

39:22.049 --> 39:23.912
but bad for women specifically.

39:23.913 --> 39:27.778
- There's this real concern
in the backlash of feminism

39:27.779 --> 39:30.815
that women are
essentially too angry.

39:32.853 --> 39:34.647
- You watch your mouth, buddy.

39:34.648 --> 39:36.269
- So suddenly it was like, well,

39:36.270 --> 39:38.444
we'll make the lesbians
the villains for a while

39:38.445 --> 39:39.859
and see how that goes.

39:45.590 --> 39:47.245
- The 90s were kind of vicious.

39:50.768 --> 39:53.425
Lesbian chic vicious.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.290
- Lesbian chic, for those
of you that don't know,

39:57.291 --> 40:01.570
is when lesbians became
very, very popular

40:01.571 --> 40:04.331
within pop culture in America.

40:04.332 --> 40:07.093
- All of a sudden everyone's
doing a lesbian thing.

40:07.094 --> 40:09.302
So it was sort of exciting
but at the same time

40:09.303 --> 40:11.408
it was like, what's happening?

40:14.515 --> 40:17.517
- The characters were
supposed to be lesbians,

40:17.518 --> 40:19.243
but they weren't
written by lesbians,

40:19.244 --> 40:20.762
they weren't
directed by lesbians

40:20.763 --> 40:23.350
and they certainly weren't
being played by lesbians.

40:23.351 --> 40:26.044
So we were raised from
our own narrative.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.944
- Like there had
been some thievery.

40:30.945 --> 40:34.983
- There was some desire
to see bisexual women

40:34.984 --> 40:39.021
and see an expression of a
kind of sexual liberation,

40:39.022 --> 40:43.993
but there also had to be a
villainizing of that liberation.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.651
- What's your new book about?

40:50.102 --> 40:52.933
- A detective. He falls
for the wrong woman.

40:57.524 --> 40:59.248
- What happens?

40:59.249 --> 41:01.527
She kills him.

41:01.528 --> 41:04.288
- "Basic Instinct"
comes out in 1992,

41:04.289 --> 41:07.325
and in that film we
see the lesbian vampire

41:07.326 --> 41:11.260
transformed into the
dangerous femme fatale.

41:11.261 --> 41:15.369
The character of Catherine
Tramell is this shifty bisexual

41:17.267 --> 41:20.684
who pierces men
with her phallus.

41:28.831 --> 41:30.279
- I remember seeing
"Basic Instinct"

41:30.280 --> 41:31.798
and getting really excited
'cause oh, finally,

41:31.799 --> 41:34.076
there's like a, you know,
a bisexual on the screen.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.429
- You get to see this character

41:42.430 --> 41:45.985
who seems complex and in a
relationship with this woman.

41:45.986 --> 41:46.745
Hi.

41:48.057 --> 41:49.954
- But that
relationship is clearly

41:49.955 --> 41:51.785
just meant for the male gaze.

41:54.409 --> 41:55.926
And is very throwaway.

42:01.691 --> 42:03.520
Roxy?

42:03.521 --> 42:08.526
- There's a depiction of
heartless bisexuals in in the movie

42:09.906 --> 42:12.529
that seemed to me actually kind
of reactionary at the time.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.013
- You didn't feel
anything for him,

42:14.014 --> 42:16.049
you just had sex with
him for your book?

42:16.050 --> 42:17.017
- In the beginning.

42:18.190 --> 42:20.019
Then I got to like
what he did for me.

42:20.020 --> 42:24.333
- I actually remember having
to cross a picket line

42:24.334 --> 42:25.714
to go see "Basic Instinct"

42:25.715 --> 42:29.062
and having very conflicted
feelings about it.

42:29.063 --> 42:31.099
But I also really wanted
to see this movie.

42:35.035 --> 42:36.898
- My friends were protesting
outside of screenings,

42:36.899 --> 42:40.177
so I actually snuck with
another friend of mine

42:40.178 --> 42:42.628
to a different
neighborhood to go see it.

42:45.390 --> 42:48.323
- Even if it's this sort
of unflattering portrayal

42:48.324 --> 42:50.187
of who we are, we're
just so excited

42:50.188 --> 42:52.292
to see ourselves
that there's no way

42:52.293 --> 42:54.363
you can't identify with it.

42:54.364 --> 42:55.882
- Not that we can't
also be murderers.

42:55.883 --> 42:58.298
I know some perfectly
horrible homosexuals.

43:03.028 --> 43:06.548
It's just that there's not a
movie playing in the cinema

43:06.549 --> 43:09.689
next door where Catherine
Tramell and Roxy

43:09.690 --> 43:12.968
just like have cute
dinner parties, you know?

43:12.969 --> 43:14.487
Meh!

43:14.488 --> 43:16.040
- We just need more
representation.

43:16.041 --> 43:19.181
- People really love to get
mad about queer villains,

43:19.182 --> 43:20.631
but I find queer villains

43:20.632 --> 43:23.841
to be tremendously
powerful and interesting.

43:23.842 --> 43:25.223
- Somebody has to die.

43:26.983 --> 43:27.812
- Why?

43:29.848 --> 43:31.332
- Somebody always does.

43:32.644 --> 43:35.853
- "Basic Instinct"
is very successful.

43:37.373 --> 43:41.583
And unleashes a slew
of bisexual killers

43:41.584 --> 43:43.621
in films like "Poison Ivy",

43:45.139 --> 43:46.623
"Wild Things",

43:48.556 --> 43:50.524
and "Single White Female."

43:58.912 --> 44:00.740
- You've gotta be kidding.

44:00.741 --> 44:03.156
- In the 90s you
see queer characters

44:03.157 --> 44:05.020
wanting to take over the bodies

44:05.021 --> 44:07.954
or the lives of
the protagonists.

44:10.924 --> 44:14.512
You can track that
back to Carmilla,

44:14.513 --> 44:19.518
the stranger that shows up
at the doorstep of our hero

44:20.692 --> 44:24.522
and begins to suck
away her identity.

44:24.523 --> 44:26.111
- I love myself like this.

44:27.112 --> 44:28.630
- I really wanna do that.

44:28.631 --> 44:31.771
I just wanna move in with
someone and become them.

44:31.772 --> 44:34.878
- Anything of mine that
you want, just go ahead.

44:34.879 --> 44:36.396
Share and share alike.

44:36.397 --> 44:40.090
- There's this push and pull
of do I wanna be with you?

44:40.091 --> 44:41.574
Do I want to be you?

44:41.575 --> 44:44.922
Am I in league with you or
am I in competition with you?

44:44.923 --> 44:47.649
- Ah!
- And how painful

44:47.650 --> 44:49.133
the confusion of that is.

44:49.134 --> 44:49.963
- No.

44:58.316 --> 44:59.972
- I mean, I remember watching
"Single White Female"

44:59.973 --> 45:02.388
and thinking this is the
most homophobic movie

45:02.389 --> 45:04.631
I've ever seen in
my entire life.

45:05.979 --> 45:08.877
How could you do that?

45:08.878 --> 45:10.189
Everything I've done,
I've done for you.

45:10.190 --> 45:11.708
Don't you understand that?

45:11.709 --> 45:15.677
- But it also feels real in
this like very interesting way

45:15.678 --> 45:18.887
where it's like this desire as
this like obliterating force.

45:25.308 --> 45:27.585
- When I first sought
"Mulholland Drive"

45:27.586 --> 45:30.968
I was 20 years old

45:30.969 --> 45:35.835
and I left that theater thinking

45:35.836 --> 45:37.803
I'm a lesbian.

45:37.804 --> 45:42.809
And then I didn't come out
for 14 more years.

45:43.982 --> 45:45.155
- Camilla.

45:45.156 --> 45:47.709
- Like "Basic Instinct",
"Mulholland Drive"

45:47.710 --> 45:50.332
comes out of the
Carmilla narrative.

45:53.060 --> 45:57.477
It's very much a contemporary
perverse re-imagining

45:57.478 --> 46:01.654
of the mysterious woman
crashing by the side of the road

46:01.655 --> 46:04.762
and being taken
in by an innocent.

46:05.659 --> 46:07.074
- Where were you hurt?

46:09.490 --> 46:13.183
- "Mulholland Drive"
is a series of scenes

46:13.184 --> 46:14.978
that happen twice.

46:14.979 --> 46:18.844
Once in an idealized dream
life and once in reality.

46:20.294 --> 46:22.192
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

46:22.193 --> 46:23.607
- We don't stop here.
- We don't stop here.

46:25.092 --> 46:28.785
- As viewers, you're second
guessing your own experience.

46:33.273 --> 46:37.000
I can't think of a better
analogy cinematically

46:37.001 --> 46:41.074
for what it's like to
be gay and not know yet.

46:42.420 --> 46:45.733
Have you ever done this before?

46:46.631 --> 46:47.459
- I don't know.

46:48.875 --> 46:49.737
Have you?

46:51.912 --> 46:53.879
- You have the one experience

46:53.880 --> 46:57.192
of externally
walking through life.

46:57.193 --> 46:59.816
- Hi, I'm Diane Selwyn.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.266
- And then there's
also the internal life.

47:02.267 --> 47:04.787
- My name's Betty.
- No, it's not.

47:06.168 --> 47:10.309
- That is in constant conflict
with the world around you.

47:10.310 --> 47:14.727
What I think is so deeply
touching about the film

47:14.728 --> 47:17.730
is the idea that there
is this idealized

47:17.731 --> 47:19.284
female relationship.

47:20.216 --> 47:21.804
- Good night, sweet Betty.

47:23.910 --> 47:27.913
- This moment of recognizing
deep love for one another.

47:27.914 --> 47:31.331
Good night.

47:35.128 --> 47:39.441
- As we go from one
reality to another one,

47:39.442 --> 47:42.307
the two lead characters
kind of swap places.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.553
- When the film switches
into that new gear

47:50.419 --> 47:54.905
and we wake up essentially
into Diane Selwyn's reality,

47:54.906 --> 47:56.873
the Naomi Watts character.

47:56.874 --> 47:57.874
- Hey, pretty girl.

47:59.842 --> 48:00.705
Time to wake up.

48:02.086 --> 48:04.777
- We realize that the first part

48:04.778 --> 48:08.677
was a sort of dream like
construction of a reality

48:08.678 --> 48:11.611
that she would
like to be living.

48:11.612 --> 48:12.993
This is all

48:14.339 --> 48:15.616
a tape recording.

48:16.583 --> 48:17.411
It is

48:19.103 --> 48:20.620
an illusion.

48:22.106 --> 48:25.902
- As opposed to the actual
reality she's living in,

48:25.903 --> 48:28.318
in which her girlfriend
is ignoring her

48:28.319 --> 48:31.908
and hooking up with
a more powerful man.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.703
And she's plotting to kill her.

48:34.912 --> 48:38.224
You got the money?

48:38.225 --> 48:39.985
This is the girl.

48:39.986 --> 48:44.644
- Diane and Camilla's real
life relationship is fraught

48:44.645 --> 48:46.992
and clearly at the
end of something.

48:46.993 --> 48:48.648
- You want me to make
this easy for you?

48:48.649 --> 48:49.891
No.

48:49.892 --> 48:53.377
No fucking way!
It's not gonna be!

48:53.378 --> 48:56.173
It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

48:56.174 --> 49:01.110
- But the fact that the
film spends most of its time

49:02.318 --> 49:04.664
in her dream life
of what she wished

49:04.665 --> 49:06.253
that relationship could be.

49:07.634 --> 49:11.361
It's less a negative depiction
of a queer relationship

49:11.362 --> 49:14.572
and more a depiction of
a human relationship.

49:28.793 --> 49:32.209
- "Heavenly Creatures"
is Peter Jackson's film,

49:32.210 --> 49:35.074
co-written with Fran Walsh
and based on the true story

49:35.075 --> 49:38.698
of two teenage girls
who become friends

49:38.699 --> 49:41.184
and lovers

49:41.185 --> 49:43.980
and murderers.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.291
- It's Mummy!

49:45.292 --> 49:48.294
- There is this terror
at the idea of like

49:48.295 --> 49:51.470
teenage girl friendship
tilting over into romance.

49:51.471 --> 49:53.990
- Homosexuality.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.993
- But she's always been
a normal happy child.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.649
- Oh, it can strike at any time

49:58.650 --> 50:01.963
and adolescents are
particularly vulnerable.

50:01.964 --> 50:04.517
- When I was 18, I moved
in with my best friend

50:04.518 --> 50:06.312
in New York and I
was in love with her.

50:06.313 --> 50:08.659
I was truly in love with her.

50:08.660 --> 50:13.665
And we went to see "Heavenly
Creatures."

50:25.884 --> 50:27.161
And it changed everything.

50:27.162 --> 50:28.541
I took the step and I was like,

50:28.542 --> 50:30.233
"I want to be with you.

50:30.234 --> 50:32.167
Let's just live the
way we wanna live."

50:33.961 --> 50:37.550
It was life affirming.

50:37.551 --> 50:40.139
- When I was younger, I
think I knew I was queer

50:40.140 --> 50:43.280
even though I didn't have
language for it necessarily.

50:43.281 --> 50:45.420
- I think I'm going crazy.

50:46.354 --> 50:48.699
- No, you're not, Gina.

50:48.700 --> 50:50.425
It's everyone else
who's bonkers.

50:51.738 --> 50:54.533
- I was very adept at
operating in the world

50:54.534 --> 50:57.260
and then running this
elaborate movie in my head

50:57.261 --> 50:58.641
where things were different.

50:59.746 --> 51:02.368
So I totally connected
with that idea

51:02.369 --> 51:05.130
of having this fantasy life
that you could escape to

51:05.131 --> 51:06.924
and wanting to make that real.

51:08.306 --> 51:09.135
- Oh God!

51:11.482 --> 51:15.864
We have a son, and heir.

51:15.865 --> 51:17.211
You're such an incredible woman.

51:17.212 --> 51:20.594
- I couldn't have done
it without you, Charles.

51:22.182 --> 51:24.873
- Any young woman who
ever even had an inkling

51:24.874 --> 51:26.772
that they might
like other girls,

51:26.773 --> 51:31.466
sees that relationship
and it just feels good.

51:31.467 --> 51:33.019
It speaks to being a young girl

51:33.020 --> 51:35.884
trying to figure out how the
fuck she wants to live her life

51:35.885 --> 51:37.577
and who she wants
to live it with.

51:38.681 --> 51:40.166
- We felt satisfied indeed.

51:41.581 --> 51:44.756
We have now learned the peace
of the thing called bliss.

51:46.310 --> 51:48.311
The joy of the thing called sin.

51:51.142 --> 51:53.178
- It's this thing we come up
against over and over again.

51:54.628 --> 51:57.320
Everyone is like this
attachment is very passionate,

51:57.321 --> 51:58.598
therefore it is bad.

51:59.737 --> 52:02.187
- Your daughter
appears to have formed

52:02.188 --> 52:05.328
a rather unwholesome
attachment to Juliet.

52:07.503 --> 52:11.575
- When straight people have
like intense, passionate,

52:11.576 --> 52:14.889
emotionally volcanic relationships,
that's aspirational.

52:14.890 --> 52:17.098
And when queer people
have like intense

52:17.099 --> 52:19.825
emotionally volcanic
relationship, it's dangerous.

52:19.826 --> 52:23.036
- It's the intensity of the
friendship that concerns me.

52:24.451 --> 52:28.317
I think we should avert
trouble before it starts.

52:29.836 --> 52:33.149
- I was rooting 100% for
those girls to be together.

52:33.150 --> 52:37.118
We're not going to be
separated. We're not.

52:37.948 --> 52:39.638
They can't make us!

52:39.639 --> 52:44.644
- You didn't watch society to
interfere with their lives.

52:45.507 --> 52:46.921
- You're not going anywhere.

52:46.922 --> 52:48.957
You're 15 years old, Yvonne!

52:48.958 --> 52:51.582
- Anger against mother
boiled up inside me.

52:53.066 --> 52:56.138
As it is she who was one of
the main obstacles in my path.

52:57.312 --> 53:00.176
- The film, it's
quite sympathetic

53:00.177 --> 53:03.765
to the killers.

53:03.766 --> 53:08.599
Is the message if you just let
queers be, they won't kill?

53:09.531 --> 53:11.635
I'm not so sure.

53:11.636 --> 53:14.431
I think it's more
indicative of the dangers

53:14.432 --> 53:17.365
of escaping into
this fantasy world.

53:17.366 --> 53:19.160
It is because we are mad!

53:19.161 --> 53:21.819
We are both stark raving mad!

53:24.925 --> 53:27.030
- The psychic damage
of forbidding someone

53:27.031 --> 53:30.827
from being who they are is
so profound that, you know,

53:30.828 --> 53:33.209
you end up with these
like very bad situations.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.072
- Look. Mother.

53:48.017 --> 53:50.709
- If we wanna be
us, we wanna be us.

53:50.710 --> 53:54.437
And if you don't want
that, it could get ugly.

53:57.510 --> 53:58.338
- Oh my God.

54:00.375 --> 54:02.825
- You're asking me to help
you fuck over the mob.

54:04.344 --> 54:06.035
I can fuck someone
I've just met.

54:07.451 --> 54:11.248
But steal? I need to know
someone like I know myself.

54:12.421 --> 54:14.422
- You think you
know me like that?

54:14.423 --> 54:18.738
- What a gift it is to be a
lesbian and watch "Bound."

54:19.980 --> 54:20.809
- Touch it.

54:22.949 --> 54:24.019
- What are you doing?

54:25.503 --> 54:26.780
- Isn't it obvious?

54:28.472 --> 54:30.645
I'm trying to seduce you.

54:30.646 --> 54:32.337
- Before they made "The Matrix,"

54:32.338 --> 54:34.580
The Wachowskis directed
this really hot movie

54:34.581 --> 54:36.168
about two lesbians.

54:36.169 --> 54:41.174
Queerness aside, it's just
this great noir pot boiler.

54:42.624 --> 54:45.004
Caesar's gonna get
the money, he's gonna bring it-

54:45.005 --> 54:47.075
- How much money?
- Shelly said it's over

54:47.076 --> 54:48.388
two million dollars.

54:49.838 --> 54:51.977
- "Bound" was one of the
best scripts I ever read.

54:51.978 --> 54:55.670
But they went to Warner Brothers
and Warner Brothers said,

54:55.671 --> 55:00.296
"We'll make it, you know,
if you make Corky a man."

55:00.297 --> 55:02.022
- Do I make you nervous, Corky?

55:04.301 --> 55:07.613
- Curious, baby.
- It's funny.

55:07.614 --> 55:10.202
I'm feeling a little
bit curious myself.

55:10.203 --> 55:11.652
- The Wachowskis said to me,

55:11.653 --> 55:14.344
"You would not believe how
many actresses refuse to come

55:14.345 --> 55:16.139
and read because they thought

55:16.140 --> 55:18.418
it would be detrimental
to their career.

55:19.902 --> 55:22.490
- Inside of you, there's a
little dyke just like me.

55:22.491 --> 55:24.147
- No, she's nothing like you.

55:24.148 --> 55:26.218
She's a whole lot
smarter than you are.

55:26.219 --> 55:28.324
- My character in "Bound",

55:28.325 --> 55:30.981
she's just a really
brilliant woman,

55:30.982 --> 55:34.985
stuck in a bad situation
and she happens to be gay.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.956
- I can't let you leave, Violet.

55:40.716 --> 55:41.923
Now if you're not with me

55:41.924 --> 55:43.580
then I have to assume
you're against me.

55:43.581 --> 55:48.586
- "Bound" has taken the
murderous villainist lesbian.

55:49.863 --> 55:53.350
Turn around.

55:54.523 --> 55:55.730
You?

55:55.731 --> 55:57.560
- But made them the
star of the show

55:57.561 --> 56:00.770
and made them who
you are rooting for.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.327
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

56:07.536 --> 56:09.330
- So when "Bound" was
initially released,

56:09.331 --> 56:12.298
we just thought it was
a movie about lesbians

56:12.299 --> 56:14.887
made by straight men.

56:14.888 --> 56:19.893
Wake up, you fucking dyke.

56:21.378 --> 56:26.313
- 'Cause I was so stuck on
the, you know, said gender

56:27.453 --> 56:29.074
that I just was like
that's it, that's it.

56:29.075 --> 56:30.075
All I need to know
is that men made it.

56:30.076 --> 56:31.802
It's corrupt, it's wrong.

56:33.528 --> 56:35.839
Then I finally watched
it and I was thinking

56:35.840 --> 56:38.739
it actually gets a lot
of les stuff really right

56:38.740 --> 56:40.638
and it feels really queer.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.469
- It was like, how
can The Wachowskis

56:44.470 --> 56:48.576
make such a beautiful,
sensitive movie about women

56:48.577 --> 56:50.716
and how can they
know so much about

56:50.717 --> 56:52.029
what's in a woman's heart?

56:52.926 --> 56:54.340
- But as it turns out,

56:54.341 --> 56:56.550
this was a movie about
lesbians made my trans women.

56:56.551 --> 56:58.863
Corky.

57:02.902 --> 57:04.559
I wanna tell you something.

57:05.663 --> 57:07.284
I know.

57:07.285 --> 57:09.701
- Maybe that has
something to do with why

57:09.702 --> 57:12.255
it feels different when
you're watching it.

57:12.256 --> 57:14.534
Kiss me.

57:17.261 --> 57:20.470
- The Wachowskis bring in
Susie Bright as a consultant

57:20.471 --> 57:23.024
so that when there is
a lesbian sex scene,

57:23.025 --> 57:25.648
an actual lesbian
sexpert is coming in

57:25.649 --> 57:27.063
to coach the actresses.

57:33.726 --> 57:37.418
- Things like that
specifically lesbianonic moment

57:37.419 --> 57:39.593
when Gina Gershon like
smells her fingers.

57:42.079 --> 57:44.495
- Hmm. Corky. Corky.

57:45.600 --> 57:47.842
- Or when she goes to the bar.

57:49.983 --> 57:53.572
it was kind of giving a
window into lesbian life

57:53.573 --> 57:55.954
and it was just a genre movie.

57:55.955 --> 57:57.369
Where's our money?

58:01.236 --> 58:05.032
It reset

58:05.033 --> 58:07.483
the calculus in my brain
over what was possible.

58:07.484 --> 58:10.797
- "Bound" really subverts that
like dangerous women trope

58:12.834 --> 58:17.320
because we finally get to
see these lesbians as heroes.

58:17.321 --> 58:19.115
- You don't want
to shoot me, Vi.

58:19.116 --> 58:22.739
I know you don't.

58:22.740 --> 58:26.191
- Caesar, you don't know shit.

58:30.507 --> 58:34.164
- You couldn't believe it
because it hadn't happened before.

58:34.165 --> 58:36.304
I was like wait, what?

58:36.305 --> 58:37.685
They're the heroes?

58:37.686 --> 58:40.067
- There's never a
sense that these women

58:40.068 --> 58:41.758
are being demonized.

58:41.759 --> 58:43.657
We want them to get away with it

58:43.658 --> 58:46.729
and we want them to get
away with each other.

58:46.730 --> 58:47.902
- You know what
the difference is

58:47.903 --> 58:49.595
between you and me, Violet?
- No.

58:51.320 --> 58:52.390
- Me neither.

58:53.771 --> 58:56.393
Both alive, both
together and with all the money.

58:56.394 --> 58:59.397
And that's a radical act
for a Hollywood movie.

59:05.093 --> 59:09.130
- There's always been the
terror of women with agency

59:09.131 --> 59:11.547
finding other women with agency

59:11.548 --> 59:14.378
and rebuilding a
culture or a society.

59:15.793 --> 59:18.036
And I think we see that
central tension in horror

59:18.037 --> 59:20.695
day after day, year after
year, decade after decade.

59:21.661 --> 59:23.075
- Part of me is embarrassed

59:23.076 --> 59:27.771
that I love to see these
horribly offensive, misogynist,

59:28.634 --> 59:31.187
yet delicious female villains

59:31.188 --> 59:34.017
but with the dearth of any kind
of powerful women characters

59:34.018 --> 59:36.330
on screen when I was growing up,

59:36.331 --> 59:39.092
those women were
weirdly aspirational.

59:40.473 --> 59:41.991
I wanna be like the
sexiest person in the room

59:41.992 --> 59:43.233
that everyone's afraid of.

59:47.998 --> 59:49.101
There's something there

59:49.102 --> 59:51.104
that's sort of
accidentally empowering.

59:52.243 --> 59:54.659
- There are people
who still do not have

59:54.660 --> 59:56.281
even one single safe person

59:56.282 --> 59:59.422
that they can talk about
their queerness with.

59:59.423 --> 1:00:03.115
So with watching a version
of ourselves on screen,

1:00:03.116 --> 1:00:08.121
it has profound effects in
helping people feel less lonely.

1:00:09.295 --> 1:00:10.813
- These films are
very, very important

1:00:10.814 --> 1:00:13.056
because they shape the way
people look at the world.

1:00:13.057 --> 1:00:15.369
Films make you realize
what your desires are

1:00:15.370 --> 1:00:18.510
or what your prejudices
are or what you want.

1:00:18.511 --> 1:00:20.857
Do you feel like an outsider?

1:00:20.858 --> 1:00:24.068
Do you feel like an outcast?
- We are the weirdos, mister.

1:00:25.414 --> 1:00:27.933
- Do you feel that
people should be accepted

1:00:27.934 --> 1:00:29.590
and loved for who they are?

1:00:29.591 --> 1:00:31.903
That to me is what
queerness represents,

1:00:31.904 --> 1:00:35.078
a fuck ton more than whether
or not you eat pussy.
