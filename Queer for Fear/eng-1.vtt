00:07.408 --> 00:11.812
(wind whistles)

00:11.812 --> 00:14.882
(thunder cracks)

00:19.987 --> 00:22.256
- It's a perfect night
for mystery and horror.

00:22.256 --> 00:26.060
The air itself is
filled with monsters.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.695
- I'm all ears.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.663
Open up your pits of hell.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.202
(ominous music)

00:37.538 --> 00:42.110
- As queer people, we are
considered outside of society

00:43.311 --> 00:47.381
and I think horror is
outside of society.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.850
(ominous music continues)

00:55.389 --> 00:58.058
- Horror stories upset
all the right people.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.595
People who can't
handle ambiguity,

01:01.595 --> 01:06.167
people who can't handle
violence or eroticism,

01:06.167 --> 01:10.271
people who think of the world
in these very clear-cut terms.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.108
(thunder cracks)

01:14.108 --> 01:15.576
- Most Americans are repelled

01:15.576 --> 01:17.945
by the mere notion
of homosexuality.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.981
The CBS News survey shows that
two out of three Americans

01:20.981 --> 01:24.518
look upon homosexuals with
disgust, discomfort, or fear.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.720
(distant scream)

01:26.720 --> 01:27.755
- What was that?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.789
- The main thing
about horror was

01:29.789 --> 01:32.226
that it was exciting
to get scared

01:32.226 --> 01:34.162
and that there was
an honesty to it,

01:34.162 --> 01:36.797
because I was responding
to how my body felt.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.598
So, kind of like porn.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.134
(birds screeching)

01:40.134 --> 01:41.634
- Your blood starts pumping.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.705
There is something very, very
primal about being afraid.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.642
- Horror designed to make
you incredibly uncomfortable.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.178
(Ridley screams)

01:50.178 --> 01:51.712
And I think that queer people

01:51.712 --> 01:53.080
are just generally better
at being uncomfortable.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.815
- Now kindly undo these straps.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.453
- Because queer has
been seen as bad,

01:59.453 --> 02:00.654
has been seen as the other,

02:00.654 --> 02:02.690
of course we're gonna
put anything bad

02:02.690 --> 02:04.592
and anything the
other as the monster.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.426
- I know who I am now, Sam.

02:06.426 --> 02:07.661
(Sam growls)

02:07.661 --> 02:09.062
- You wait till mom
finds out, buddy.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.698
- I always thought of
myself as a monster

02:10.698 --> 02:12.500
or a freak or a weirdo.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.836
- My, I'll bet you monsters
lead interesting lives.

02:15.836 --> 02:20.274
- I'm Frankenstein, I'm
Dracula, I'm Mrs. Danvers.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.909
(suspenseful music)

02:21.909 --> 02:23.110
- So many of us can relate

02:23.110 --> 02:24.578
to being the the
monster in the room.

02:24.578 --> 02:28.382
- I want to walk amongst
the commoners unnoticed.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.418
A prince amongst paupers.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.920
- The reason queer people have
latched onto these monsters

02:32.920 --> 02:36.656
is because we see
in them that society

02:36.656 --> 02:38.892
is always trying
to eradicate us.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.328
(banging on door)

02:40.328 --> 02:42.496
(werewolves screaming)

02:42.496 --> 02:44.632
And we're always
waiting to fight back.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.534
(suspenseful music)
(wood splinters)

02:46.534 --> 02:48.236
- That's how we're
represented in film.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.703
(werewolf howling)

02:49.703 --> 02:50.971
We're the bogeyman.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.139
We're the ones who
are out to get you.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.041
(glass squeaking)

02:54.041 --> 02:57.545
- A flood tide of filth
is engulfing our country

02:57.545 --> 02:59.347
and is threatening to pervert

02:59.347 --> 03:02.115
an entire generation of
our American children.

03:02.115 --> 03:02.950
(Glen screams)

03:02.950 --> 03:06.254
(screaming)

03:06.254 --> 03:08.155
- You sit the fuck down!

03:08.155 --> 03:09.690
(Leatherface whimpers)

03:09.690 --> 03:13.561
- They constantly portray
abnormal sexual behavior.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.297
They glorify unnatural sex acts.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.130
- Show me.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.468
- With so many queer creators,

03:20.468 --> 03:23.837
we see this affinity
with the shadowy margins

03:23.837 --> 03:26.006
of what's considered
respectable society.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.509
- Are you a member?

03:28.509 --> 03:30.944
- I'm looking for somebody.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.145
- Aren't we all?

03:32.145 --> 03:35.048
- The moment there's
some kind of queer lens

03:35.048 --> 03:37.050
being used to create,

03:37.050 --> 03:39.553
it immediately reflects
and reverberates

03:39.553 --> 03:41.522
throughout the piece.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.491
- The evolution of queer horror

03:43.491 --> 03:46.994
really parallels the
evolution of queer liberation.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.730
- They're waiting for you.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.664
(creature shrieks)

03:50.664 --> 03:52.800
- You begin with queer artists

03:52.800 --> 03:55.035
taking the spaces
we're allowed to have

03:55.035 --> 03:58.805
and slipping what we can
say into those spaces.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.108
* I'm afraid
there's no denyin' *

04:01.108 --> 04:03.043
* I'm just a dandy-lion

04:03.043 --> 04:06.347
- There's something affirming
about that vision in horror,

04:06.347 --> 04:07.781
because at least
we know we exist,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.317
at least we know
we are out there,

04:09.317 --> 04:10.618
even if we're only there

04:10.618 --> 04:13.853
to put the fear of God
into straight people.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.791
(woman speaks in
foreign language)

04:17.791 --> 04:20.394
- Through this material,
today's youth can be enticed

04:20.394 --> 04:23.831
to enter the world of
homosexuals, lesbians,

04:23.831 --> 04:26.300
and other sex deviants.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.602
We know that once a
person is perverted,

04:28.602 --> 04:31.572
it is practically
impossible for that person

04:31.572 --> 04:35.075
to adjust to normal
attitudes in regard to sex.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.745
(upbeat vocalization)

04:40.414 --> 04:43.183
(Jesse screams)

04:44.084 --> 04:47.020
(upbeat pop music)

05:13.981 --> 05:16.484
- We queers have been a
part of the genre of horror

05:16.484 --> 05:17.718
since the beginning, right?

05:17.718 --> 05:18.719
Since the beginning.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.722
(suspenseful music)

05:43.176 --> 05:44.578
- The horror genre as we know it

05:44.578 --> 05:47.180
really dates back to
folkloric traditions

05:47.180 --> 05:49.550
and then the gothic
tradition in literature

05:49.550 --> 05:51.552
in the 17th and 18th century.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.888
When you wanted to
write about queers,

05:54.888 --> 05:57.591
you had to find a sort
of coded way to do it.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.463
- We queers have always
had our own language.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.966
- If you know, you know,

06:05.966 --> 06:07.968
but otherwise it just kind
of goes over your head.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.572
And if somebody sees
it, it's on them.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.774
It's not quite on you.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.743
(heavy breathing)

06:15.743 --> 06:18.779
- The gothic is literally
about sublimated,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.448
hidden things coming to light.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.419
The dead, or the
past, or desires,

06:25.419 --> 06:27.254
or things that have
been pushed down.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.723
The whole point is you
can't suppress the dead,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.024
you can't suppress the past.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.794
It's always gonna
come up and erupt

06:35.162 --> 06:37.965
in some really interesting
and terrifying way.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.634
(curious music)

06:42.202 --> 06:45.238
- One of the defining
characteristics of
those gothic novels

06:45.238 --> 06:49.209
is that they are all
about transgression.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.513
Resurrecting the
dead, drinking blood,

06:52.513 --> 06:55.315
making Faustian
deals with the devil.

06:55.315 --> 07:00.287
And tied to that is, of
course, sexual transgression.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.556
(curious music)

07:02.556 --> 07:05.058
- We've now reached
a sort of stage

07:05.058 --> 07:07.861
with a very, very long
history of the gothic

07:07.861 --> 07:09.897
in literature and in film,

07:09.897 --> 07:12.633
where we can actually start to
look back at things and say,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.635
"You know, that's not quite

07:14.635 --> 07:16.403
what it appeared
to be at the time."

07:16.403 --> 07:19.473
(dark whimsical music)

07:19.473 --> 07:21.742
- The general names
from the 19th century

07:21.742 --> 07:23.944
that we associate with horror

07:23.944 --> 07:27.581
are really Bram Stoker,
Robert Louis Stevenson,

07:27.581 --> 07:29.983
but before that is Mary Shelley.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.219
- [Man] She is an angel.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.721
- You think so?

07:33.721 --> 07:37.424
- It is no surprise that a
woman created the horror genre.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.692
(thunder cracks)

07:38.692 --> 07:39.727
We're suppressed in
more ways than one,

07:39.727 --> 07:42.062
especially a queer woman.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.196
(Mary laughs)

07:43.196 --> 07:46.399
She had all the
ammunition in the world

07:46.399 --> 07:49.837
to create monsters, and she did.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.541
(heart beating)

07:57.077 --> 07:59.146
- Mary, what an icon.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.248
I'm just gonna invent science
fiction in an afternoon.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.415
Do you guys want anything?

08:02.415 --> 08:03.851
Like, "Yeah, thanks.
Thanks, Mary."

08:05.418 --> 08:10.423
- Mary Shelly is not only the
mother of the horror genre

08:11.291 --> 08:12.526
and the science fiction genre.

08:12.526 --> 08:16.363
She is a leading
feminist idealist

08:16.363 --> 08:20.367
and also the goth-est
of the goth girls.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.969
- Mary Shelley is so goth.

08:21.969 --> 08:25.238
She lost her virginity on
her mother's gravestone.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.274
- Here I come!

08:28.976 --> 08:31.144
- We all know this
image of Mary Shelley,

08:31.144 --> 08:32.212
hanging out in the graveyards,

08:32.212 --> 08:34.548
and there's a much more romantic

08:34.548 --> 08:36.082
and heartfelt way to look at it.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.719
Her mother, Mary Goodwin,
was a prolific writer

08:38.719 --> 08:40.621
before feminism was even a word,

08:40.621 --> 08:43.056
was very much so of
the feminist spirit.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.893
She died within weeks
of Mary being born.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.961
The only way for Mary Shelly

08:47.961 --> 08:50.530
to have a connection
with her mother

08:50.530 --> 08:53.466
was to be in the space
that her mother left her

08:53.466 --> 08:54.968
and to read her literature

08:54.968 --> 08:57.771
and sort of piece
together a relationship

08:57.771 --> 08:59.640
with this woman she
never got to meet.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.710
- Mary Shelly was
pretty radical.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.145
She was very sexually liberal,

09:05.145 --> 09:08.348
experimenting, very open-minded.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.917
And what was also great

09:09.917 --> 09:11.619
was just her
equality with the men

09:11.619 --> 09:13.486
that she was spending time with.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.657
- Mary Shelley was married
to Percy Bysshe Shelley.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.259
They were also part
of a who knows exactly

09:19.259 --> 09:21.261
relationship with Lord Byron.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.664
The trio was allegedly
booted out of England

09:23.664 --> 09:26.734
because of their
notorious behavior.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.936
- She was one of the
original hags, right?

09:28.936 --> 09:31.071
I mean, she could
hang out, you know?

09:31.071 --> 09:35.075
She was there for her gays,
and they were there for her.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.845
Hanging out with these
sexually fluid men

09:37.845 --> 09:40.113
and also having her own secrets

09:40.113 --> 09:42.449
really speaks to
her being a pioneer

09:42.449 --> 09:46.787
in the art of monsters and
of horror and storytelling

09:46.787 --> 09:49.522
at that time when those
stories were so new.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.126
- She's so goth.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.196
- They ended up in
Europe at Villa Diodati

09:56.196 --> 09:58.265
where they all decided
to write ghost stories

09:58.265 --> 10:00.734
fueled by drugs and
sex and alcohol.

10:00.734 --> 10:04.204
- She's really turning
it for the goths, honey.

10:04.204 --> 10:08.408
- She's 18, she's hanging out
with her husband and his bros.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.342
I shouldn't call them bros.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.543
They were all having sex.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.746
- It is an age of
dreams and nightmares.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.182
- Yes, and we are merely
the children of the age.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.351
- And she has a nightmare
about this shambling behemoth.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.088
(thunder cracks)

10:22.122 --> 10:23.590
(Mary screams)

10:23.590 --> 10:26.459
She writes it down, and she
kind of invents science fiction

10:26.459 --> 10:27.494
and horror in the same moment.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.162
(thunder cracks)
(rat squeaks)

10:29.162 --> 10:30.263
(eerie music)

10:30.263 --> 10:31.765
- As the story goes,

10:31.765 --> 10:34.868
Mary Shelley came up with
the concept of Frankenstein

10:34.868 --> 10:36.103
when she was debating,

10:36.103 --> 10:38.471
what's the scariest
story you can think of?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.008
Kind of fitting
that a female author

10:41.008 --> 10:43.911
would think the scariest
thing I can think of

10:43.911 --> 10:46.714
is a man trying to create life.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.150
- It's such a commentary
on a man's world,

10:50.150 --> 10:52.720
and it's such a commentary
on the audacity of men

10:52.720 --> 10:54.454
to think that they
could even create

10:54.454 --> 10:57.324
a functioning creature
without a woman.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.427
(eerie music)

11:00.427 --> 11:02.195
Like, the balls it
must have took for her

11:02.195 --> 11:04.031
to put those words on that page.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.899
- She's writing in an era
where there aren't a lot

11:05.899 --> 11:07.901
of female authors to begin with.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.770
It's certainly not
a respectable thing

11:09.770 --> 11:10.971
for her to be doing.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.906
Just by virtue of her
writing this book,

11:12.906 --> 11:15.308
this is like this
radical statement that,

11:15.308 --> 11:20.313
I, a bisexual woman, am capable
of these manly pursuits.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.350
- The Frankenstein monster
is literally made up

11:23.350 --> 11:26.920
of bits and pieces of other
people and other psyches,

11:26.920 --> 11:29.857
is this extraordinary outsider.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.393
- This idea that you can
recombine the elements

11:33.393 --> 11:38.131
of a human to create something
is inherently terrifying.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.601
But I think that that's sort
of what it means to be queer

11:41.601 --> 11:43.503
is you're sort of taking
all these elements

11:43.503 --> 11:47.074
of masculinity or femininity
and you're redesigning them

11:47.074 --> 11:48.742
into the person that you are.

11:49.642 --> 11:50.778
(dark playful music)

11:50.778 --> 11:52.579
- The monster chooses to attack

11:52.579 --> 11:54.581
and kill Victor
Frankenstein's wife

11:54.581 --> 11:57.584
on their wedding night so
that they never consummate.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.986
And from that point on,

11:58.986 --> 12:03.891
Victor Frankenstein is
obsessed with his male creation

12:05.292 --> 12:06.726
and is chasing the male
creation all over the world.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.429
And if that's not a queer
narrative, I don't know what is.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.799
- The literature
shows Frankenstein

12:11.799 --> 12:16.804
as so much more articulate
and smart and charismatic

12:18.138 --> 12:22.009
instead of this mumbling,
horrible creature.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.576
(The Monster whimpers)

12:23.576 --> 12:26.746
- The monster and Frankenstein
are kind of constantly

12:26.746 --> 12:29.149
ever changing, two
beings within the same

12:29.149 --> 12:30.617
that are overlapping.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.186
Frankenstein catches up with
the doctor and explains,

12:33.186 --> 12:34.955
oh yeah, I learned language.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.489
You know what I mean?

12:36.489 --> 12:39.092
Like, here I am, I'm
you, which is a monster,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.829
but I'm gonna reflect
back to you what you are.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.135
- There is something very,
very dream girls about it,

12:48.135 --> 12:50.904
of showing up at somebody's
doorstep and being like.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.274
- * And I am telling you

12:55.742 --> 12:57.210
- I am telling you
I am not going.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.746
- * I'm not going

12:59.746 --> 13:01.748
- You are going to love me and
if you're not gonna love me,

13:01.748 --> 13:03.583
you are going to admit
that you don't love me

13:03.583 --> 13:05.085
and you are gonna tell me why,

13:05.085 --> 13:08.088
and you will not be
able to hide from that.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.757
(ominous music)

13:12.159 --> 13:14.661
- My favorite part
of Frankenstein

13:14.661 --> 13:16.864
is that Mary Shelly was queer,

13:16.864 --> 13:20.333
because as many historians
love to argue against,

13:20.333 --> 13:25.338
we have written texts from Mary
Shelly to her friend saying

13:26.739 --> 13:28.942
that she likes to get
tousey-mousey with women.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.011
(somber string music)

13:31.011 --> 13:35.248
- "April 8th, 1825.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.950
When I return to Italy,

13:36.950 --> 13:40.053
I shall not come
without my Jane,

13:40.053 --> 13:44.624
who is now necessary to
my existence almost."

13:44.624 --> 13:48.095
Girl, she's not going without
Jane, so don't even ask.

13:48.095 --> 13:52.165
"I never saw a woman I
thought so fascinating.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.733
Had I been a man,

13:53.733 --> 13:56.937
I should certainly have
fallen in love with her

13:56.937 --> 13:59.006
and had she taken the trouble,

13:59.006 --> 14:02.475
she might have wound
me round her finger."

14:02.475 --> 14:04.878
Oh girl, I bet.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.115
"I was so ready to
give myself away,

14:08.115 --> 14:10.250
and being afraid of men,

14:10.250 --> 14:14.888
I was apt to get
tousey-mousey for women."

14:14.888 --> 14:15.956
Tousey-mousey?

14:17.490 --> 14:21.794
(pages flip)
(somber string music)

14:21.794 --> 14:23.530
She was like, you know what?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.498
Yeah, I was a
lesbian for a while.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.067
I was like dating a girl.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.536
No, you know, that
didn't work out.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.370
I don't know.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.905
I don't really like men.

14:31.905 --> 14:35.542
She's so progressive.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.676
I like her.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.045
- Can you believe that bland

14:38.045 --> 14:40.647
and lovely brow conceived
of Frankenstein?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.083
- Such an audience
needs something stronger

14:43.083 --> 14:45.185
than a pretty little love story.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.520
So why shouldn't I
write of monsters?

14:47.520 --> 14:51.658
- She saw it as a gruesome
story of what it was like

14:51.658 --> 14:55.062
to create a version of
yourself from nothing.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.830
That's her through line, I
think, through Frankenstein,

14:57.830 --> 15:00.133
is she had to create
herself from nothing.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.869
It was like all the
pieces just came together

15:02.869 --> 15:04.972
and she was able to really,
I mean quite literally,

15:04.972 --> 15:06.473
all the pieces came together

15:06.473 --> 15:09.209
and she was able to
make this masterpiece.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.878
(ominous music)

15:15.748 --> 15:18.651
- You wake foul dreams
of sensual life.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.092
- What a strange poem.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.327
Who wrote it?

15:27.327 --> 15:29.396
- Brilliant young
Irishman out of Oxford.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.597
His name is Oscar Wilde.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.068
(heart beating)

15:38.972 --> 15:42.309
- Oscar Fingal
O'Flahertie Wills Wilde.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.277
He's an extremely modern figure.

15:44.277 --> 15:48.281
He became really a sort
of self-made celebrity,

15:48.281 --> 15:53.286
but as a writer, he became
a phenomenon of the age.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.623
(curious synth music)

15:57.957 --> 16:00.727
- Oscar Wilde was so
brilliant and so successful

16:00.727 --> 16:04.297
and so capable with language
and with the art form,

16:04.297 --> 16:05.932
but he was keeping a secret.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.567
- I like persons
better than principles

16:07.567 --> 16:09.036
and persons with no principles

16:09.036 --> 16:10.503
better than anything
else in the world.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.838
Now I remember.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.273
- Remember what, Henry?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.042
- When I heard the
name of Dorian Gray.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.943
- What's beautiful
about Dorian Gray

16:16.943 --> 16:20.913
is he created the myth of
what happens with repression.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.050
Ultimately, repression
will eat you up inside

16:23.050 --> 16:24.617
and you will turn
into a monster.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.619
- Each of us has
heaven and hell in him.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.721
- But if this is true,

16:28.721 --> 16:30.190
if this is what you've
done with your life,

16:30.190 --> 16:32.659
it is far worse than anything
that's been said or done.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.027
- The Picture of Dorian Gray

16:34.027 --> 16:36.096
is one of those horror classics.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.931
There's this guy who never
seems to get any older

16:38.931 --> 16:41.101
and it turns out he
has a magic painting

16:41.101 --> 16:43.036
that ages while he doesn't,

16:43.036 --> 16:45.905
and it's becoming
darker and more decrepit

16:45.905 --> 16:49.309
and there is something
horrible at the center of it.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.543
- What is your secret, Dorian?

16:50.543 --> 16:51.644
You don't look a day
older than you did

16:51.644 --> 16:53.213
when that portrait was painted.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.714
- Perhaps I'll tell you someday.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.149
- Wilde's The Picture
of Dorian Gray,

16:56.149 --> 16:59.552
which is a much more
queer take on this idea

16:59.552 --> 17:02.722
of the multiple selves
that are contained

17:02.722 --> 17:07.727
within someone and our capacity
for debauchery or evil.

17:08.928 --> 17:12.765
- Dorian is sort of
an amoral character

17:13.633 --> 17:14.767
and a very queer character.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.805
Beautiful, vain,
consumed with pleasure.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.973
If you're talking about
the horror continuum,

17:20.973 --> 17:24.377
I think you can draw a
line from Dorian Gray

17:24.377 --> 17:27.579
through a character like
The Talented Mr. Ripley

17:27.579 --> 17:29.082
by Patricia High Smith,

17:29.082 --> 17:33.353
all the way to Patrick
Bateman in American Psycho.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.289
- The Picture of Dorian
Gray is very much about

17:36.289 --> 17:38.558
the dangers of
being in the closet,

17:38.558 --> 17:41.128
of having a thing that you
feel like you can't speak about

17:41.128 --> 17:42.662
to anyone else.

17:42.662 --> 17:47.167
- He is a wounded, deeply
tortured queer character,

17:48.801 --> 17:51.471
trapped in a narrative that
he's desperately trying

17:51.471 --> 17:52.939
to break out of.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.375
- He's taking his and
our collective experience

17:55.375 --> 17:57.544
of being suppressed and
repressed and punished

17:57.544 --> 18:00.113
for who we are and
he's birthing it

18:00.113 --> 18:01.648
into this beautiful metaphor.

18:03.049 --> 18:06.186
That, to me, is wildly powerful
that he was able to do that

18:06.186 --> 18:08.054
before it all came
crashing down.

18:08.054 --> 18:12.859
What's amazing is that he's
also foreseeing where his life

18:12.859 --> 18:16.863
is going to go once he actually
gets caught and charged

18:16.863 --> 18:20.433
and then placed into jail
for his homosexuality.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.905
- 1895 is two years before
Dracula is published.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.641
The sort of high water
mark of so much of,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.010
of what we associate is that,

18:31.010 --> 18:33.246
that kind of gothic literature.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.483
And that was the year that
Wilde fell from grace.

18:36.483 --> 18:39.486
Buggery had been a
crime for centuries,

18:39.486 --> 18:42.121
but it was rarely
prosecuted until

18:42.121 --> 18:47.126
a man called Henry Labouchère
suddenly changed the rules

18:47.860 --> 18:49.128
and Wilde was the first

18:49.128 --> 18:52.232
and most famous casualty
of the whole thing.

18:54.234 --> 18:58.871
But he was fascinatingly
given the chance to go.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.707
I think it's either
a combination

19:00.707 --> 19:02.742
of a very sympathetic magistrate

19:02.742 --> 19:05.278
or actually the
establishment not wanting

19:05.278 --> 19:08.515
to lift the rug on
an awful lot of stuff

19:08.515 --> 19:10.149
they didn't want to come out,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.618
but he decided not to go.

19:11.618 --> 19:15.255
So he was arrested.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.856
- It would've been
very easy for Wilde

19:16.856 --> 19:19.192
to have fled the country,
to have become an expat,

19:19.192 --> 19:22.829
to have run off to France to
avoid the prison sentence.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.531
But you know, he
stood and fought.

19:24.531 --> 19:28.134
That's a really great act
of heroism that I don't know

19:28.134 --> 19:30.337
that Oscar Wilde always
gets the credit for.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.943
- And then he was sentenced
to two years of hard labor

19:36.943 --> 19:41.948
and for a man like him,
it was a death sentence.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.486
The judge hideously
said he thought

19:46.486 --> 19:48.555
it was completely insufficient

19:48.555 --> 19:50.790
for the gravity of his crime

19:50.790 --> 19:53.726
of daring to love
someone of his own sex.

19:56.463 --> 20:01.334
He is conflated in the popular
imagination with monstrosity.

20:03.836 --> 20:04.937
- Heaven, forgive me.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.906
- Once his identity was exposed

20:06.906 --> 20:09.509
and it was out there and
he was living with it,

20:09.509 --> 20:12.111
it seems like it kind of opened
up corridors for him to use

20:12.111 --> 20:14.547
all of that brilliance that
he had been sublimating

20:14.547 --> 20:16.816
into a heteronormative structure

20:16.816 --> 20:19.986
and then he kind of
found his own, to me,

20:19.986 --> 20:21.921
authenticity and queerness.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.059
- Wilde was a brilliant writer

20:27.059 --> 20:30.263
who actually put his
genius into his life.

20:30.263 --> 20:34.534
His life is why we
really remember him.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.470
- There's no such thing as
a good influence, Mr. Gray.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.372
All influence is immoral.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.840
- [Dorian] Why?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.775
- Because the aim of
life is self development.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.944
To realize one's
nature perfectly.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.179
That's what we're here for.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.917
- I think he was a man
who actually worried

20:50.917 --> 20:52.585
that he was trivial,

20:52.585 --> 20:55.688
that in the end he would be
remembered for some funny plays

20:55.688 --> 21:00.360
and some funny quips,
and incredibly,

21:00.360 --> 21:02.429
by not running away,
he became immortal.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.540
(wood creaking)

21:24.016 --> 21:26.686
(heart beating)

21:30.557 --> 21:32.392
- There've been a lot of
rumors about Bram Stoker

21:32.392 --> 21:35.862
over the decades about what
his actual sexuality was.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.830
(eerie music)

21:37.830 --> 21:40.066
- First of all, Bram
Stoker was kind of cute.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.704
Like he kind of could
get just a tad bit.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.105
That's one thing I wanna say.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.242
- Even if Bram Stoker
was queer in some way,

21:50.242 --> 21:54.647
my understanding is
that he was not out.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.685
And I think that that can
be a very conflicted place

21:58.685 --> 22:00.319
from which to create.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.390
- A few years ago,

22:03.390 --> 22:05.291
David Skal, a horror
film historian,

22:05.291 --> 22:08.395
found a letter that Stoker
had written to Walt Whitman,

22:08.395 --> 22:10.196
who was probably the
most famous homosexual

22:10.196 --> 22:11.664
of the 19th century.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.100
- His letters to Walt Whitman
are clearly love letters.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.570
They sort of quake
with the quiet longing

22:17.570 --> 22:19.372
that I remember having

22:19.372 --> 22:22.208
for my secret male
crushes growing up

22:22.208 --> 22:24.811
and he says everything
but, you know,

22:24.811 --> 22:27.113
what he wants to
say and even then,

22:27.113 --> 22:29.281
inferring that there
are some things

22:29.281 --> 22:30.550
that he would rather
say in person.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.786
I don't know, it feels
pretty darn gay to me.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.989
(somber string music)

22:36.989 --> 22:38.591
- [Stoker] "My dear Mr. Whitman,

22:39.726 --> 22:42.328
Do not think me cheeky
for writing this.

22:42.328 --> 22:44.697
I only hope we may sometime meet

22:44.697 --> 22:48.868
and I shall be able to perhaps
to say what I cannot write.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.539
I have to thank you
for many happy hours,

22:52.539 --> 22:56.909
for I've read your poems with
my door locked late at night.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.046
You who wrote the words
know them better than I do

23:00.046 --> 23:04.183
and to you, who sing of
your land of progress,

23:04.183 --> 23:07.787
the words have a meaning
that I can only imagine.

23:07.787 --> 23:11.524
But be assured of
this Walt Whitman,

23:11.524 --> 23:15.394
that a man of less than
half your own age here

23:15.394 --> 23:19.198
felt his heart leap toward
you across the Atlantic

23:19.198 --> 23:24.203
and his soul swelling at the
words or rather the thoughts.

23:25.772 --> 23:30.777
How sweet a thing it is
for a strong, healthy man

23:31.944 --> 23:35.548
with a woman's eye and
a child's wishes to feel

23:35.548 --> 23:39.852
that he can speak to a man
who can be, if he wishes,

23:39.852 --> 23:44.857
father and brother
and wife to his soul.

23:48.495 --> 23:52.865
You have shaken off the shackles
and your wings are free.

23:52.865 --> 23:56.469
I have the shackles
on my shoulders still,

23:56.469 --> 23:58.270
but I have no wings."

24:01.541 --> 24:05.845
- Bram Stoker feels emboldened
at some point to perhaps,

24:05.845 --> 24:08.014
you know, start making
his way out of the closet.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.850
Talking about his
correspondence with Walt Whitman

24:10.850 --> 24:14.687
and then in light
of cultural events,

24:14.687 --> 24:16.455
suddenly does a full 180.

24:18.925 --> 24:22.662
- We know that he was part
of Oscar Wilde's circle.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.297
He was another Irish expatriate.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.934
- Stoker knew Oscar Wilde well.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.602
They were friends
and contemporaries.

24:29.602 --> 24:33.806
Wilde's arrest and and
prosecution detonated a bomb

24:33.806 --> 24:36.442
in British society.

24:36.442 --> 24:41.013
- After the Wilde trial, there
was a lot more burrowing,

24:41.013 --> 24:44.116
a lot more marriages,
a lot more hiding

24:44.116 --> 24:47.554
from what was obviously gonna
be a very unaccepting public.

24:47.554 --> 24:51.691
- Stoker married Oscar
Wilde's ex, Florence,

24:51.691 --> 24:54.493
which is a curious
turn of events.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.596
Stoker's passion was the theater

24:56.596 --> 24:59.732
and his great hero was the
English actor Henry Irving.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.669
It was an extraordinary
relationship.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.737
Irving treated him appallingly.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.973
It's very hard not to interpret

25:06.973 --> 25:10.543
from our perspective
as being sub/dom.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.144
- Wake up, master.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.379
(coffin creaks)

25:13.379 --> 25:16.583
- The character of
Renfield in the book,

25:16.583 --> 25:19.919
I think there's a kind
of transference there.

25:19.919 --> 25:24.356
- I will be one of those who
benefits from your generosity.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.494
- That Stoker is putting
himself in the position

25:28.494 --> 25:32.665
of this imprisoned madman
enthralled to his master.

25:32.665 --> 25:33.833
(Renfield screams)

25:33.833 --> 25:35.334
- Good evening.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.804
- Stoker's working out a lot
of his own issues in Dracula.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.872
There's this idea of sexuality

25:39.872 --> 25:44.143
as being this enticing force
and difficult to resist,

25:44.143 --> 25:47.680
but one must, because ultimately
you know it's monstrous

25:47.680 --> 25:49.548
and it's going to destroy you.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.823
- Welcome to my home.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.794
- Dracula is largely
more an expression

26:01.794 --> 26:05.431
of a fear of queerness.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.602
(glass shatters)

26:09.602 --> 26:14.607
In that Dracula's modus
operandi appears to be

26:15.474 --> 26:18.277
to enslave women and torture men

26:18.277 --> 26:23.015
with a kind of psychological
psychosexual obsession.

26:23.015 --> 26:27.620
- When the three vampire brides
try and feast off Harker,

26:27.620 --> 26:31.123
Dracula appears and he's
absolutely furious and he says,

26:31.123 --> 26:32.524
"This man belongs to me."

26:32.524 --> 26:35.662
In Stoker's notes that
is written constantly.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.496
Every time he comes back
to his notes over a period

26:37.496 --> 26:39.832
of seven years, he
writes it again.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.533
It's very important to him.

26:41.533 --> 26:44.303
Seems to mean
something quite primal.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.205
- After the
publication of Dracula,

26:46.205 --> 26:48.741
Bram Stoker becomes
very vocally homophobic,

26:48.741 --> 26:50.576
writing letters to
parliament saying

26:50.576 --> 26:52.945
that gay writers should
all be put in prison.

26:58.084 --> 27:01.654
One could argue that the
existence of Dracula itself

27:01.654 --> 27:05.591
is as much of a dodge as those
letters to parliament were.

27:05.591 --> 27:08.494
That Stoker is
basically saying, yes,

27:08.494 --> 27:11.097
I know that sexuality
seems like something

27:11.097 --> 27:12.965
that you really
want to give into,

27:12.965 --> 27:16.468
but you mustn't or you will
be doomed for all eternity.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.771
- And then obviously what
Stoker is famous for,

27:18.771 --> 27:22.074
he drew together over a
period of several years

27:22.074 --> 27:26.312
these myths and legends about
vampires into a book which

27:26.312 --> 27:28.715
is originally called The Undead,

27:28.715 --> 27:31.684
featuring a character
called Count Vampire.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.219
It's very on the nose.

27:33.219 --> 27:36.723
And then, brilliantly,
he came across the legend

27:36.723 --> 27:41.728
of a real life
Transylvanian warlord.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.897
Son of the Dragon, Dracula.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.000
I've seen it ,the actual
page of the manuscript,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.403
and he's crossed out The
Undead and writes Dracula.

27:51.403 --> 27:52.238
That's it.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.807
It's a game changer,

27:54.807 --> 27:57.176
the way that Shelley's
Frankenstein is a game changer.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.510
Something happens there

27:58.510 --> 28:01.480
which pulls all these
legends together

28:01.480 --> 28:06.285
and starts to make the
vampire into a popular figure

28:06.285 --> 28:08.354
that we all understand.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.690
(rat squeaks)
(thunder cracks)

28:11.690 --> 28:15.261
- Dracula becomes the sort
of heir text for vampires

28:15.261 --> 28:17.096
and it's probably one of
the most filmed stories

28:17.096 --> 28:18.297
of all time.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.833
- As we see literary
storytelling giving way

28:20.833 --> 28:22.802
to cinematic storytelling,

28:22.802 --> 28:24.103
there are a lot of queer
artists who are there

28:24.103 --> 28:26.372
to make sure that
that subtext survives

28:26.372 --> 28:29.308
and in fact flourishes as
presented on the big screen.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.944
- So, F.W. Murnau.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.914
- After fighting in World War I,

28:34.914 --> 28:38.017
Murnau is existing
in Weimar, Germany

28:38.017 --> 28:41.087
and if we know
anything from Cabaret,

28:41.087 --> 28:42.321
it's that Germany
was a great place

28:42.321 --> 28:43.823
to be gay until it wasn't.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.192
(spooky synth music)

28:46.192 --> 28:48.260
He got out when the
getting was good

28:48.260 --> 28:51.030
and came to the United States
but not before, you know,

28:51.030 --> 28:55.167
making obviously some
singularly iconic queer horror,

28:55.167 --> 28:58.805
including Der Januskopf,
Faust, and Nosferatu.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.539
- It's extraordinary to think

29:00.539 --> 29:03.843
that he had his hand in
Dracula with Nosferatu

29:03.843 --> 29:05.744
and he had his hand
in Jekyll and Hyde.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.280
- Murnau made an
unauthorized version

29:08.280 --> 29:10.349
of Dr. Jekyll and Hyde
in the early twenties

29:10.349 --> 29:11.851
called Der Januskopf.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.787
These themes of doubled selfs,

29:14.787 --> 29:16.288
a self that is presented

29:16.288 --> 29:19.091
to the world and a self
that is secret and hidden,

29:19.091 --> 29:21.861
that is the more
libidinal, eroticized self,

29:21.861 --> 29:22.761
appealed to him.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.799
- In a film that is
tragically lost to us,

29:26.799 --> 29:28.434
the metaphors are all just
kind of sitting there.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.769
This thing inside me
that I can't control

29:30.769 --> 29:32.038
and it wants to come out

29:32.038 --> 29:33.806
and I mustn't let it
because if it does,

29:33.806 --> 29:35.875
then horrible
things will happen.

29:35.875 --> 29:39.278
(spooky synth music)

29:39.278 --> 29:40.980
- We can't help but express

29:40.980 --> 29:43.182
this sort of duality
that we all feel.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.284
And if you're aware
of being queer,

29:45.284 --> 29:48.821
that parallel is sort of
unmistakable and delicious.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.924
(spooky synth music)

29:53.659 --> 29:55.895
- The devil is almost
always portrayed as a man

29:55.895 --> 29:57.596
because, you know, the Bible.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.500
And so in a story like Faust,

30:01.500 --> 30:04.703
you are left with one
man trying to show a man

30:04.703 --> 30:06.973
all the possibilities
that life might entail

30:06.973 --> 30:10.742
if only he'll sign up
for his dark forces.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.545
You have the devil being
the person who's trying

30:13.545 --> 30:17.183
to seduce the central figure
away from the beautiful

30:17.183 --> 30:18.918
and wholesome love of a woman.

30:20.352 --> 30:23.389
- There's always a neglected
woman over there, isn't there?

30:23.389 --> 30:26.358
Faust is having to choose
between her and the devil.

30:29.795 --> 30:32.198
And I think we might hope
that he gets taken for good.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.533
I don't know, at least a
little part of me does.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.335
To come up with some
of that imagery,

30:36.335 --> 30:40.940
I think it requires a
willingness to play in the dark.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.811
There are things that
go on in the dark,

30:45.811 --> 30:47.846
there are freedoms to
explore in the dark

30:49.048 --> 30:51.717
and Faust is very
much like Nosferatu

30:51.717 --> 30:54.120
in that the world of
the so called devil,

30:54.120 --> 30:57.656
enemy, evil figure,
is so intoxicating.

30:59.125 --> 31:02.261
It makes it so clear why you
want to dance with the devil.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.797
(ominous music)

31:06.966 --> 31:10.202
- Nosferatu is the one
that changed everything.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.371
- Where do horror
movies really start?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.006
They start with Nosferatu.

31:14.006 --> 31:17.509
They start with
this coded, phallic,

31:17.509 --> 31:20.179
vampire cinematic image.

31:20.179 --> 31:23.415
That's where our understanding
of what a monster is begins

31:23.415 --> 31:26.953
and it's no wonder that the
monster is so captivating

31:26.953 --> 31:30.589
and so seductive even
as they're horrifying.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.659
So much of that must have
come from F.W. Murnau's

31:33.659 --> 31:37.163
being a queer artist, from Bram
Stoker being a queer artist.

31:37.163 --> 31:42.001
That stuff is kind of in the
DNA of what a movie monster is.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.003
(spooky music)

31:44.003 --> 31:46.038
- I love a lot of
the Dracula films,

31:46.038 --> 31:50.442
but the one that hits closest
to home for me is Nosferatu.

31:52.544 --> 31:56.182
All of the other depictions
of Dracula tend to be

31:56.182 --> 32:01.087
a dashing romantic hero
and I've never seen Dracula

32:01.820 --> 32:03.322
as a romantic hero.

32:03.322 --> 32:07.059
I've always seen him as
hobbled and made sort of,

32:07.059 --> 32:12.064
despite his power, pitifully
small by his monstrousness.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.235
- Unlike in the book
where Dracula begins

32:16.235 --> 32:19.805
as a hideous old man and
then gradually gets younger,

32:19.805 --> 32:24.810
he stays hideous and Max
Schreck's look is iconic.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.913
- On my bucket list was
always to play a vampire,

32:27.913 --> 32:30.149
but the one I really
related to was Nosferatu

32:30.149 --> 32:33.952
because he looked, he was
perceived to look as hideous.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.622
He doesn't know that yet
and I kinda love that,

32:36.622 --> 32:39.225
I find the beauty in that.

32:39.225 --> 32:42.061
(spooky music)

32:42.061 --> 32:47.066
- Nosferatu actually evokes
this sniffling rodent

32:47.066 --> 32:49.735
that is, I think in a way,

32:49.735 --> 32:52.238
a truer expression
of the character.

32:53.739 --> 32:57.076
And then because of that also
becomes strangely more human.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.214
- 'Cause Murnau
was a gay director,

33:02.214 --> 33:03.649
I think he sort of plays up

33:03.649 --> 33:05.084
some of the gay
undertones in the story.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.020
It features what
some scholars called

33:08.020 --> 33:09.455
the beast in the boudoir motif,

33:09.455 --> 33:11.957
which is where the monster
comes into the bedroom at night.

33:11.957 --> 33:15.127
And in Murnau's version there's
a bedroom seduction scene

33:15.127 --> 33:18.097
between Count Orlok, as
he's called in Noserfatu

33:18.097 --> 33:20.299
and Jonathan Hutter or Harker.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.571
- Having the monster
out at the edge of town

33:25.571 --> 33:27.873
is a horror idea that
we keep coming back to,

33:29.041 --> 33:31.443
but it also sort of
spoke to the place

33:31.443 --> 33:33.845
that queer people
held in society.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.782
- Nosferatu is sort
of a cornerstone

33:36.782 --> 33:41.087
of what we would see over and
over again in vampire cinema

33:41.087 --> 33:43.522
where there's the outsider,

33:43.522 --> 33:46.525
and there's the sexual
nature of the bites

33:46.525 --> 33:49.395
and the entrancement
and so yeah,

33:49.395 --> 33:51.230
he is already, in
the silent era,

33:51.230 --> 33:54.333
bringing this very
kind of queer coding

33:54.333 --> 33:55.834
to this kind of storytelling.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.206
- It's very simple to
find antisemitic overtones

34:00.206 --> 34:04.676
in vampire movies from Stoker

34:04.676 --> 34:07.346
through to Murnau's
film Nosferatu.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.581
In the late 19th century,

34:10.581 --> 34:14.953
many, many Jews arrived in
London from Eastern Europe.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.888
You can easily map the horror

34:16.888 --> 34:19.225
of the Eastern European vampire

34:19.225 --> 34:24.196
to this new cluster of
immigrant communities.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.898
- If I were sort of
around at that time

34:26.898 --> 34:28.766
and I was aware of that bias,

34:28.766 --> 34:31.337
sort of seeing Orlok as
anything other than a gay Jew

34:31.337 --> 34:33.739
would be quite
difficult I think.

34:33.739 --> 34:38.744
- Conflating Jews
and homosexuals as
the evil, as the bad.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.547
The fact that he
utilized any of that

34:41.547 --> 34:44.716
in his making of Nosferatu,
of course it makes sense,

34:44.716 --> 34:47.319
it's good to be good at your
craft and to scare people,

34:47.319 --> 34:49.521
but it's also really,
really dangerous.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.692
- This fear of the other,

34:53.692 --> 34:55.494
whether that other is
homosexual or Jewish

34:55.494 --> 34:57.629
or just an outsider,

34:57.629 --> 35:01.066
he is certainly
relying upon that fear

35:01.066 --> 35:02.734
as a driver of the movie.

35:05.204 --> 35:08.140
- I just think, as a
Jew and as homosexual,

35:08.140 --> 35:11.410
I'm very aware and scared
of these narratives.

35:11.410 --> 35:15.714
- Nosferatu was the
first adaptation

35:15.714 --> 35:19.518
of Bram Stoker's Dracula and
it was an illegal adaptation.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.224
- He's basically doing
unofficial Dracula fan fiction.

35:26.725 --> 35:31.730
- Florence Stoker sued
because it was just a rip off.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.834
There was no royalty
paid to Stoker's estate

35:35.834 --> 35:37.936
for making this
version of Dracula.

35:37.936 --> 35:41.607
- The court ordered every
print of Nosferatu destroyed.

35:41.607 --> 35:46.612
One print survived the
massacre of Nosferatu prints

35:47.746 --> 35:51.149
and that one print gave
birth to every print

35:51.149 --> 35:54.320
that has been circulated
around the world.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.923
If it weren't for one
person who hid that print,

35:57.923 --> 36:00.759
we would not know Nosferatu
the way that we know it today.

36:01.893 --> 36:05.597
Nosferatu became, really
the first cult film.

36:05.597 --> 36:10.602
The Bram Stoker estate actively
hunting down every print

36:11.970 --> 36:14.005
of Nosferatu greatly contributed
to the success of Dracula

36:14.005 --> 36:15.874
because it created this buzz,

36:15.874 --> 36:19.278
at first on Broadway
and then at the movies.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.880
(bats squeal)

36:21.880 --> 36:24.916
(ominous music)

36:24.916 --> 36:26.718
- The early pillars of horror

36:26.718 --> 36:30.589
were these Universal monster
movies starting with Dracula.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.191
(spooky music)

36:37.496 --> 36:40.366
- I am Dracula.

36:40.366 --> 36:43.735
- When I was a kid, I started
buying Aurora model kits

36:43.735 --> 36:46.872
from Famous Monsters
of Filmland magazine.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.842
And I remember my two
sisters on the floor playing

36:50.842 --> 36:53.379
with Barbie and Ken and
I'm up there playing

36:53.379 --> 36:55.814
with Frankenstein
and the Wolfman.

36:55.814 --> 36:59.050
Oh I love them, I love all
the Universal monsters.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.588
I like Dracula the best
because even though

37:02.588 --> 37:04.690
I was a little kid, I
knew he was really sexy.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.325
- Laugh all you like.

37:06.325 --> 37:08.727
I think he's fascinating.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.698
- Bela Lugosi's Dracula
presents as like

37:12.698 --> 37:14.833
if elegance was a gender.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.034
- Is it cyclical?

37:16.034 --> 37:18.304
There are sort of
fashions in vampirism.

37:18.304 --> 37:21.106
Bela Lugosi took over
it from Max Schreck

37:21.106 --> 37:23.309
and Dracula became
much more urbane.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.777
- Bela Lugosi's
Dracula has a certain,

37:25.777 --> 37:28.480
it's this like glide
across the room energy

37:28.480 --> 37:29.981
that I've always wanted.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.585
(woman screams)

37:33.585 --> 37:36.355
- I once had said it was
manic bisexual energy,

37:36.355 --> 37:40.025
but it is manic, pansexual,
omnisexual energy.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.728
- Anything I can do, gladly.

37:42.728 --> 37:46.365
- The Dracula costume
kit is basically drag.

37:46.365 --> 37:51.370
You have face paint and then
you have blood red lips,

37:52.771 --> 37:54.706
and then you slick your hair
back, you put on a cape,

37:54.706 --> 37:57.309
you put on fancy antique jewels.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.210
- I bid you welcome.

37:59.210 --> 38:01.212
- And then you go
live in a castle

38:01.212 --> 38:04.550
and you can turn into a bat.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.251
(bat squeals)

38:06.251 --> 38:11.122
So like, this to me is the
experience of being a gay man.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.693
- I hope you will
find this comfortable.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.929
- Thanks, it looks
very inviting.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.465
- I think if Bram
Stoker were alive,

38:19.465 --> 38:21.833
he'd probably have said
Bela Lugosi was his favorite

38:21.833 --> 38:24.536
because he was
strange and exotic.

38:24.536 --> 38:28.340
- The spider spinning his
we for the unwary fly.

38:28.340 --> 38:31.410
The blood is the
light, Mr. Renfield.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.746
- He had a quality to him.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.281
You didn't think he
was that monstrous.

38:36.281 --> 38:39.050
I mean, when the wolves
are baying and he says.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.318
- Children of the night.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.789
What music they make.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.493
- It's kind of like, oh.

38:47.493 --> 38:50.862
He has an aesthetic soul.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.432
- When Dwight Frye, as Renfield,

38:53.432 --> 38:55.333
first meets Bela
Lugosi's Dracula,

38:55.333 --> 38:57.168
he practically gets the vapors.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.608
- It's really good to see you.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.777
- Dwight Frye commits
kind of a fruity,

39:05.777 --> 39:08.614
over the top,
excessive performance.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.916
- Yes, master.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.752
- And how did he get
to be so over the top?

39:13.752 --> 39:15.153
- It's just a scratch.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.755
- He is bitten by Dracula

39:16.755 --> 39:18.690
in the opening
sequence of the film.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.291
And again, it's quite pronounced

39:20.291 --> 39:22.561
that this is a homoerotic act

39:22.561 --> 39:25.130
because he sort of passes out

39:25.130 --> 39:28.066
and then Dracula
enters the scene

39:28.066 --> 39:30.736
and then he bends down
in almost sort of like

39:30.736 --> 39:33.204
a spider like crouch as he moves

39:33.204 --> 39:35.707
in on the supine Renfield.

39:38.109 --> 39:38.944
- Dracula?

39:46.051 --> 39:49.621
I never even heard
the name before.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.491
- It is a hysterical
over the top performance

39:52.491 --> 39:54.893
that is perceived today
perhaps as being camp.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.828
- Who wants to eat flies?

39:56.828 --> 39:59.364
- You do, ya loony.

39:59.364 --> 40:04.369
- Not when I can get
nice fat spiders.

40:05.537 --> 40:06.738
- It is absolutely a
feeling of connection

40:06.738 --> 40:08.674
that many gay people
have for that character

40:08.674 --> 40:10.642
because it is
being marginalized,

40:10.642 --> 40:12.043
it's being told
that you're crazy,

40:12.043 --> 40:14.245
it's being told that
you don't fit in.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.514
- Come along, now.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.715
Come along.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.450
- Yet absolutely
having a conviction

40:18.450 --> 40:19.885
that nobody else shares.

40:19.885 --> 40:23.121
(Renfield snickers)

40:23.121 --> 40:24.389
- [Man] Why, he's mad.

40:24.389 --> 40:26.191
- The queerness of
that performance,

40:26.191 --> 40:27.893
that's Todd Browning's reaction

40:27.893 --> 40:29.861
to the world outside
of Universal Studios,

40:29.861 --> 40:32.230
which was really
embracing the Pansy Craze.

40:32.230 --> 40:36.167
- Tod Browning's Dracula
came out to the 1931

40:36.167 --> 40:37.836
at the height of
the Pansy Craze.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.939
- The Pansy Craze referred
to drag entertainers

40:40.939 --> 40:43.041
who performed in
mainly nightclubs.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.877
Some of the most
significant pansy clubs

40:45.877 --> 40:47.913
were very close to
Universal Studios

40:47.913 --> 40:50.415
when these horror
films were being made.

40:50.415 --> 40:54.553
At that time, there was
a celebration of gay life

40:54.553 --> 40:57.155
in a very big way in Tinseltown.

40:57.155 --> 41:00.659
All the intelligentsia of
Hollywood came to these clubs

41:00.659 --> 41:02.961
to hear these different
performers and see them

41:02.961 --> 41:05.396
because they were witty, they
were smart, they were fun,

41:05.396 --> 41:09.501
they were outrageous,
and they were daring.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.505
- The wonderful thing
about the Pansy Craze

41:13.505 --> 41:16.274
in cities like New York,
in Los Angeles and London

41:16.274 --> 41:18.276
is this invitation
for the normies

41:18.276 --> 41:19.778
to engage with the queers.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.280
A lot of that had to do with
prohibition and it was one of

41:22.280 --> 41:25.016
the only places where straight
people could get a drink.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.853
- I never drink wine.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.488
- Tod Browning used
a lot of gay actors.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.723
David Manners,

41:31.723 --> 41:34.760
who plays the romantic
interest in Dracula

41:34.760 --> 41:35.594
- Mina.

41:36.828 --> 41:40.265
You're so, like a changed girl.

41:40.265 --> 41:43.234
- Who retired from
films because he was gay

41:43.234 --> 41:45.070
and he couldn't be
cast as a leading man

41:45.070 --> 41:46.404
when people knew
that he was queer.

41:46.404 --> 41:47.706
- What's he done to you, dearie?

41:47.706 --> 41:49.174
Tell me.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.276
- He came to me.

41:51.276 --> 41:56.047
He opened a vein in his
arm and he made me drink.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.583
(gunshot)

41:57.583 --> 42:01.920
- There is this kind of
tragic subtext for Dracula

42:03.121 --> 42:06.592
because he's never
fully in that life

42:06.592 --> 42:09.795
that he's been dealt.

42:09.795 --> 42:13.364
He becomes a perfect
metaphor in many ways,

42:13.364 --> 42:15.266
I think, for queer people.

42:15.266 --> 42:18.503
- What's always
worked for vampires,

42:18.503 --> 42:19.971
even when they're monstrous,

42:21.406 --> 42:24.475
is there's something that we
shouldn't like about them.

42:28.680 --> 42:33.685
- He is meant to be the plague
and so it's very interesting

42:35.020 --> 42:37.989
that there has been
adaptation after adaptation

42:37.989 --> 42:40.826
after adaptation
of the Dracula myth

42:40.826 --> 42:43.428
in which he becomes
the central character.

42:43.428 --> 42:47.132
But in fact, that's not
the story of Dracula.

42:47.132 --> 42:50.602
The story of Dracula is
ordinary people visited

42:50.602 --> 42:53.739
by this terrible force.

42:53.739 --> 42:56.474
- How long have you
had those little marks?

42:56.474 --> 42:57.743
- Marks?

42:57.743 --> 42:59.310
- The interesting
thing is to me,

42:59.310 --> 43:01.913
he has always been a
ambiguous sexual figure.

43:01.913 --> 43:06.918
He is the sort of definition
of forbidden desire,

43:07.653 --> 43:09.520
whatever that may be.

43:11.857 --> 43:13.859
- I think what made
Dracula so timeless

43:13.859 --> 43:16.227
as a character is sex.

43:16.227 --> 43:17.929
(Cassandra laughs)

43:17.929 --> 43:20.766
- I felt it's breath on my face.

43:20.766 --> 43:22.233
And then it's lips.

43:22.233 --> 43:24.770
- Something tapping at
the window is frightening,

43:24.770 --> 43:26.872
but it's also quite sexy

43:26.872 --> 43:28.907
'cause you never know
what it's going to be

43:28.907 --> 43:30.909
and it's massively tied up

43:30.909 --> 43:34.512
in all these kind of
oppressed desires.

43:34.512 --> 43:36.481
It's representing
something very,

43:36.481 --> 43:39.617
very powerful inside us all.

43:39.617 --> 43:44.389
That actually, one night with
Dracula is worth dying for.

43:44.389 --> 43:46.992
(eerie music)

43:53.131 --> 43:56.067
(upbeat pop music)
