WEBVTT

00:08.491 --> 00:11.425
- I have a feeling that,
inside you, somewhere,

00:11.425 --> 00:14.221
there's something
nobody knows about.

00:15.187 --> 00:17.879
- Something nobody knows?

00:17.879 --> 00:19.847
- Something secret
and wonderful,

00:19.847 --> 00:22.056
and I'll find it out.

00:22.056 --> 00:25.232
- [laughs] It's not good to
find out too much, Charlie.

00:25.232 --> 00:28.338
[tense upbeat music]

00:33.412 --> 00:36.588
- James Whale and
Alfred Hitchcock was
sort of the bridge,

00:36.588 --> 00:40.937
to me, between horror
films and queerness.

00:40.937 --> 00:44.078
- Now, you seem very interested
in the subject of murder.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.838
- Well, no more
than anyone else.

00:45.838 --> 00:49.256
- I think you'd be hard
pressed to not find a gay man

00:49.256 --> 00:52.017
who doesn't relate,
at least, [laughs]

00:52.017 --> 00:55.607
to being driven crazy by his
mother's voice in his head.

00:55.607 --> 00:58.713
- [Mother] It's sad when a
mother has to speak the words

00:58.713 --> 01:00.957
that condemn her own son.

01:00.957 --> 01:04.581
- Hitchcock created a picture
that, as soon as you saw it,

01:04.581 --> 01:07.722
you couldn't look away and
you couldn't let go of it.

01:07.722 --> 01:10.449
[menacing music]

01:11.623 --> 01:14.384
- Like Hitchcock,
James Whale's images

01:14.384 --> 01:17.525
in those movies
are so indelible.

01:17.525 --> 01:18.802
I never really know for sure

01:18.802 --> 01:21.184
if I should be
repelled or intrigued.

01:22.358 --> 01:25.568
- Alfred Hitchcock
recognized the fear

01:25.568 --> 01:29.089
surrounding living your
life as a queer person.

01:30.297 --> 01:33.231
- I really like James
Whale in a lot of ways

01:33.231 --> 01:35.543
because I can say "Yes, yes,

01:35.543 --> 01:39.237
it's because he's queer that I
connect with these monsters."

01:39.237 --> 01:41.480
- Hitchcock was making
these gay characters

01:41.480 --> 01:43.379
the more interesting characters

01:43.379 --> 01:45.381
because maybe it
was a part of him.

01:45.381 --> 01:48.246
[slow tense music]

01:49.902 --> 01:52.629
- I think Hitchcock's kind of
weird about sex in general.

01:52.629 --> 01:57.600
I think he finds the whole
thing a little bit unappetizing.

01:58.808 --> 02:00.465
[creepy music]

02:00.465 --> 02:01.811
- James Whale figured out

02:01.811 --> 02:05.263
pretty early on how to
get past the censors.

02:05.263 --> 02:08.128
- Alfred Hitchcock's like
balls out. He's like, "What?"

02:09.025 --> 02:09.853
No rules.

02:09.853 --> 02:12.373
[woman screaming]

02:12.373 --> 02:14.203
- What you see is
filmmakers being

02:14.203 --> 02:18.310
a little bit more explicit
about queer storylines

02:18.310 --> 02:20.623
because they could get
away with them. [laughs]

02:20.623 --> 02:23.419
[slow music]

02:23.419 --> 02:25.317
- Am I giving you
bride? [laughs]

02:28.320 --> 02:30.943

03:02.630 --> 03:05.323
Mark my words. He
will prove dangerous.

03:06.772 --> 03:09.982
- Have you never wanted to do
anything that was dangerous?

03:09.982 --> 03:11.260
- When you talk
about queer cinema,

03:11.260 --> 03:13.020
you have to talk
about James Whale.

03:13.020 --> 03:16.161
[tense music]

03:16.161 --> 03:17.369
- He did all kinds of movies,

03:17.369 --> 03:19.026
but his kind of quartet

03:19.026 --> 03:20.717
of horror movies are
what he's remembered for.

03:20.717 --> 03:23.203
[tense music]

03:25.066 --> 03:26.551
[Bride hissing]

03:26.551 --> 03:30.589
- He created the archetypal
horror film in Hollywood.

03:30.589 --> 03:32.039
- It's alive!

03:32.039 --> 03:34.214
It's alive! It's alive!

03:34.214 --> 03:35.698
It's alive!

03:35.698 --> 03:37.734
- Now, I think with Whale's
films, you can definitely,

03:37.734 --> 03:39.495
you know, he's not
making it hard for you

03:39.495 --> 03:41.048
to do the queer read on them.

03:41.048 --> 03:44.154
[footsteps creaking]

03:46.122 --> 03:49.056
- My name is Femm, Horace Femm.

03:49.056 --> 03:50.851
- There's plenty of
camp in those movies.

03:50.851 --> 03:53.371
It's a, it's almost like
a language, I wanna say,

03:53.371 --> 03:57.237
for queer artists and a coded
way of speaking about society

03:57.237 --> 04:00.101
in a way that society won't
necessarily catch on to.

04:00.101 --> 04:01.344
- Can I take your
coat and hat, sir,

04:01.344 --> 04:03.829
and give 'em a nice
dry in the kitchen?

04:03.829 --> 04:04.796
- No.

04:04.796 --> 04:06.038
[chiming music]

04:06.038 --> 04:07.523
- So, James Whale's
a fascinating figure.

04:07.523 --> 04:10.457
He, you know, serves as
an officer for the British

04:10.457 --> 04:13.874
in World War I, spends a
lot of time in a POW camp,

04:13.874 --> 04:18.465
and in the camp, starts getting
involved in these dramatics,

04:18.465 --> 04:20.363
these little plays
that are being put on

04:20.363 --> 04:22.331
to sort of raise the
morale of the men,

04:22.331 --> 04:23.746
give them something to do,

04:23.746 --> 04:25.575
and that's where he discovers
this love of theater.

04:25.575 --> 04:27.888
[creepy music]

04:27.888 --> 04:29.890
He returns to London
after the war is over.

04:29.890 --> 04:32.306
He winds up directing a
play called "Journey's End,"

04:32.306 --> 04:33.721
which is considered by many

04:33.721 --> 04:36.724
to be like the definitive
World War I play.

04:36.724 --> 04:38.139
So, you know, he,

04:38.139 --> 04:39.900
on the success of
"Journey's End"

04:39.900 --> 04:42.351
goes to Broadway, eventually
goes to Hollywood.

04:42.351 --> 04:44.905
[bomb blasting]

04:44.905 --> 04:45.733
- Hello, Jimmy.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.046
You got one quickly.

04:48.046 --> 04:49.772
- He was an obvious talent,

04:49.772 --> 04:54.017
and he signed a contract with
Carl Laemmle at Universal

04:54.017 --> 04:57.642
and they gave him the
pick of the properties,

04:57.642 --> 05:01.818
and being a homosexual with
a modern sense of humor,

05:01.818 --> 05:03.924
he said, I'll do
"Frankenstein," please.

05:03.924 --> 05:05.374
[thunder rumbling]

05:05.374 --> 05:08.549
- We are about to unfold
the story of "Frankenstein,"

05:08.549 --> 05:10.482
a man of science

05:10.482 --> 05:14.314
who sought to create a
man after his own image

05:14.314 --> 05:16.695
without reckoning upon God.

05:16.695 --> 05:20.078
- Whale created a
groundbreaking film

05:20.078 --> 05:24.910
because he incorporated German
expressionist cinema into it,

05:24.910 --> 05:27.913
camera angles that had
never been used before,

05:27.913 --> 05:31.261
all filtered through the
lens of his queerness.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.161
- He found an actor
in the canteen

05:34.161 --> 05:37.267
at Universal Studios
called Boris Karloff

05:37.267 --> 05:39.649
and said, "I think your
face has possibilities."

05:39.649 --> 05:42.065
[slow music]

05:44.274 --> 05:47.347
- When I think of
monsters, I'm like,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.452
"It's all about Frankenstein."

05:49.452 --> 05:52.455
So classic, such a good look,

05:52.455 --> 05:56.079
a strong brow,
handsome shoulders,

05:56.079 --> 05:57.322
[Frankenstein roaring]

05:57.322 --> 06:00.221
stitched together of
corpse body parts.

06:00.221 --> 06:01.637
I love that guy.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.777
- He's a monster.

06:03.777 --> 06:06.124
And you know, just on
the most basic level,

06:06.124 --> 06:07.436
gay people are called monsters

06:07.436 --> 06:08.644
and have been for a long time.

06:08.644 --> 06:09.921
So, there's that.

06:09.921 --> 06:10.991
- There he is! The murderer!

06:12.026 --> 06:13.821
[crowd shouting]

06:13.821 --> 06:15.582
- If you've been on the
other side of the pitch fork,

06:15.582 --> 06:18.378
you're maybe a little
sympathetic to the monster.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.724
- "Frankenstein's Monster,"

06:19.724 --> 06:21.760
how do you not fall
in love with that oaf?

06:21.760 --> 06:22.934
You know, walking around,

06:22.934 --> 06:24.418
just looking for love

06:24.418 --> 06:26.213
and everybody keeps chasing
him with pitch forks.

06:26.213 --> 06:29.250
[crowd shouting]

06:29.250 --> 06:32.944
This sort of empathy towards
the monster is clearly a draw

06:32.944 --> 06:34.255
for me with the genre.

06:34.255 --> 06:36.982
It kind of begins there.

06:36.982 --> 06:38.294
- The monster is innocent.

06:40.123 --> 06:41.746
He is brought into being.

06:41.746 --> 06:45.577
He is what he is, and it is the
society that is the monster.

06:45.577 --> 06:49.063
[crowd shouting]

06:49.063 --> 06:51.203
- The monster never
did anything to nobody.

06:51.203 --> 06:55.173
He just, he's an innocent,
in a real sense of the word,

06:55.173 --> 06:57.140
but he looks real
scary to people

06:57.140 --> 06:59.280
because they don't get him.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.247
[bride screaming]

07:00.247 --> 07:01.766
[Frankenstein growling]

07:01.766 --> 07:03.319
- There's something about
Frankenstein as a monster

07:03.319 --> 07:06.287
that I think speaks to a
really quintessential part

07:06.287 --> 07:07.496
of queer experience

07:07.496 --> 07:09.808
and that like you
don't always realize

07:09.808 --> 07:11.189
that you're different, right?

07:11.189 --> 07:12.673
And once you do,

07:12.673 --> 07:17.057
you realize that society sees
you as something monstrous.

07:17.057 --> 07:18.783
It's like this
internalized self loathing.

07:18.783 --> 07:21.613
[crowd muttering]

07:24.374 --> 07:26.618
- Horror has always been
interwoven very deeply

07:26.618 --> 07:28.102
with the idea of what it means

07:28.102 --> 07:30.588
to be someone who is
not accepted by society

07:30.588 --> 07:32.417
but nevertheless has a soul.

07:32.417 --> 07:35.524
- Would you like
one of my flowers?

07:35.524 --> 07:37.802
- [Emily] Which is the story
of Frankenstein's monster

07:37.802 --> 07:38.837
in particular.

07:42.945 --> 07:45.810
- "Frankenstein" is one of
the first movies I heard

07:45.810 --> 07:50.815
of having a like
clear queer parallel.

07:51.540 --> 07:51.954
- Is anything wrong?

07:52.782 --> 07:54.404
- I've felt it all day.

07:54.404 --> 07:56.476
Something is coming between us.

07:57.373 --> 07:58.857
I know it.

07:58.857 --> 08:00.307
I know it.

08:00.307 --> 08:03.862
- When you look at James
Whale directing "Frankenstein"

08:03.862 --> 08:06.313
and you look at the queer
theory surrounding it,

08:06.313 --> 08:09.765
it is almost always
the homosexual subtext

08:09.765 --> 08:12.802
because James Whale was
a homosexual director.

08:12.802 --> 08:16.150
But what gets lost is the
transgender narrative.

08:16.150 --> 08:17.393
- Think of it,

08:17.393 --> 08:20.500
the brain of a dead man
waiting to live again

08:20.500 --> 08:23.261
in a body I made
with my own hands,

08:24.262 --> 08:25.988
with my own hands.

08:25.988 --> 08:27.610
- "Frankenstein"
is about the idea

08:27.610 --> 08:29.198
that science might
subvert the ways

08:29.198 --> 08:30.889
that God has set
up the universe.

08:30.889 --> 08:35.687
There is this element of
science helping you find

08:35.687 --> 08:40.692
your true form that
is not, not trans,

08:42.142 --> 08:44.765
but also society regards
that science as ghoulish.

08:44.765 --> 08:48.251
Every day, trans people are
playing God for themselves.

08:48.251 --> 08:49.080
- It's moving.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.772
[thunder rumbling]

08:51.772 --> 08:53.015
- They are saying,

08:53.015 --> 08:56.363
I'm going to reanimate
the parts of myself

08:56.363 --> 08:58.538
that everyone has told
me should be dead.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.162
- Now I know what it
feels like to be God!

09:02.162 --> 09:03.853
- That powerful metaphor creates

09:03.853 --> 09:06.546
within us this kinship
with this monster

09:06.546 --> 09:08.306
who really doesn't
deserve what comes to him.

09:08.306 --> 09:11.067
[menacing music]

09:11.067 --> 09:13.622
[dogs barking]

09:16.556 --> 09:19.593
- "Frankenstein," which
was an immensely popular

09:19.593 --> 09:20.836
and famous film.

09:20.836 --> 09:22.492
[dramatic music]

09:22.492 --> 09:23.942
- James Whale was,
by that point,

09:23.942 --> 09:26.566
becoming number one or number
two director at Universal,

09:26.566 --> 09:29.499
so he could have a little more
freedom to do what he wanted.

09:29.499 --> 09:33.193

09:33.193 --> 09:38.198
[creepy music]
[rain dribbling]

09:39.993 --> 09:41.201
- Good evening.

09:41.201 --> 09:43.065
- I really love "The
Old Dark House."

09:43.065 --> 09:46.793
I love the way that he seems
to be inventing a genre

09:46.793 --> 09:48.035
and satirizing it.

09:48.035 --> 09:50.866
[creepy music]

09:50.866 --> 09:53.800
[thunder rumbling]

09:55.767 --> 09:58.045
You are witnessing
construction and deconstruction

09:58.045 --> 09:58.977
at the same time.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.808
[man laughing]

10:01.808 --> 10:04.362
He's giving us the, you know,

10:04.362 --> 10:05.743
it was a darken
and stormy night,

10:05.743 --> 10:08.331
the spooky house and
the weird people inside

10:08.331 --> 10:11.058
and the don't go in that room
and all of that kind of stuff.

10:11.058 --> 10:11.887
[woman screams]

10:11.887 --> 10:13.405
And at the same time,

10:13.405 --> 10:17.375
there's such a tongue in cheek
attitude to the whole thing.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.928
- I'm dreadfully wet
and I would be so glad

10:18.928 --> 10:20.758
if I could go and
change my clothes?

10:20.758 --> 10:21.931
- What?

10:21.931 --> 10:23.484
- I wondered if I
might change my things.

10:23.484 --> 10:25.314
- You look wet. You better
go and change your things.

10:25.314 --> 10:29.594
- There's an incredibly
effeminate gentleman

10:29.594 --> 10:31.113
running the house.

10:31.113 --> 10:34.634
- My sister was on the point
of arranging these flowers.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
[mischievous music]

10:36.636 --> 10:39.500
- And then he is got like a
really dykey lesbian sister.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.572
- You think of nothing but
your long straight legs

10:42.572 --> 10:45.299
and your white body and
how to please your man.

10:45.299 --> 10:46.991
- Thinly veiled, thinly veiled.

10:46.991 --> 10:50.132
Then there's like a hundred
and something year old man

10:50.132 --> 10:51.789
like tucked away in
a room somewhere.

10:51.789 --> 10:52.997
- Who are you?

10:54.239 --> 10:57.104
- I'm Mrs. Waverton.
This is my husband.

10:57.104 --> 10:58.554
Are you Sir Roderick Femm?

10:58.554 --> 11:00.901
- Who's fully played
by a woman in a beard.

11:00.901 --> 11:02.834
- You shouldn't have come here.

11:02.834 --> 11:06.113
- "The Old Dark House" is
really spectacularly queer.

11:06.113 --> 11:09.634
- Well, there's no accounting
for tastes, you know? [laughs]

11:10.877 --> 11:12.085
- No.

11:12.085 --> 11:16.020
- Ernest Thesiger was
a wonderful actor,

11:16.020 --> 11:20.749
a decorated war hero, and
an absolute screaming queen.

11:20.749 --> 11:21.853
- This is my room.

11:21.853 --> 11:22.682
- Huh?

11:24.131 --> 11:25.685
- There are one of two things
that I should very much like

11:25.685 --> 11:26.824
for you to see.

11:26.824 --> 11:28.549
- He was a great
friend of Queen Mary's.

11:28.549 --> 11:29.930
They used to embroider together.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.967
- It's only gin, you know.

11:31.967 --> 11:34.417
Only gin. I like gin.

11:35.556 --> 11:37.731
- Thesiger was a
female impersonator

11:37.731 --> 11:41.493
and kind of a bawdy musical
comedian and he brings that

11:41.493 --> 11:43.875
to all of his film
performances for Whale.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.739
- You will have to stay here.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.190
The misfortune is
yours, not ours.

11:48.190 --> 11:49.916
- No beds. They can't have beds.

11:49.916 --> 11:54.368
- As my sister hints, there
are, I'm afraid, no beds.

11:54.368 --> 11:56.992
- "The Old Dark House" starts
to build the camp sensibility

11:56.992 --> 11:59.166
and humor of James Whale's work

11:59.166 --> 12:01.479
that we didn't really
see in "Frankenstein."

12:01.479 --> 12:04.240
[wind whipping]

12:04.240 --> 12:05.483
[woman screaming]

12:05.483 --> 12:07.899
It's really a muscle
building exercise

12:07.899 --> 12:11.592
that allows him to tell stories
like "The Invisible Man."

12:11.592 --> 12:14.147
[creepy music]

12:14.147 --> 12:15.527
- James Whale's
third horror film

12:15.527 --> 12:17.184
for Universal was
"The Invisible Man,"

12:17.184 --> 12:18.876
which is another
one of those stories

12:18.876 --> 12:21.223
about a scientist who
forsakes his girlfriend

12:21.223 --> 12:23.466
in order to do these
mad experiments.

12:23.466 --> 12:24.571
- Why did you do this?

12:24.571 --> 12:27.022
- Power, power to rule,

12:27.022 --> 12:29.162
to make the world
grovel at my feet.

12:29.162 --> 12:33.028
- Also pre-code, "The Invisible
Man" is really violent,

12:33.028 --> 12:35.340
really deviant, and
you have this madness

12:35.340 --> 12:37.135
that gives you a sense
of Whale's playfulness

12:37.135 --> 12:38.136
as a storyteller.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.175
- He's here, the Invisible Man!

12:42.175 --> 12:44.591
[woman screaming]

12:44.591 --> 12:47.767
- We'll begin with
a reign of terror,

12:47.767 --> 12:49.699
a few murders here and there.

12:49.699 --> 12:51.909
We might even break
a train or two.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.187
[train engine rumbling]

12:54.187 --> 12:55.878
[Invisible Man laughing]

12:55.878 --> 12:57.293
- It might have been

12:57.293 --> 13:01.470
one of the first maniacally
cackling villains

13:01.470 --> 13:02.885
that I had ever seen.

13:02.885 --> 13:06.371
- I'll show you who I am
and what I am! [laughs]

13:08.408 --> 13:12.170
- Just, I mean that
cliche of the monster

13:12.170 --> 13:16.209
who is so delighted
by his own evil

13:16.209 --> 13:18.694
that he just can't
keep from giggling,

13:18.694 --> 13:21.179
and I'm sure I was influenced.

13:21.179 --> 13:23.595
[Chucky laughing]

13:23.595 --> 13:25.183
- The concept of
"The Invisible Man,"

13:25.183 --> 13:26.875
and of course,
there's the, you know,

13:26.875 --> 13:29.291
the book about the Black
experience, "The Invisible Man,"

13:29.291 --> 13:31.983
but this idea of a person
who was living among others

13:31.983 --> 13:33.813
but can't be seen by them,

13:33.813 --> 13:37.333
I was very aware that
other people were aware

13:37.333 --> 13:41.268
that I was Black immediately
in every situation,

13:41.268 --> 13:42.718
but queer, not so much,

13:42.718 --> 13:44.685
and even in the Black
community that I came up in,

13:44.685 --> 13:46.687
it really was not,

13:46.687 --> 13:48.724
to be a man and to be
gay were not two things

13:48.724 --> 13:50.899
that you could be
at the same time.

13:50.899 --> 13:52.383
I think that that's probably

13:52.383 --> 13:54.040
where the invisibility
thing comes in

13:54.040 --> 13:57.802
because having to hide was
just a part of the fabric

13:57.802 --> 14:00.080
of my understanding
of how to live.

14:00.080 --> 14:04.050
- Huh? How do you like
that, eh? [laughs]

14:04.050 --> 14:08.226
- James Whale is amazing for
how brilliant his movies were

14:08.226 --> 14:13.093
and how far they went and he
was able to do that pre-code,

14:13.093 --> 14:15.475
because at that
point, anything went.

14:15.475 --> 14:17.822
[woman screaming]

14:17.822 --> 14:19.893
♪ Here we go gathering
nuts in May ♪

14:19.893 --> 14:21.826
♪ Nuts in May, nuts in May

14:21.826 --> 14:23.552
♪ Here we go gathering
nuts in May ♪

14:23.552 --> 14:25.761
♪ On a cold and
frosty morning. ♪

14:25.761 --> 14:28.384
- Hollywood had been
suspect for its morals

14:28.384 --> 14:30.870
and sort of licentious
images on the screen,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.734
[Invisible Man groaning]

14:33.734 --> 14:36.910
and the Catholics and the
Protestants were very concerned

14:36.910 --> 14:39.706
about Hollywood ruining
the morals of America.

14:39.706 --> 14:41.604
- That's fine stuff,
but it'll rot.

14:42.605 --> 14:44.159
That's finer stuff still,

14:44.159 --> 14:45.850
but it'll rot too in time.

14:45.850 --> 14:47.679
- Don't! How dare you?

14:48.853 --> 14:50.096
- There was a seat
change in Hollywood

14:50.096 --> 14:52.719
at the end of 1933
going into 1934

14:52.719 --> 14:55.204
with the advancement
of the Hayes Codes.

14:55.204 --> 14:58.690
- The code sets up high
standards of performance

14:58.690 --> 15:01.176
for a motion picture producer.

15:01.176 --> 15:04.524
It states the considerations
which good taste

15:04.524 --> 15:08.079
and community value
make necessary

15:08.079 --> 15:11.911
in this universal
form of entertainment.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.498
- The Hays Code was something

15:13.498 --> 15:15.707
that was written
by a Jesuit priest

15:15.707 --> 15:18.918
and the intention was that
it was a set of standards

15:18.918 --> 15:21.023
for film productions to follow.

15:21.023 --> 15:22.438
[typewriter clicking]
- You can't intimate

15:22.438 --> 15:25.096
homosexuality, you
can't show immorality.

15:25.096 --> 15:27.927
- [BJ] Seductive dancing,
interracial kissing,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.929
excessive use of
drugs and alcohol.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.999
[typewriter bell rings]

15:30.999 --> 15:33.311
- So, in "Frankenstein"
for example,

15:33.311 --> 15:36.314
when the film was
released after 1934,

15:36.314 --> 15:39.455
i.e. after the production code
seal of approval was put in,

15:39.455 --> 15:40.940
- No!

15:40.940 --> 15:43.287
- Both the drowning of the
little girl was cut out

15:44.667 --> 15:47.118
as well as the line
about playing God.

15:47.118 --> 15:48.844
- In the name of God,

15:48.844 --> 15:51.778
now I know it feels
like to be God!

15:53.193 --> 15:55.851
- Certainly, when the code
came in, what was great,

15:55.851 --> 15:57.266
you saw him doing somersaults

15:57.266 --> 15:59.027
and you saw him
figuring out new ways

15:59.027 --> 16:02.444
to put meaning into
his material in a way

16:02.444 --> 16:04.135
that he could get
it past the censors.

16:04.135 --> 16:06.206
- He was dealing in
horror and fantasy.

16:06.206 --> 16:07.690
And so, when the
censors would come in

16:07.690 --> 16:09.865
and tell him he
couldn't do things,

16:09.865 --> 16:13.006
it was like, but
this is not real.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.457
This is somebody's dream.

16:15.457 --> 16:18.046
- When you have these
fantastical movies

16:18.046 --> 16:21.118
with these imaginary creatures,

16:21.118 --> 16:22.878
it could, the story can
be whatever you want.

16:22.878 --> 16:25.881
[upbeat band music]

16:32.232 --> 16:34.027
- He agrees, I think
somewhat against his will,

16:34.027 --> 16:36.374
to do a sequel to
"Frankenstein."

16:36.374 --> 16:38.342
- Nothing can persuade me.

16:38.342 --> 16:39.170
- We shall see.

16:40.309 --> 16:41.793
[creepy music]

16:41.793 --> 16:43.209
- No, not that.

16:43.209 --> 16:46.453
- Oh, he's quite harmless,
except when crossed.

16:46.453 --> 16:49.146
[creepy music]

16:49.146 --> 16:50.699
- If you just sort of go into it

16:50.699 --> 16:52.528
thinking he's gonna be the
return of "Frankenstein,"

16:52.528 --> 16:54.323
then you should steady yourself

16:54.323 --> 16:57.326
because it's an
absolutely bizarre film.

16:57.326 --> 16:59.673
[scary music]

16:59.673 --> 17:01.296
- She's alive!

17:01.296 --> 17:02.573
Alive!

17:02.573 --> 17:04.575
- James Whale's fourth
and final horror film

17:04.575 --> 17:06.991
for Universal is the
"Bride of Frankenstein,"

17:06.991 --> 17:10.305
and this film is really
quite a remarkable reworking,

17:10.305 --> 17:14.033
inversion, deconstruction of
all of the horror movie tropes.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.449
It's really Whale kind
of doing what he wants

17:16.449 --> 17:19.590
and sending up the conventions
of the production code.

17:19.590 --> 17:22.972
He puts all of this kind of
subversive stuff into the film

17:22.972 --> 17:25.285
that just flew over the
head of the censors.

17:25.285 --> 17:26.528
- Henry! Henry!

17:27.563 --> 17:31.498
Henry! Henry! [sobbing]

17:31.498 --> 17:32.879
- I guess the question is,

17:32.879 --> 17:35.054
is how gay is "Bride
of Frankenstein?"

17:35.054 --> 17:38.195
And to me, it's very gay,

17:38.195 --> 17:42.061
but I think we have to
ask the question of,

17:42.061 --> 17:44.856
how gay do they mean it to be?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.548
And the answer is
very complicated.

17:46.548 --> 17:49.447
[slow music]

17:49.447 --> 17:52.209
[Una whimpering]

17:53.520 --> 17:55.004
[Una shouting]

17:55.004 --> 17:56.523
I really don't
think he was trying

17:56.523 --> 17:59.078
to make a campy gay movie.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.011
I think he was trying to
make something compelling

18:02.011 --> 18:03.392
and entertaining and emotional.

18:03.392 --> 18:05.084
- Before you came,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.051
I was all alone.

18:07.051 --> 18:09.433
It is bad to be alone.

18:09.433 --> 18:12.574
- Alone, bad.

18:13.402 --> 18:15.542
Friend, good.

18:15.542 --> 18:17.372
- I think he was trying
to make a serious movie

18:17.372 --> 18:19.719
but I think he
understood entertainment.

18:19.719 --> 18:21.824
- Why have you
come here tonight?

18:21.824 --> 18:24.413
- My business with
you, Baron, is private.

18:25.863 --> 18:27.416
- The whole movie is predicated

18:27.416 --> 18:30.281
on a marriage being interrupted

18:30.281 --> 18:32.214
so that these two men
can go off together

18:32.214 --> 18:35.390
and create life their
way, their special way.

18:35.390 --> 18:36.908
You know? [laughs]

18:36.908 --> 18:39.773
- He literally yanks that
man from his bed chamber

18:39.773 --> 18:42.362
where he's about to have
sex with his wife, I assume,

18:42.362 --> 18:44.157
and like he's like,
come together,

18:44.157 --> 18:47.022
make a baby with me, Dr.
Frankenstein. [laughs]

18:47.022 --> 18:48.748
- If you, Herr Baron,
will do me the honor

18:48.748 --> 18:50.750
of visiting my humble abode,

18:50.750 --> 18:53.580
I think you'll be interested
in what I have to show you.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.099
- Every time I watch
"Bride of Frankenstein,"

18:55.099 --> 18:57.584
I forget there's a scene
with weird little people

18:57.584 --> 18:59.379
that live in glass cases.

18:59.379 --> 19:00.794
And I'm like, what is this?

19:00.794 --> 19:02.762
- There's a certain resemblance
to me, don't you think?

19:02.762 --> 19:04.695
Or do I flatter myself?

19:04.695 --> 19:09.700
- Pretorius, is sexless,
manipulative, properly evil.

19:11.011 --> 19:14.187
- There are always
accidental deaths occurring.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.671
- Always.

19:15.671 --> 19:19.848
- With this bizarre agenda
for creating life without sex.

19:19.848 --> 19:22.402
- Shall we put the heart in now?

19:22.402 --> 19:23.645
- Yes.

19:23.645 --> 19:27.027
- One of the ways that
James Whale was fearless

19:27.027 --> 19:29.168
in making "Bride of
Frankenstein" was just the way

19:29.168 --> 19:32.792
he directed Ernest Thesiger
to play the character

19:32.792 --> 19:36.934
of Dr. Pretorius, 'cause he
is so camp and such a queen.

19:36.934 --> 19:40.834
- I can't be the first person
to to call him Dr. Gay Torius.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.388
I cannot be the first
person to do that.

19:42.388 --> 19:45.287
- Alone, you have created a man.

19:45.287 --> 19:48.842
Now, together, we
will create his mate.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.500
- You know, he does this
thing with his hands

19:51.500 --> 19:53.261
where he like
splays his fingers.

19:53.261 --> 19:54.193
He goes,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.125
- The Bride of Frankenstein.

19:56.125 --> 19:59.646
- Like he's the
bride's publicist.

19:59.646 --> 20:02.408
- Whale was able to
use his queer friends

20:02.408 --> 20:03.961
in the most delightful ways.

20:03.961 --> 20:06.860
- You've got this
gaggle of queer actors.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.103
You've got Elsa Lanchester.

20:08.103 --> 20:09.138
You've got Colin Clive.

20:09.138 --> 20:10.416
You've got Ernest Thesiger.

20:10.416 --> 20:11.589
You've got Una O'Connor.

20:11.589 --> 20:13.902
- Let them all be
murdered in their beds.

20:13.902 --> 20:17.008
- Una O'Connor is
a hilarious leader

20:17.008 --> 20:18.838
of the torch bearing villagers.

20:18.838 --> 20:22.738
- That's the best bar I ever
saw in all me life. [laughs]

20:22.738 --> 20:26.259
- In "The Invisible Man"
and "Bride of Frankenstein,"

20:26.259 --> 20:27.433
that you're just playing

20:27.433 --> 20:30.988
similar Gladys Kravitz
type characters,

20:30.988 --> 20:32.438
like that annoying neighbor

20:32.438 --> 20:34.785
who's just not gonna
leave it alone.

20:35.648 --> 20:36.856
[Una screaming]

20:36.856 --> 20:39.583
- Whoa, look!
Milady, he's alive!

20:39.583 --> 20:44.553
- James Whale gave them the
freedom to be who they are

20:45.761 --> 20:47.246
because he knew who
they were inside,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.869
and thus, was able to
bring out something in them

20:49.869 --> 20:51.388
that they were safe to express,

20:51.388 --> 20:53.942
which they could not ever
do with any other director.

20:53.942 --> 20:55.978
- It is interesting
to think, Henry,

20:55.978 --> 20:58.118
that once upon a time,
we should have been burnt

20:58.118 --> 21:00.776
at the stake as wizards
for this experiment.

21:00.776 --> 21:04.504
- Whale got much more dangerous

21:04.504 --> 21:07.162
and aggressive and
transformative,

21:07.162 --> 21:12.167
and he created a really,
really queer female protagonist

21:12.892 --> 21:14.169
who is basically saying,

21:14.169 --> 21:17.690
"I don't want that guy
that you made for me."

21:17.690 --> 21:20.002
[Bride screaming]

21:20.002 --> 21:24.213
- Her entire reason for
existence is to be the mate of,

21:24.213 --> 21:26.837
you know, the man
they've created

21:26.837 --> 21:30.116
and does not, not interested,

21:30.116 --> 21:31.497
would rather not, thank you.

21:31.497 --> 21:33.015
We'll pass.

21:33.015 --> 21:35.328
- She was created for him and
she was like, no thank you.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.192
- I don't think so.

21:37.192 --> 21:39.677
I don't want him. No!

21:39.677 --> 21:41.161
- No, that's not happening.

21:41.161 --> 21:42.991
- Absolutely not.
Who is this man?

21:42.991 --> 21:45.234
- I wanna have control
of my own body.

21:45.234 --> 21:47.409
I wanna have control
of my own sexuality,

21:47.409 --> 21:49.342
and I wanna go find
who I wanna find.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.862
- "Bride of Frankenstein"
is like a peak bad bitch.

21:51.862 --> 21:54.243
- She was able to
just be like, mm-mm.

21:56.591 --> 21:58.075
I was really struck by that

21:58.075 --> 22:00.422
'cause it just didn't
occur to me that you could,

22:00.422 --> 22:01.803
that you could say, no.

22:01.803 --> 22:04.806
- I mean I think it's
important for all women to see,

22:04.806 --> 22:06.808
like "No" is a
complete sentence.

22:06.808 --> 22:08.810
- There's no like
learning curve for her.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.053
There's no section of the story

22:11.053 --> 22:12.952
where you see her like
try to make it work.

22:12.952 --> 22:16.024
No, she just wakes up and
she is like, absolutely not.

22:16.024 --> 22:18.785
- You have created
life, and I'm alive,

22:18.785 --> 22:21.754
which means that I have a mind
of my own and my own ideas

22:21.754 --> 22:23.134
about what I would like to do,

22:23.134 --> 22:24.653
and isn't that
fucking terrifying?

22:24.653 --> 22:26.068
- She was like, I
don't even want him.

22:26.068 --> 22:27.691
- We don't know what
her preference was

22:27.691 --> 22:29.209
but we know it wasn't him.

22:29.209 --> 22:34.214
- It was just a singular
"No" in a long line of no's

22:35.699 --> 22:39.047
that I needed to be
able to hear women say

22:39.047 --> 22:44.052
before I could fully
embrace my own "No."

22:44.639 --> 22:46.848
[slow music]

22:48.159 --> 22:50.058
[Frankenstein whimpering]

22:50.058 --> 22:51.335
[Bride screaming]

22:51.335 --> 22:53.441
- So many times these
monsters get agency

22:53.441 --> 22:55.408
and they have power
like queer people,

22:55.408 --> 22:57.893
but in the end,
they have to die,

22:57.893 --> 23:00.068
and in fact, they
often kill themselves.

23:00.068 --> 23:01.345
- He pushes Frankenstein

23:01.345 --> 23:04.003
and his bride out of
the castle and says,

23:04.003 --> 23:05.245
- Go. You live.

23:07.006 --> 23:07.834
Go.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.042
[tense music]

23:09.042 --> 23:10.043
You'll stay.

23:11.286 --> 23:13.012
- We belong dead.

23:13.012 --> 23:14.634
- We belong dead.

23:14.634 --> 23:16.602
[Bride hissing]

23:16.602 --> 23:19.605
[dramatic music]

23:19.605 --> 23:21.020
- He doesn't just take
the bride with him.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.470
He takes Pretorius with him

23:22.470 --> 23:26.128
'cause he knows that they're
all unnatural together.

23:26.128 --> 23:28.130
It's glorious. [laughs]

23:28.130 --> 23:33.135
[bombs exploding]
[upbeat dramatic music]

23:36.276 --> 23:38.727
- What he was able to
bring in terms of queerness

23:38.727 --> 23:41.143
to that film is remarkable

23:41.143 --> 23:45.665
because the film is
absolutely a chronicle

23:45.665 --> 23:48.357
of queer life in an odd way

23:48.357 --> 23:51.740
because of these different
archetypal characters.

23:51.740 --> 23:55.675
It's about the creation and
the demise of the monster,

23:55.675 --> 23:58.885
but also, it's
looking at the demise

23:58.885 --> 24:03.787
of the acceptance of gay life
as it was known in Hollywood.

24:04.926 --> 24:07.825
It's the culmination
of of Whale's expertise

24:07.825 --> 24:08.999
and his life's work,

24:08.999 --> 24:10.932
even though he had no idea

24:10.932 --> 24:14.453
that this was really the
beginning of the end for him.

24:14.453 --> 24:18.008
[dramatic music]

24:18.008 --> 24:20.355
- As his longtime partner
David Lewis would later put it,

24:20.355 --> 24:23.151
you know, he never shouted
it from the rooftops,

24:23.151 --> 24:25.153
but he was never in
the closet either.

24:26.810 --> 24:30.054
- Everybody knew about him and
he was not, he didn't hide.

24:30.054 --> 24:31.539
He didn't have a double life.

24:31.539 --> 24:35.474
He didn't have a wife and
a bunch of kids as a cover.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.027
He lived a gay life.

24:38.649 --> 24:40.375
- It depends on who you ask

24:40.375 --> 24:45.380
whether or not Whale's queerness
was an issue in his career.

24:46.554 --> 24:47.727
Certainly, if you
look at, you know,

24:47.727 --> 24:48.970
Bill Condon's "Gods
and Monsters,"

24:48.970 --> 24:50.730
he was too much
for the industry.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.007
They couldn't deal with him,

24:52.007 --> 24:53.975
and that's sort of why
he gets pushed aside.

24:53.975 --> 24:56.149
But there are other people
who were his contemporaries

24:56.149 --> 24:58.738
who were like, "No, he made
some movies that bombed

24:58.738 --> 25:01.085
and just kind of fell out
of favor with the studio."

25:01.085 --> 25:03.674
So, you know, it's
one of those things

25:03.674 --> 25:06.574
where historians
can't really agree.

25:06.574 --> 25:08.230
I would certainly say, they
would probably all agree

25:08.230 --> 25:10.543
that his being, you know,

25:10.543 --> 25:14.098
unapologetically out in the
1940s was probably not seen

25:14.098 --> 25:15.514
as a career boost.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.170
[chiming music]

25:17.170 --> 25:19.518
- He managed to become
a major league director

25:19.518 --> 25:24.523
in a town that was, on the
face of it, totally homophobic.

25:25.247 --> 25:27.387
- He did commit suicide.

25:27.387 --> 25:32.392
Yet, in his suicide
note, he said,

25:33.532 --> 25:36.258
- [James] To all I love,
do not grieve for me.

25:36.258 --> 25:37.777
My nerves are shot.

25:37.777 --> 25:42.264
And for the last year, I've
been in agony day and night.

25:43.438 --> 25:47.338
I've had a wonderful
life, but it is over.

25:47.338 --> 25:51.757
So, please forgive
me, all those I love,

25:52.827 --> 25:54.656
and may God forgive me too.

25:55.795 --> 26:00.351
Goodbye, and thank
you for all your love.

26:01.939 --> 26:05.943
I must have peace, Jimmy.

26:05.943 --> 26:09.119
[contemplative music]

26:14.573 --> 26:15.850
- [Interviewer] Mr. Hitchcock,

26:15.850 --> 26:17.679
why do you always
make mystery film?

26:19.094 --> 26:22.339
- Well, life is a big
mystery. Isn't it?

26:22.339 --> 26:24.410
It always has been.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.930
I think people are
intrigued by mystery

26:28.345 --> 26:31.900
to find out about things they
don't know anything about.

26:32.763 --> 26:33.730
That's a mystery.

26:33.730 --> 26:35.283
[dramatic music]

26:35.283 --> 26:36.905
- [Norman] Mother? Oh God!

26:36.905 --> 26:39.839
Mother! Blood, blood.

26:39.839 --> 26:42.980
[chiming music]

26:42.980 --> 26:44.464
- For queer people
who get so little

26:44.464 --> 26:46.570
of ourselves reflected
back to us by culture,

26:46.570 --> 26:49.090
we tend to pick up on
the things that we get.

26:49.090 --> 26:50.781
[chiming music]

26:50.781 --> 26:52.472
Especially those
powerful images,

26:52.472 --> 26:55.027
and Hitchcock, if nothing else,

26:55.027 --> 26:57.685
he knew how to create a
powerful image that would live

26:57.685 --> 26:58.858
in your heart and soul.

26:58.858 --> 27:01.136
[creepy music]

27:01.136 --> 27:02.344
In a Hitchcock movie,

27:02.344 --> 27:05.106
no image is sort of
just there by accident.

27:05.106 --> 27:08.074
Every image is there
specifically, almost like using,

27:08.074 --> 27:09.731
you know, words in a sentence.

27:09.731 --> 27:12.320
[creepy music]

27:14.115 --> 27:17.290
Hitchcock's filmmaking feels
queer in a number of ways.

27:19.051 --> 27:23.952
He has an eye for feminine
detail that is unique to him

27:23.952 --> 27:25.367
as a filmmaker.

27:25.367 --> 27:29.406
He uses a lot of female
artifacts, things that, frankly,

27:29.406 --> 27:32.029
male directors would normally
not even really notice

27:32.029 --> 27:35.101
or pick up on or think
to isolate in a closeup

27:35.101 --> 27:36.344
to tell their story.

27:37.828 --> 27:41.176
- It's interesting
with Hitchcock because
I think he was,

27:41.176 --> 27:42.661
[thunder rumbling]

27:42.661 --> 27:46.975
wrestling with both an
awe and a hatred of women

27:48.494 --> 27:50.945
and expressions of femininity,

27:50.945 --> 27:54.776
along with a very modern desire

27:54.776 --> 27:58.331
to represent a lot of
different kinds of characters

27:58.331 --> 27:59.919
who also might be queer.

27:59.919 --> 28:02.232
- That's the most thrilling
compliment I ever got.

28:02.232 --> 28:03.889
- For me, one of the
interesting parallels

28:03.889 --> 28:07.513
to queer Hollywood was
queer Britain in the 1920s,

28:07.513 --> 28:09.308
where cinema was bursting

28:09.308 --> 28:11.759
with all kinds of
queer inspiration,

28:11.759 --> 28:16.246
and Alfred Hitchcock
was part of that world.

28:16.246 --> 28:20.491
He worked with a
lot of queer talent,

28:20.491 --> 28:23.563
going back to Ivor
Novello with "The Lodger."

28:23.563 --> 28:27.326
Ivor Novello was a matinee
idol in early cinema.

28:27.326 --> 28:29.742
Hitchcock knew exactly
what he was doing

28:29.742 --> 28:32.055
when he cast Novello.

28:32.055 --> 28:34.367
And he knew exactly
what he was doing

28:34.367 --> 28:37.060
when he cast Charles
Laughton in "Jamaica Inn."

28:37.060 --> 28:38.440
- See, Lady Beston,
that's why he stays here

28:38.440 --> 28:40.304
and never comes
to London anymore.

28:40.304 --> 28:42.203
He keeps a girl
here, the monster.

28:42.203 --> 28:43.135
- There she is,

28:44.377 --> 28:46.276
my exquisite Nancy.

28:46.276 --> 28:49.141
[horse neighing]

28:49.141 --> 28:51.868
- Laughton was a
brilliant, brilliant actor

28:51.868 --> 28:54.042
who was a very conflicted man.

28:54.042 --> 28:55.906
- She was going to
tell you about me.

28:56.769 --> 28:57.839
I didn't like that.

28:57.839 --> 28:59.323
- You know Charles Laughton,

28:59.323 --> 29:01.981
married for a very long
time to to Elsa Lanchester,

29:01.981 --> 29:04.743
tormented by his bisexuality,

29:04.743 --> 29:06.261
if not his homosexuality.

29:06.261 --> 29:08.263
He has a certain famous,

29:08.263 --> 29:11.370
in Hitchcock adaptation of
du Maurier's "Jamaica Inn."

29:11.370 --> 29:13.165
- [Humphrey] Please be still.

29:13.165 --> 29:15.270
[tense music]

29:15.270 --> 29:16.513
- [Alonso] In his era,

29:16.513 --> 29:18.584
no other filmmaker had
queer representation

29:18.584 --> 29:19.999
like Alfred Hitchcock.

29:21.173 --> 29:22.622
- We want a private
suite with a bath.

29:22.622 --> 29:23.554
- Facing the mountain.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.521
- And a shower, of course.

29:24.521 --> 29:25.867
- Hot and cold.

29:25.867 --> 29:26.799
- And a private
thingummy if you got one.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.042
- Well, I'm sorry gentleman,

29:28.042 --> 29:29.491
the only things I've
got is the maid room.

29:29.491 --> 29:31.010
- What?
- The maid room?

29:31.010 --> 29:32.356
- Well, don't get excited.
I'll remove the maid out.

29:32.356 --> 29:33.979
- Yes, I should think so.

29:33.979 --> 29:34.807
- What?

29:34.807 --> 29:36.015
- Caldicott and Charters

29:36.015 --> 29:37.914
in "The Lady Vanishes"
are not interested

29:37.914 --> 29:39.467
in any women in the picture.

29:42.159 --> 29:43.643
[mischievous music]

29:43.643 --> 29:45.093
[paper rustling]

29:45.093 --> 29:47.233
What's really important about
Caldicott and Charters is

29:47.233 --> 29:50.789
that they're not the villains,
they're just in the story.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.238
- Lock the door.

29:52.238 --> 29:54.378
- Hello?
- Oh!

29:54.378 --> 29:56.725
- [Bryan] Another example
is the character of Isobel

29:56.725 --> 29:58.141
in "Suspicion."

29:58.141 --> 30:00.005
- I was completely fascinated
by the way your villain,

30:00.005 --> 30:01.109
- My villain?

30:01.109 --> 30:02.386
My hero, you mean.

30:02.386 --> 30:04.768
I always think of my
murderers as my heroes.

30:04.768 --> 30:06.252
- She has a lover

30:06.252 --> 30:10.222
and it's treated in a way
that's very matter of fact.

30:10.222 --> 30:11.257
- Think of it.

30:11.257 --> 30:12.741
This very minute,

30:12.741 --> 30:14.467
there are hundreds of people
who've committed murder

30:14.467 --> 30:15.917
and they're walking
about freely.

30:15.917 --> 30:19.058
- [Bryan] And let's not forget
Mrs. Bundy in "The Birds."

30:19.058 --> 30:22.303
- Ornithology happens
to be my avocation.

30:22.303 --> 30:25.099
Birds are not aggressive
creatures, miss.

30:25.099 --> 30:26.825
They bring beauty
into the world.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.929
It is mankind-

30:27.929 --> 30:30.311
- Sam? Three Southern
Fried Chicken.

30:30.311 --> 30:33.762
- Hitchcock also operates
in that brand of,

30:35.212 --> 30:37.318
homophobia might be putting
two strong a point on it,

30:37.318 --> 30:41.701
but definitely a distrust and
an unease about queerness.

30:42.875 --> 30:46.430
- Hitchcock clearly
had a a real interest

30:46.430 --> 30:51.401
in these male characters
who were outside of society.

30:52.781 --> 30:54.922
- And so, you get a
character like Uncle Charlie

30:54.922 --> 30:56.475
in "Shadow of a Doubt."

30:57.372 --> 30:58.822
- Charles is coming.

30:58.822 --> 31:00.341
- Did you say Charles?

31:00.341 --> 31:04.207
- Joseph Cotton is very
much a confirmed bachelor

31:04.207 --> 31:07.313
and is killing these women
who are wealthy widows

31:07.313 --> 31:08.728
who are living off of, you know,

31:08.728 --> 31:09.902
their husband's toil.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.870
[menacing music]

31:11.870 --> 31:15.874
And that just, for some reason,
is greatly offensive to him.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.360
And so, he sets about to
strangle a whole bunch of them.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.396
- And at night, you
sleep your untroubled,

31:21.396 --> 31:24.468
ordinary little sleep filled
with peaceful, stupid dreams.

31:24.468 --> 31:27.161
[classical music]

31:27.161 --> 31:29.266
And I brought you nightmares.

31:29.266 --> 31:31.648
- There is this
notion that gay men,

31:31.648 --> 31:33.650
not only don't want to
have sex with women,

31:33.650 --> 31:35.894
but hate them and
want to kill them,

31:35.894 --> 31:38.586
this notion that
radical misogyny

31:38.586 --> 31:41.934
and homosexuality go hand
in glove, as it were.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.660
- And he has that
wonderful speech

31:43.660 --> 31:45.386
when they're at
the dinner table.

31:45.386 --> 31:47.906
- The cities are full of
women, middle aged widows,

31:47.906 --> 31:51.254
husbands dead, proud of their
jewelry but of nothing else.

31:52.462 --> 31:56.638
Horrible, faded,
fat, greedy women.

31:56.638 --> 31:58.917
- And we hear Theresa
right off screen saying,

31:58.917 --> 32:00.573
"But they're human beings."

32:00.573 --> 32:02.368
- [Theresa] They're alive,
they're human beings.

32:02.368 --> 32:04.198
- [Don] And then
turning to the camera,

32:04.198 --> 32:05.682
- Are they?

32:05.682 --> 32:09.928
- It's not just that these guys
are somehow warped outsiders

32:11.377 --> 32:15.968
of society, they are literal
menaces to the common good.

32:16.865 --> 32:18.039
- [Theresa] Somebody come quick.

32:18.039 --> 32:18.902
Help.

32:20.179 --> 32:22.078
Somebody come quick,
bring some water.

32:23.527 --> 32:25.874
- He got away with putting
these kind of characters in

32:25.874 --> 32:28.808
in a time that you didn't
see gay characters.

32:28.808 --> 32:30.258
- [Phillip] I've heard
nothing but innuendo.

32:30.258 --> 32:32.088
- Call it my woman's
intuition, if you will.

32:32.088 --> 32:34.124
- I think you're jealous.

32:34.124 --> 32:35.954
No, I mean it, and
I'm very touched.

32:35.954 --> 32:36.816
- Hm?

32:39.612 --> 32:40.441
- Leonard?

32:41.856 --> 32:43.099
[gunshot blasting]

32:43.099 --> 32:45.998
- But the gay characters
weren't exactly heroes.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.380
They are mostly villains.

32:52.280 --> 32:56.595
[punch thudding]
[dramatic music]

32:56.595 --> 32:59.011
[man screaming]

32:59.011 --> 33:01.772
[tense music]

33:01.772 --> 33:04.741
- "The Rope" is one of my
favorite Hitchcock movies.

33:04.741 --> 33:07.951
I find that movie interesting,

33:07.951 --> 33:12.300
primarily because of its
screaming gay subtext

33:12.300 --> 33:14.061
that's barely subtext.

33:14.061 --> 33:16.891
I think it's almost text.

33:16.891 --> 33:18.755
- Brandon, how did you feel?

33:18.755 --> 33:19.859
- When?

33:19.859 --> 33:20.688
- During it.

33:20.688 --> 33:22.724
- "Rope," okay,

33:22.724 --> 33:26.245
if you have ever had a
gay threesome and died,

33:27.108 --> 33:28.006
this is the movie for you.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.111
- Now the fun begins.

33:31.526 --> 33:33.563
- It was pretty revolutionary.

33:33.563 --> 33:37.153
It would just be impossible
to not see the gay subtext

33:37.153 --> 33:40.535
if you yourself were a gay
person living at that time,

33:40.535 --> 33:42.054
walking to a movie
theater to see that movie.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.436
It would be
impossible to miss it.

33:44.436 --> 33:46.541
And yet, at the same
time, it's going over,

33:46.541 --> 33:48.750
you know, a lot of
the audience's head's.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.856
- "Rope" is Hitchcock's take

33:50.856 --> 33:52.754
on the Leopold and Loeb killings

33:52.754 --> 33:57.345
and the idea that this gay
couple read too much Nietzsche

33:57.345 --> 33:59.140
and decided they
were ubermensches

33:59.140 --> 34:02.005
and they were just gonna kill
people because they could.

34:02.005 --> 34:05.319
- The Davids of this
world merely occupy space,

34:06.492 --> 34:08.494
which is why he was
the perfect victim

34:08.494 --> 34:10.048
for the perfect murder.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.394
- "Rope" felt like

34:13.499 --> 34:18.194
almost more explicitly
demonizing these gay characters.

34:18.194 --> 34:21.749
- John Dall and Farley Granger,

34:21.749 --> 34:26.167
they are clearly a
gay couple engaged

34:26.167 --> 34:28.652
in a sadomasochistic
relationship.

34:28.652 --> 34:31.828
- I don't think you
appreciate me, Phillip.

34:31.828 --> 34:33.278
- I'm beginning to, Brandon.

34:33.278 --> 34:36.039
- These men have a body in
the middle of their apartment,

34:36.039 --> 34:37.972
in their table during a party.

34:37.972 --> 34:40.216
- Trust you to find a
new use for a chest.

34:40.216 --> 34:41.734
- I hate that movie,
I love that movie,

34:41.734 --> 34:44.012
but I hate that movie because
it makes me so anxious.

34:44.012 --> 34:45.221
It's "The Telltale Heart."

34:45.221 --> 34:46.429
It's the beating of
that hideous heart

34:46.429 --> 34:47.533
underneath the floorboards.

34:47.533 --> 34:50.053
[tense music]

34:53.401 --> 34:54.954
- These two men have
committed a murder,

34:54.954 --> 34:57.336
but it's all set up
like they've had sex.

34:58.544 --> 35:00.098
- Let's stay this
way for a minute.

35:05.482 --> 35:07.450
[case clicking]

35:07.450 --> 35:10.660
- That's Hitchcock
doing what he did,

35:10.660 --> 35:12.696
which is he's winking
at the audience.

35:16.424 --> 35:18.909
- I have never in my life
looked at another man

35:18.909 --> 35:21.153
in the longing way that those
two men look at each other

35:21.153 --> 35:22.775
throughout the whole film.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.502
- You frighten me.

35:25.502 --> 35:26.986
You always have,

35:26.986 --> 35:29.575
from that very first
day in prep school,

35:29.575 --> 35:33.338
part of your charm,
I suppose. [sighs]

35:35.133 --> 35:40.138
- Farley Granger is so like
simultaneously terrified

35:41.173 --> 35:43.796
yet turned on,

35:43.796 --> 35:47.455
and he's completely
under John Dall's thumb.

35:47.455 --> 35:48.456
- Man, I can't!

35:48.456 --> 35:49.285
- You've got to.

35:49.285 --> 35:50.286
- No, he knows,

35:50.286 --> 35:51.563
- Shut up.

35:51.563 --> 35:53.185
- You have a top and
a bottom. You know?

35:53.185 --> 35:56.050
You, the one who's really
driving the train on this one

35:56.050 --> 35:58.017
and the other one who's
like constantly skittish

35:58.017 --> 35:59.467
and nervous, and are
we gonna get caught?

35:59.467 --> 36:00.572
- Brandon, you're going too far.

36:00.572 --> 36:02.919
- Why? What do you mean?

36:02.919 --> 36:07.544
I just thought it'd be nice to
have supper in here on this.

36:10.237 --> 36:12.031
- The queer writers that
Hitchcock worked with

36:12.031 --> 36:13.516
on some of these films

36:13.516 --> 36:15.587
included Thornton Wilder
from "Shadow of a Doubt,"

36:15.587 --> 36:18.106
Patricia Highsmith who wrote
"Strangers on a Train,"

36:18.106 --> 36:20.005
Daphne du Maurier who
wrote "Jamaica Inn,"

36:20.005 --> 36:21.765
"Rebecca," and "The Birds,"

36:21.765 --> 36:24.182
and Arthur Laurents from "Rope."

36:24.182 --> 36:25.390
- Arthur Laurents was one

36:25.390 --> 36:27.357
of those openly gay
Hollywood writers.

36:27.357 --> 36:29.704
Laurents was in a relationship
with Farley Granger

36:29.704 --> 36:32.293
who was a wonderful actor
and a fascinating guy

36:32.293 --> 36:34.192
who lost his virginity
on the same day

36:34.192 --> 36:36.504
to a man and to a woman.

36:36.504 --> 36:38.403
Arthur Laurents
writes the screenplay.

36:38.403 --> 36:41.647
So, he's writing the
part for his lover

36:41.647 --> 36:44.754
to portray this queer man.

36:44.754 --> 36:47.205
- Brandon had a
delightful evening.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.689
Though I had a rotten evening.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.796
- Keep drinking and you'll
have a worse morning.

36:52.796 --> 36:56.766
- Arthur Laurents being an
openly gay screenwriter,

36:56.766 --> 36:59.424
the intricacies of
the relationships

36:59.424 --> 37:00.977
between the three
main characters would

37:00.977 --> 37:02.496
obviously not be lost on him.

37:02.496 --> 37:03.428
- Voice down.

37:03.428 --> 37:06.672
- I hope I didn't upset Phillip.

37:06.672 --> 37:08.709
- But that area was
all about the coding

37:08.709 --> 37:09.882
of the relationships.

37:09.882 --> 37:11.746
It wasn't about
making them explicit.

37:11.746 --> 37:14.266
It was about making
them implicit,

37:14.266 --> 37:16.199
and it was through their actions

37:16.199 --> 37:18.512
that their desires are known,

37:18.512 --> 37:20.755
not necessarily, apparently,
to Jimmy Stewart,

37:20.755 --> 37:23.102
who I don't think he
knew he was playing gay.

37:23.102 --> 37:24.897
Everyone else did
though. [laughs]

37:24.897 --> 37:26.865
- I once thought of
inviting him to join us.

37:26.865 --> 37:28.349
- Why didn't you?
The more the merrier.

37:28.349 --> 37:29.695
- Because he hasn't the nerve.

37:29.695 --> 37:33.699
- Jimmy Stewart,
as the [squeaking]

37:33.699 --> 37:38.048
also possibly queer coded
professor who's a bit of a,

37:38.048 --> 37:40.361
you know, he's kind of a bitch.

37:40.361 --> 37:41.604
- In another moment,

37:41.604 --> 37:42.846
you might have been
strangling each other

37:42.846 --> 37:44.331
instead of the chicken.

37:44.331 --> 37:46.885
- There's no lady on his
arm. I'm just saying.

37:46.885 --> 37:48.300
- He's got it.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.336
He's got it!

37:49.336 --> 37:50.889
He knows.

37:50.889 --> 37:52.062
He knows. He knows.

37:52.062 --> 37:52.856
- All right. Easy.
- He knows.

37:52.856 --> 37:53.754
- I'll take care of it.

37:53.754 --> 37:54.582
- No you won't.

37:55.687 --> 37:58.034
I'd just as soon
kill you as kill him.

37:58.034 --> 38:01.037
- One way to read "Rope"
is overtly homophobic.

38:01.037 --> 38:04.005
Another way to read it is
that it's not homosexuality

38:04.005 --> 38:08.216
but a homophobic society that's
turning men into monsters.

38:08.216 --> 38:09.563
[metal clattering]
- No.

38:09.563 --> 38:11.289
- I'm thinking the guy
in the trunk is gay too,

38:11.289 --> 38:13.118
but you know, we don't know.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.466
- [Announcer] It's
history, bizarre.

38:16.466 --> 38:18.641
It's amazing.
- Stick 'em up.

38:18.641 --> 38:19.573
Bang. Bang.

38:21.816 --> 38:23.301
[balloon popping]
[mischievous music]

38:23.301 --> 38:26.269
- When I think of Hitchcock's
representation of queerness,

38:26.269 --> 38:27.822
I think of "Strangers
on a Train."

38:27.822 --> 38:29.168
- Guy?

38:29.168 --> 38:31.757
[creepy music]

38:35.796 --> 38:36.624
Guy?

38:39.317 --> 38:40.801
Over here, Guy.

38:40.801 --> 38:43.666
- Hitchcock worked with
women like Daphne du Maurier

38:43.666 --> 38:44.943
and Patricia Highsmith

38:44.943 --> 38:47.808
who were both gay as
a box of bird seed.

38:47.808 --> 38:51.363
- Want to hear one of my
ideas for a perfect murder?

38:51.363 --> 38:54.332
- What's interesting
about Patricia Highsmith

38:54.332 --> 38:56.748
and her penchant for writing

38:56.748 --> 39:01.235
about villainous and violent
and homicidal homosexuals,

39:01.235 --> 39:02.581
in the most famous works,

39:02.581 --> 39:04.618
which would be "The
Talented Mr. Ripley,"

39:04.618 --> 39:06.999
as well as "Strangers
on a Train,"

39:06.999 --> 39:10.796
these men are desperate
to take the identity

39:10.796 --> 39:13.178
of the object of their desire.

39:13.178 --> 39:15.353
- It must be pretty
exciting to be so important.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.044
- A tennis player
isn't so important.

39:17.044 --> 39:19.943
- Oh, but people who do
things are important.

39:19.943 --> 39:22.532
Now, me, I never
seem to do anything.

39:22.532 --> 39:27.192
- It's about wanting to
completely possess someone.

39:27.192 --> 39:29.953
- Two fellows meet
accidentally, like you and me,

39:31.058 --> 39:32.024
no connection
between them at all.

39:32.024 --> 39:33.957
Never saw each other before.

39:33.957 --> 39:37.029
Each one has somebody that
he'd like to get rid of.

39:38.099 --> 39:40.205
- If you're a
Republican politician,

39:40.205 --> 39:42.310
you know what's gay about
"Strangers on a Train."

39:42.310 --> 39:43.242
[mischievous music]

39:43.242 --> 39:45.693
There is tapping. There's looks.

39:45.693 --> 39:48.351
It's, again, not explicit,

39:48.351 --> 39:50.595
but they both know what
they're talking about.

39:50.595 --> 39:53.114
- Oh, we do talk the
same language, don't we?

39:53.114 --> 39:55.323
- Well sure, Bruno. We
talk the same language.

39:55.323 --> 39:57.015
- I think, if you think
about Patricia Highsmith,

39:57.015 --> 39:59.500
it's like these
thrillers that she wrote,

39:59.500 --> 40:01.502
you know, thinking about
these queer characters

40:01.502 --> 40:04.574
as these sort of like
very depraved figures,

40:04.574 --> 40:07.681
like makes sense when
you think about her own,

40:07.681 --> 40:09.337
like her own sort
of self hatred.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.789
- Oh.
- Is your name Miriam?

40:12.789 --> 40:14.032
- Why, yes.

40:14.032 --> 40:15.482
What are you,

40:15.482 --> 40:19.037
- She was a lesbian who
did not wanna be a lesbian.

40:19.037 --> 40:21.315
She was like a homophobic,
self-hating lesbian,

40:21.315 --> 40:22.834
and she would try
to have sex with men

40:22.834 --> 40:25.423
and then be like, [groans]
sex with men is terrible.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.183
[upbeat carnival music]

40:27.183 --> 40:29.254
- When it comes to
queer characters,

40:29.254 --> 40:31.705
I wanna say he's a product
of his age, you know?

40:31.705 --> 40:34.535
There's so much Freud
floating around.

40:34.535 --> 40:38.436
There's so many overbearing
mommies, you know,

40:38.436 --> 40:39.851
who have turned their sons

40:39.851 --> 40:44.787
into these kind of like
whipped queer dogs.

40:44.787 --> 40:46.789
- Now, you haven't been
doing anything foolish.

40:46.789 --> 40:49.447
- [Don] Whether it is Bruno
in "Strangers on a Train"

40:49.447 --> 40:50.689
or Norman Bates,

40:50.689 --> 40:53.105
they are mama's boys
who are not just queer

40:53.105 --> 40:55.176
but also homicidal to boot.

40:55.176 --> 40:58.801
[dramatic music]
[flames crackling]

40:58.801 --> 41:01.459
[bomb exploding]

41:03.046 --> 41:04.565
- As a queer filmmaker

41:04.565 --> 41:07.637
who was in the closet
for a very long time

41:07.637 --> 41:10.813
and struggled with
naming my own identity,

41:10.813 --> 41:14.817
I always related with
Daphne du Maurier's work.

41:14.817 --> 41:16.991
- I have never known
birds of different species

41:16.991 --> 41:18.130
to flock together.

41:18.130 --> 41:20.754
The very concept
is unimaginable.

41:20.754 --> 41:23.964
Why? If that happened, we
wouldn't have a chance.

41:23.964 --> 41:26.518
[steady music]

41:30.039 --> 41:31.937
- Daphne du Maurier, she often,

41:31.937 --> 41:33.387
when speaking about
her own gender,

41:33.387 --> 41:36.148
talked about feeling
like deep down inside

41:36.148 --> 41:39.876
in this box was her true
gender and that it was a boy

41:39.876 --> 41:42.189
and that it wasn't something
that she could always be,

41:42.189 --> 41:43.708
but it was something
that was always there.

41:43.708 --> 41:44.502
- Who are you?

41:45.917 --> 41:47.435
What are you?

41:47.435 --> 41:49.472
- Whether we're talking
about Melanie in "The Birds"

41:49.472 --> 41:51.785
or the second Mrs. de
Winter in "Rebecca,"

41:51.785 --> 41:53.925
they have this idea
of who they should be

41:53.925 --> 41:55.202
or who they would like to be

41:55.202 --> 41:56.514
and it doesn't match
up with who they are.

41:56.514 --> 41:57.653
- I feel so uncomfortable.

41:57.653 --> 41:59.447
I try my best every day,

41:59.447 --> 42:02.692
but it's very difficult with
people looking me up and down

42:02.692 --> 42:04.556
as if I were a prize cow.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.489
- Something I
really identify with

42:06.489 --> 42:09.527
in Daphne du Maurier's work,
on a very personal level,

42:09.527 --> 42:14.532
I can understand this deep
pain behind hiding who you are.

42:16.430 --> 42:18.156
And yet, at the same time,

42:18.156 --> 42:21.504
you're essentially telling
everybody very clearly

42:21.504 --> 42:25.059
the type of prison that you
feel like you found yourself in.

42:25.059 --> 42:26.267
- This is Mrs. Danvers.

42:27.372 --> 42:29.685
- How do you do?

42:29.685 --> 42:31.203
- How do you do?

42:31.203 --> 42:34.379
- You know, you have this like
legendary bitch, "Rebecca."

42:34.379 --> 42:36.277
Her absence was a blessing

42:36.277 --> 42:38.728
to everyone except Mrs. Danvers

42:38.728 --> 42:41.559
who was completely and
utterly obsessed with her.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.353
- Did you ever see
anything so delicate?

42:43.353 --> 42:46.425
- She's without a
doubt a big old dyke.

42:46.425 --> 42:48.738
She is so in love with Rebecca.

42:48.738 --> 42:52.500
It's so obvious, and it
becomes really obvious

42:52.500 --> 42:53.743
in the panty scene.

42:53.743 --> 42:55.400
- She's gonna show
you how sheer it is.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.091
She's gonna be like, "Look."

42:57.091 --> 42:58.714
- You can see my hand.

42:58.714 --> 43:01.371
- I'm just gonna let you know
that I could see everything.

43:01.371 --> 43:02.614
And not only that,

43:02.614 --> 43:04.064
I'm gonna make it just
like a tiny bit hotter

43:04.064 --> 43:07.757
and let you know that
nuns made these drawers.

43:07.757 --> 43:09.656
[dramatic music]

43:09.656 --> 43:12.141
- It's a lovely room, isn't it?

43:12.141 --> 43:14.419
Loveliest room you've ever seen.

43:14.419 --> 43:16.628
Everything is kept just as
Mrs. de Winter liked it.

43:16.628 --> 43:18.837
- Mrs. Danvers in "Rebecca" is

43:18.837 --> 43:21.702
like the ultimate
service bottom.

43:21.702 --> 43:24.912
- I really do think that
she was a service top.

43:24.912 --> 43:27.674
- Mrs. Danvers was
definitely a service bottom,

43:27.674 --> 43:28.536
in my opinion.

43:28.536 --> 43:31.954
- Mrs. Danvers is a top.

43:31.954 --> 43:33.611
- A service bottom.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.784
Don't you think?

43:34.784 --> 43:37.235
- I think Mrs. Danvers
is a service top.

43:37.235 --> 43:38.926
- Because she liked
to be in the shadows.

43:38.926 --> 43:41.964
She liked to be like
around the blinds.

43:41.964 --> 43:43.759
- I mean, I don't even know
why there's a discussion

43:43.759 --> 43:45.036
on this point.

43:45.036 --> 43:48.349
- It is very much DS,
dominant, submissive,

43:48.349 --> 43:49.592
- Total top.

43:49.592 --> 43:52.181
She might be a servant,
but that was a, that,

43:52.181 --> 43:53.665
oh my God.

43:53.665 --> 43:54.942
- But again, it depends how
you define top and bottom,

43:54.942 --> 43:56.495
doesn't it?

43:56.495 --> 43:57.945
So, that's a trick question.

43:57.945 --> 43:59.429
[steady music]

43:59.429 --> 44:00.672
- You know what I think?

44:00.672 --> 44:04.469
We're all in our private
traps, clamped in them,

44:05.643 --> 44:07.541
and none of us can ever get out.

44:07.541 --> 44:11.994
We scratch and and claw
but only at the air,

44:11.994 --> 44:15.100
only at each other,
and for all of it,

44:16.170 --> 44:17.344
we never budge an inch.

44:17.344 --> 44:19.829
[scary music]

44:22.245 --> 44:23.350
I was born in mine.

44:23.350 --> 44:28.217
[tense music]
[raindrops splattering]

44:29.667 --> 44:31.669
- If you were to look at the
sort of killer cross dresser

44:31.669 --> 44:34.292
or the murderous man
in a dress type trope,

44:34.292 --> 44:36.052
Hitchcock was not the
first one to do it.

44:36.052 --> 44:39.228
But "Psycho" is certainly like
the best known example of it.

44:40.885 --> 44:44.716
- There are a lot of movies
about men who dress up as women

44:44.716 --> 44:46.407
and use that as a
way to gain entry

44:46.407 --> 44:49.548
to spaces that women
are traditionally in.

44:49.548 --> 44:51.171
Famously, you have Norman Bates

44:51.171 --> 44:53.449
in Marion Crane's
bathroom in "Psycho,"

44:53.449 --> 44:57.073
which is kind of the original
trans bathroom panic.

44:57.073 --> 44:59.144
[shower rod squeaking]
[scary music]

44:59.144 --> 45:01.215
[Marion screaming]
- Hitchcock captured

45:01.215 --> 45:04.702
the essence of female as victim.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.635
[creepy music]
[Marion screaming]

45:07.635 --> 45:11.709
He was able to raise that
ideal to such a height.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.126
[creepy music]

45:15.126 --> 45:17.093
I mean half the country
stopped showering.

45:17.093 --> 45:18.681
[show curtain rings clicking]

45:18.681 --> 45:19.924
[body thudding]

45:19.924 --> 45:21.719
- One of the scariest
things about "Psycho,"

45:21.719 --> 45:23.617
before we get to
the shower scene,

45:23.617 --> 45:26.689
is Marion Crane's
moral ambiguity.

45:26.689 --> 45:29.450
This is something that
is so truly upsetting

45:29.450 --> 45:31.383
at the time in 1960,

45:31.383 --> 45:35.905
that he very overtly
begins the film with her

45:35.905 --> 45:37.976
in her black brassiere.

45:37.976 --> 45:41.462
He is laying bare the
fact that this is a woman

45:41.462 --> 45:44.880
who is essentially, quote,
"Asking for trouble."

45:46.709 --> 45:47.917
- What are you
running away from?

45:47.917 --> 45:50.471
- [Osgood] The parlor
scene, it's so magnetic.

45:50.471 --> 45:54.268
It's like one of the
more magnetic scenes
in movie history.

45:54.268 --> 45:57.133
- Wouldn't it be better
if you put her someplace?

46:03.381 --> 46:05.176
- You mean an institution?

46:05.176 --> 46:09.318
- She's leaning in physically
to the conversation,

46:09.318 --> 46:11.216
kind of trying to
figure this guy out.

46:11.216 --> 46:12.873
And I think, it feels
like what she's trying

46:12.873 --> 46:14.116
to figure out is,

46:14.116 --> 46:14.806
why is this guy not
trying to fuck me?

46:14.806 --> 46:15.980
[creepy music]

46:15.980 --> 46:17.567
- We all go a little
mad sometimes.

46:20.985 --> 46:21.813
Haven't you?

46:22.780 --> 46:25.196
- When you watch
Hitchcock films,

46:25.196 --> 46:27.336
sexuality is something

46:27.336 --> 46:30.788
that comes up for the lead
characters almost always.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.238
Like sometimes, it's a
little bit more subtextual,

46:33.238 --> 46:34.722
but with something
like "Psycho,"

46:34.722 --> 46:38.761
it feels like he is really
inviting the audience

46:38.761 --> 46:43.766
to look at a particular
part of life, i.e. sex,

46:45.181 --> 46:49.530
and how that's connected to
morals, ethics, identity,

46:50.669 --> 46:52.050
anything else that
you hold dear.

46:52.050 --> 46:54.812
[tense music]

46:54.812 --> 46:57.780
- Hitchcock's legacy and
filmography are complicated.

46:57.780 --> 47:00.818
He's had some really
interesting women characters,

47:00.818 --> 47:04.407
but he also famously said that
we should torture the women

47:04.407 --> 47:06.340
to create good entertainment.

47:06.340 --> 47:09.205
[rain splattering]

47:09.205 --> 47:12.105
- It makes sense that
some of the characters

47:12.105 --> 47:13.382
that we villainize

47:13.382 --> 47:16.937
in horror movies are the
products of suppression.

47:18.387 --> 47:21.942
If you are treated as a
pathology, as a sickness,

47:21.942 --> 47:23.841
then sickness is
what you become.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.464
[tense music]

47:26.464 --> 47:28.535
- [Michael] When I
see Anthony Perkins

47:28.535 --> 47:30.537
in a movie like "Psycho,"

47:30.537 --> 47:32.435
- I've caused you some trouble.

47:32.435 --> 47:33.264
- No.

47:34.265 --> 47:36.508
Mother, my mother,

47:37.509 --> 47:38.407
what is a phrase?

47:40.236 --> 47:42.929
She isn't quite herself today.

47:42.929 --> 47:47.726
- The character
of Norman Bates is

47:47.726 --> 47:49.936
a queer man playing a queer man.

47:49.936 --> 47:51.627
- [Norman] Please, mother.

47:51.627 --> 47:54.906
- [Mother] No, I will not
hide in the fruit cellar.

47:54.906 --> 47:56.597
You think I'm fruity, huh?

47:56.597 --> 47:58.737
- There's a different
kind of connection

47:58.737 --> 48:00.774
between a mother and her gay son

48:00.774 --> 48:03.570
and you really see
Hitchcock kind of exploiting

48:03.570 --> 48:04.812
that in "Psycho"

48:05.986 --> 48:07.746
without really having to
say much else about him.

48:07.746 --> 48:10.922
We all kind of pick up
on, "Oh, that's why."

48:12.130 --> 48:14.892
- Well, a a boy's best
friend is his mother.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.549
- That was, in
Hitchcock's design,

48:17.549 --> 48:20.587
essential that Norman be my dad.

48:20.587 --> 48:23.176
[bright music]

48:32.392 --> 48:33.427

♪ I've got a date with the

48:40.193 --> 48:42.574
- It was very
comfortable for my father

48:42.574 --> 48:46.509
to be an All
American straight kid

48:46.509 --> 48:49.305
who could headline movies
in, and movie musicals.

48:49.305 --> 48:50.237
That was easy.

48:50.237 --> 48:52.377
- I don't want to die.

48:52.377 --> 48:55.001
I don't know if I could
kill anyone if I tried.

48:55.001 --> 48:57.658
- He was a young,
teenage heart throb.

48:57.658 --> 48:59.453
He was always kind
of a little off

48:59.453 --> 49:01.697
and that was what made
people interested, I think.

49:01.697 --> 49:03.941
- And you're killing me. You've
been killing me for years.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.563
Yes, you have,
and it's too much.

49:05.563 --> 49:08.704
- He went to acting as a way
to be anything but himself.

49:08.704 --> 49:11.120
- You are like all the
beautiful things in this wood.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.984
- He was tender and warm

49:12.984 --> 49:14.434
and everybody wanted
to take him home.

49:14.434 --> 49:15.953
And then he did "Psycho."

49:17.333 --> 49:19.715
Norman Bates changed Anthony
Perkins' life forever.

49:19.715 --> 49:21.751
- Gee, I'm sorry I didn't
hear you in all this rain.

49:21.751 --> 49:25.514
- "Psycho" appears, and
it's like there's no mask.

49:25.514 --> 49:28.896
You're playing your
own internal stuff.

49:28.896 --> 49:30.346
There's no remove.

49:30.346 --> 49:31.830
- Did she arrive with anyone?

49:32.762 --> 49:33.971
- No.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.076
- Did you spend
the night with her?

49:36.076 --> 49:37.284
- No.

you that character

in every twitch and in every
nervous, jittery, candy eating,

49:44.878 --> 49:46.155
you know, thing that he's doing.

49:46.155 --> 49:49.365
Hitchcock is cannily,
and maybe cruelly,

49:49.365 --> 49:51.712
finding all the
Anthony Perkins parts

49:51.712 --> 49:53.991
of Norman Bates and vice versa.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.924
That just becomes a thing
that you just don't shake.

49:58.064 --> 50:01.101
- The fact that, yet
again, in his career,

50:01.101 --> 50:06.106
Hitchcock cast a
closeted gay actor

50:07.245 --> 50:09.937
to play the monster male
figure in his movie,

50:09.937 --> 50:11.284
I think is telling.

50:11.284 --> 50:13.838
It was clearly a
pattern in his career.

50:13.838 --> 50:15.633
[water bubbling]

50:18.325 --> 50:22.916
that was sort of a motivator
in hiring him for the part.

50:22.916 --> 50:26.023
Hitchcock was too
much of a trickster

50:26.023 --> 50:31.028
and a little imp to not want
to add that really vital edge.

50:33.064 --> 50:34.307
- Wife's taking a nap,

50:34.307 --> 50:36.240
and I never can keep
quiet enough for her,

50:36.240 --> 50:39.070
so, I just thought I'd
look you up and talk.

50:39.070 --> 50:41.452
- The John Gavin scenes,
for me, with my dad are,

50:41.452 --> 50:45.490
it's like my dad against
his old, discarded itself.

50:45.490 --> 50:46.733
- You look frightened.

50:46.733 --> 50:48.045
Have I been saying
something frightening?

50:48.045 --> 50:49.563
- I don't know what
you've been saying.

50:49.563 --> 50:51.427
- Hitchcock was
probably impish enough

50:51.427 --> 50:53.740
to kind of really lean into that

50:53.740 --> 50:56.950
and hire Gavin to
mop the floor with.

50:56.950 --> 50:59.056
Norman couldn't
possibly stop him.

50:59.056 --> 51:01.230
[menacing music]

51:01.230 --> 51:04.544
And of course, he's wrong.

51:06.304 --> 51:10.584
- He imbues Norman Bates
with colors and flavors

51:10.584 --> 51:13.277
that are above and beyond
what's there on the page,

51:13.277 --> 51:14.830
that I as a gay man who,

51:14.830 --> 51:16.625
you know, spent some, at least,

51:16.625 --> 51:18.696
thankfully not my whole
life, but you know,

51:18.696 --> 51:21.078
some of my adolescence
certainly in the closet,

51:22.217 --> 51:23.735
can really relate to.

51:23.735 --> 51:25.530
I was a mama's
boy too. You know?

51:26.738 --> 51:28.775
- Sometimes, when she
talks to me like that,

51:29.983 --> 51:32.779
I feel I'd like to go
up there and curse her

51:32.779 --> 51:36.231
and leave her forever
or at least a fire.

51:41.443 --> 51:43.134
But I know I can't.

51:43.134 --> 51:45.723
- Anthony Perkins is
really channeling the pain

51:45.723 --> 51:48.105
of not being able to
express his queerness.

51:48.105 --> 51:50.210
And that's why we remember it

51:50.210 --> 51:52.281
as such a powerhouse performance

51:52.281 --> 51:54.939
because it really is
somebody's real lived pain.

51:54.939 --> 51:56.975
- So, the narrative,
in my house,

51:56.975 --> 51:59.633
was "Psycho" had been
too right for my dad

51:59.633 --> 52:03.292
and therefore, was the end
of him as an actor, really.

52:03.292 --> 52:05.915
It was like his coming out and
his funeral at the same time.

52:05.915 --> 52:07.848
In one swift move, the whole,

52:07.848 --> 52:11.093
the whole jig was up.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.992
"Psycho" was no good for him.

52:13.992 --> 52:15.235
It was too good,

52:15.235 --> 52:17.686
it was too good, and
therefore, no good.

52:17.686 --> 52:19.170
It had damaged my
father's career

52:19.170 --> 52:23.347
because now no one could
see him as anything else.

52:23.347 --> 52:26.971
There was no freedom in 1960
to say, "Oh, and by the way,

52:26.971 --> 52:29.180
the reason why I'm so
great in this role,

52:29.180 --> 52:30.906
I'm just like that."

52:32.183 --> 52:34.358
If my father had made "Psycho"

52:34.358 --> 52:38.051
and then somehow miraculously
had been allowed to come out

52:38.051 --> 52:40.778
and had said,
"Look, you fuckers,

52:40.778 --> 52:44.195
out there in the audience
who ate that up."

52:44.195 --> 52:45.714
I mean, you eat it up,

52:45.714 --> 52:47.681
and what you're eating
up is truth, right?

52:47.681 --> 52:49.959
You ate up Tony Perkins's truth

52:49.959 --> 52:51.927
and he's got a lot more of that.

52:51.927 --> 52:52.928
Like, he's got a lot of that.

52:52.928 --> 52:54.481
He's a human being. You know?

52:54.481 --> 52:59.452
That could have been mined in
a way that just couldn't be.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.419
Do you know?

53:01.419 --> 53:02.351
There just, there,
it just wasn't,

53:02.351 --> 53:03.525
there wasn't an outlet for that.

53:03.525 --> 53:05.768
[menacing music]

53:05.768 --> 53:10.773
[chains jingling]
[scary music]

53:15.502 --> 53:18.264
- It was perhaps inevitable
that, at some point,

53:18.264 --> 53:21.025
he would step back into
the role for "Psycho II."

53:21.025 --> 53:23.890
- [Narrator] It's
22 years later,

53:23.890 --> 53:26.996
and Norman Bates is coming home.

53:26.996 --> 53:31.346
Psycho II.
[scary music]

53:31.346 --> 53:33.348
- It felt good to see him going

53:33.348 --> 53:35.488
into a packed,
huge movie theater.

53:35.488 --> 53:37.041
We toured the world,

53:37.041 --> 53:38.284
and he would get up there
and talk before the movie,

53:38.284 --> 53:41.148
and people were going nuts.

53:41.148 --> 53:43.910
And so, it's like your dad's
Paul McCartney for 10 minutes.

53:43.910 --> 53:46.637
- I just moved back here
after being many years away,

53:46.637 --> 53:50.227
and I forgot to
bring any cutlery.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.090
- And it was like, this is good.

53:52.090 --> 53:54.610
This seems good. This seems
like this is all working.

53:54.610 --> 53:57.095
[woman screaming]

53:57.095 --> 54:00.237
[creepy music]

54:00.237 --> 54:02.342
And then there was the
"People" magazine cover,

54:02.342 --> 54:04.586
[thunder rumbling]

54:04.586 --> 54:06.691
which basically said,

54:06.691 --> 54:10.247
remember Tony Perkins who's
gay and played a mama's boy,

54:10.247 --> 54:12.249
a killer who dressed
up like a woman?

54:12.249 --> 54:15.182
Remember all that?
It's happening again.

54:15.182 --> 54:17.184
That cover was,

54:17.184 --> 54:19.463
I saw that as a kid.

54:19.463 --> 54:21.810
There's no way that
I didn't get that

54:21.810 --> 54:24.502
and then be fed a very
different narrative.

54:24.502 --> 54:27.229
- We know all about
that. Don't we, Norman?

54:28.713 --> 54:33.718
- And then "Psycho III"
was sort of triply,

54:34.443 --> 54:35.410
sorry, interesting,

54:35.410 --> 54:38.482
[upbeat tense music]

54:39.655 --> 54:42.002
because he was authoring
this as the director.

54:42.002 --> 54:43.935
He was, it was
his point of view.

54:43.935 --> 54:48.388
"Psycho III" is like
this dirty movie.

54:49.803 --> 54:51.598
- [Norman] She can't help it.

54:51.598 --> 54:54.049
She can't help the
things she does.

54:54.049 --> 54:57.328
- This was the dawning of
like, "Oh my dad's like,

54:57.328 --> 54:59.468
like sex is like a
big thing for him."

54:59.468 --> 55:00.987
There's no mistake about
how my dad is looking

55:00.987 --> 55:02.540
at Jeff Fahey.

55:02.540 --> 55:05.509
If Norman Bates could make
a movie about Norman Bates

55:05.509 --> 55:06.682
as an older guy,

55:06.682 --> 55:09.306
it'd probably be
really fucking dirty,

55:09.306 --> 55:10.514
and good for him.

55:10.514 --> 55:13.240
- You did a nice
job on her, Norman,

55:13.240 --> 55:15.312
fresh as the day
she was croaked.

55:17.314 --> 55:20.317
- It was so authentic, and
all of a sudden my dad,

55:20.317 --> 55:23.389
who had been completely
inauthentic with me

55:23.389 --> 55:26.599
for so long was
all of a sudden now

55:26.599 --> 55:29.326
on a big screen being authentic.

55:29.326 --> 55:32.432
- The past? It's
never really past.

55:32.432 --> 55:34.365
It stays with me all the time,

55:34.365 --> 55:35.539
and no matter how hard I try,

55:35.539 --> 55:38.300
I can't really escape.

55:38.300 --> 55:39.853
It's always there,

55:39.853 --> 55:41.338
throbbing inside you.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.823
- I don't know, it's almost
on the nose, you know?

55:43.823 --> 55:47.827
How sad it is and how much
he was able to tap into

55:47.827 --> 55:49.449
that energy in his film roles,

55:50.347 --> 55:51.831
because he really did live it.

55:51.831 --> 55:55.041
- For many years, our
next guest was one

55:55.041 --> 55:57.354
of Hollywood's most
confirmed bachelors,

55:57.354 --> 56:00.218
but a talented young
photographer has
changed all of that.

56:00.218 --> 56:01.979
Here are Mr. and
Mrs. Tony Perkins.

56:01.979 --> 56:04.533
Tony Perkins and Berry Berenson.

56:04.533 --> 56:05.741
- Do you know, like I think

56:05.741 --> 56:07.674
my mom and dad's story
is a genuine one.

56:07.674 --> 56:09.331
They loved each other for real

56:09.331 --> 56:11.506
and they had a for real
sexual relationship.

56:11.506 --> 56:14.923
- Was he anything like you had
imagined having seen him in,

56:14.923 --> 56:16.580
on the screen and having
liked him on the screen?

56:16.580 --> 56:17.857
- Everything and more. Yeah.

56:17.857 --> 56:19.376
- Really?
- Yeah,

56:19.376 --> 56:20.791
definitely. [laughs]

56:20.791 --> 56:23.000
- That's great, let's
hear about the more,

56:23.000 --> 56:24.242
'cause we know the abstract.

56:24.242 --> 56:25.727
[group laughing]

56:25.727 --> 56:28.764
- He needed to be hidden,
and so, she was gonna help.

56:28.764 --> 56:33.597
And I don't think that, until
it became literally fatal,

56:34.977 --> 56:37.394
I think she probably
would've done it forever.

56:37.394 --> 56:41.398
- AIDS has claimed another
Hollywood star, Anthony Perkins.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.020
Perkins, who was 60 years old,

56:43.020 --> 56:45.436
did not discuss his
disease publicly.

56:45.436 --> 56:47.611
He died in his Hollywood
home this weekend

56:47.611 --> 56:49.992
with his wife and
two sons by his side.

56:49.992 --> 56:51.753
[slow music]

56:51.753 --> 56:56.758
- The story of how he
contracted HIV was made up.

56:57.621 --> 56:59.381
I mean, my parents made it up.

56:59.381 --> 57:00.900
It was a blood transfusion.

57:00.900 --> 57:02.833
He'd had a surgery
on his face to get,

57:02.833 --> 57:04.248
a little thing had been removed,

57:04.248 --> 57:06.768
and they had used
some bad blood.

57:10.703 --> 57:15.259
We were parrying reality
and choosing the lie.

57:15.259 --> 57:19.781
And it's kind of a lot to untie.

57:19.781 --> 57:21.230
I think we do it for love.

57:21.230 --> 57:24.648
If my mom was gonna be
captain of the love team

57:24.648 --> 57:28.410
and that was the route
she was charting for us,

57:28.410 --> 57:30.205
then let's do it.

57:30.205 --> 57:31.448
You know? Good.

57:31.448 --> 57:32.518
That's love.

57:32.518 --> 57:35.210
And it is love. It is.

57:35.210 --> 57:36.970
Protecting somebody is love

57:36.970 --> 57:40.905
and it just has other
things attached to it.

57:42.597 --> 57:45.772
My dad was a really good dad.

57:45.772 --> 57:48.741
He was a complete original.

57:48.741 --> 57:51.744
He introduced a
significant wrinkle

57:51.744 --> 57:54.022
into my understanding
of how the world works.

57:54.022 --> 57:58.440
And you know, that's,

57:58.440 --> 57:59.855
in a way, that's a privilege.

58:03.445 --> 58:04.446
