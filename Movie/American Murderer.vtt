So Jason vacates your property

18:04.605 --> 18:07.260

left on his lease?

18:07.303 --> 18:09.566
He must have given you
a good reason for that.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.960
Yeah, he said his
brother's wife was sick

18:12.003 --> 18:13.396
with breast cancer.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.008
And he wanted to go spend
time with his family.

enough reason for me.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.563
We're talking 200 percent
return on investments.

33:20.607 --> 33:21.869
So I started thinking,

33:21.912 --> 33:24.219
you know like,
why can't I do this

33:24.263 --> 33:25.873
for the people that I love?

33:25.916 --> 33:30.182
I started thinking,
why can't I do this for you,

33:30.225 --> 33:35.143
and mom, I know that
I have not been the best son.

33:35.187 --> 33:36.492
Right, and I messed
some things up,

33:36.536 --> 33:39.017
but I do believe that
this can change that.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.106
And I do know for a fact

33:41.149 --> 33:46.067
that if you invested
$20,000...

33:46.111 --> 33:48.069
Yeah, $20,000.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.245
I could quadruple your money.

33:50.289 --> 33:51.768
So this time next year,

33:51.812 --> 33:54.989
you and I,
we're vacationing in Cabo.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.078
Five star resort.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.994
Margaritas on the beach all day.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.605
What do you say?

34:05.217 --> 34:07.001
I was wondering
how long it had been

34:07.045 --> 34:09.395
since I'd last seen you.

34:09.438 --> 34:12.224
But then I realized
this is your first time

34:12.267 --> 34:13.268
seeing this house.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.140
You know how long ago it was

34:15.183 --> 34:16.706
that David got it for me?

34:16.750 --> 34:19.405
Well, we're gonna get you
a better one after I'm done.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.059
Three years.

34:21.102 --> 34:24.062
That's how long it's been
since you visited me.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.326
I know, and truly, I'm sorry.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.937
And then you have the audacity

34:29.980 --> 34:34.376
to walk in here and ask me
for $20,000?

34:34.420 --> 34:36.813
Twenty thousand dollars
of my money?

34:36.857 --> 34:40.556
This is a huge
opportunity, huge.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.776
For whom exactly, tell me.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.038
For both of us.

34:45.648 --> 34:48.608
Cut the shit, Jason, please.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.959
How stupid do you think I am?

34:52.002 --> 34:54.614
I know you borrowed money
from David, from Jamie.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.746
It's not true.
They invested.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.009
And then you come
here prancing around

34:59.053 --> 35:01.577
in a fucking Cadillac.

35:01.621 --> 35:02.665
I had a good year, mom.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.319
Son!

35:04.363 --> 35:05.799
I know that car isn't yours.

35:05.842 --> 35:09.890
I know there's no business,
no opportunity.

35:09.933 --> 35:13.676
So no, I won't be investing.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.027
Yep, well,

35:17.071 --> 35:20.901
mom, I think you
really might want to...

35:20.944 --> 35:22.337
rethink that one because I mean

35:22.381 --> 35:24.513
the profits we made
this year alone,

35:24.557 --> 35:26.385
do you understand how much
money that you could make?

35:26.428 --> 35:27.995
Enough!

35:28.778 --> 35:30.432
Jesus Christ!

35:30.476 --> 35:31.738
Who do you think you're fooling

35:31.781 --> 35:34.306
with all that CEO talk bullshit?

35:34.349 --> 35:35.742
I'm your mother!

35:37.135 --> 35:41.139
Is there any part
of that brain of yours

35:41.182 --> 35:43.532
that could just
tell you to stop?

35:56.241 --> 35:58.591
I'm sorry, Jason.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.810
I can't lend you any more money.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.814
I know that's why you drop by,

36:04.858 --> 36:07.208
'cause of course
that's the only reason

36:07.252 --> 36:09.384
you ever do come by,

36:09.428 --> 36:12.082
but I just can't
do it this time.

36:12.126 --> 36:15.173
I'm in trouble, mom,
I'm in big trouble.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.176
I need your help, please.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.311
You're some actor,
you know that.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.488
I'm not acting. I'm not acting.

36:26.532 --> 36:29.491
These guys,
if I don't pay them money,

36:29.535 --> 36:30.710
they're gonna kill me.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.233
Oh, God,

36:32.277 --> 36:35.410
you really are
your father's son.

36:35.454 --> 36:40.502
Sometimes I think the only
difference between you two

36:40.546 --> 36:44.332
is that you are just
delusional enough

36:44.376 --> 36:46.552
to buy your own bullshit!

36:53.428 --> 36:55.909
I'm sorry, Jason.
I shouldn't have said that.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.867
No, no, no.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.217
It's...

37:02.437 --> 37:03.656
it's all right.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.098
I should go.

37:13.056 --> 37:14.275
I should go.

37:18.671 --> 37:21.413
Do you know what gives
me great comfort?

37:21.456 --> 37:23.153
Is that a year from now

37:23.197 --> 37:25.808
I'm gonna be
sunbathing on a yacht.

37:25.852 --> 37:27.288
Sailing the Pacific

37:27.332 --> 37:29.986
with seven Victoria's
Secret supermodels.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.032
Roaming the globe
and living it up.

37:32.075 --> 37:34.774
And do you know where
you're gonna be, mom?

37:36.341 --> 37:41.084
Right fucking here, all alone.

37:41.128 --> 37:45.132
A mean, old miserable bitch.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.312
Get out, now.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.618
Get outta my house.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.185
It was a nice visit.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.624
See you again in
another four years.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.414
Goodbye, Jason.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.593
[somber music]

38:11.637 --> 38:13.334
[Jason] It's my dad's.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.379
No, my father's.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.729
This was my father's.

38:19.079 --> 38:22.082
He died peacefully.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.866
He died peacefully.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.913
He lived, he lived a good life.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.307
This,

38:30.612 --> 38:33.441
this one was my mom's.

38:33.485 --> 38:36.096
She left this for me.

38:36.139 --> 38:39.317
She left me this
recently because she, um,

38:39.360 --> 38:41.797
she recently passed away.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.233
She recently passed away.

38:43.277 --> 38:47.063
She was diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer,

38:47.107 --> 38:51.329
which was very painful for her.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.159
And it was very painful
for me, too.

38:56.203 --> 39:00.468
You know,
because we were so close.

39:00.512 --> 39:03.776
We were so close, me and
that miserable fucking bitch,

39:03.819 --> 39:05.168
yeah.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.258
I am so fucking good, bro.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.393
Real fucking tears.

39:18.268 --> 39:19.618
She's my...

39:19.661 --> 39:21.402
she's my best friend.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.231
She was my best friend.

39:26.842 --> 39:29.628
It was a nice visit, yeah.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.674
Thanks, mom.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.851
Thanks, dad.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.897
Wherever the fuck you are.

39:45.426 --> 39:48.560
[car door slamming]

40:03.444 --> 40:04.706
Hi.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.069
Here you go, Leising.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.293
[Jamie] Ten years ago,

40:26.336 --> 40:29.035
my brother was a completely
different person.

40:29.078 --> 40:32.212
He was married.
He was a Mormon, straight edge.

40:32.255 --> 40:33.561
I mean he was
a missionary in France.

40:33.605 --> 40:36.390
That, that was his whole life.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.481
Ten years ago, you said?

40:40.525 --> 40:41.569
Yeah.

40:41.613 --> 40:42.875
Isn't that right about the time

40:42.918 --> 40:45.573
that your father went missing?

40:51.100 --> 40:52.406
Jamie?

40:53.668 --> 40:55.714
Dad's probably on
a beach somewhere

40:55.757 --> 40:58.238
drinking mai tais.

40:58.281 --> 41:01.720
Probably trying to fuck a nurse
or something, you know.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.765
[David] Fuck a nurse?

41:03.809 --> 41:06.855
Yeah, dad loves nurses.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.640
Seriously, man.

41:08.683 --> 41:14.646
I remember he used to say nurses
are the most sexual women.

41:14.689 --> 41:16.691
I don't remember
him saying that.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.911
Does sound like some
shit he would say.

41:18.954 --> 41:21.566
He's gonna have stories
when he gets back.

41:21.609 --> 41:24.482
[David] J, I don't think
he's coming back, man.

41:24.525 --> 41:28.616
Well, if that's happening
then so is this.

41:33.403 --> 41:35.101
It's a little big for you, no?

41:35.144 --> 41:36.711
I get it fitted.

41:36.755 --> 41:38.321
You know, it's probably fake.

41:38.365 --> 41:41.760
Oh, you jealous bro,
that you didn't grab it first?

41:41.803 --> 41:43.413
[David] I couldn't care less,
man, let's go.

41:43.457 --> 41:47.113
[Jamie] Jason, David,
what the hell is going on?

41:47.156 --> 41:48.636
-[Jason] Hey.
-[David] Hi.

41:48.680 --> 41:49.811
Hi?

41:49.855 --> 41:51.900
What the fuck? Where is dad?

41:53.641 --> 41:54.729
Hello?

41:54.773 --> 41:56.383
What the hell are
you guys packing?

41:56.426 --> 41:58.777
I mean, obviously you've
been talking to him.

41:58.820 --> 41:59.995
Don't get involved, Jamie.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.170
Don't tell me to fuck off.

42:01.214 --> 42:03.129
Don't tell me to
not get involved.

42:03.172 --> 42:05.610
All right, the cops called me.

42:05.653 --> 42:06.654
-Yeah?
-[Jamie] Yeah.

42:06.698 --> 42:07.960
What did you tell them?

42:08.003 --> 42:09.222
I don't know, David.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.832
Nothing, 'cause I
don't know anything.

42:10.876 --> 42:13.313
So can you just please tell
me what the hell is going on?

42:13.356 --> 42:14.967
What did they tell you?

42:15.010 --> 42:16.621
I, I don't know.

42:16.664 --> 42:19.667
Oh, they found his car
abandoned in Brownsville, Texas

42:19.711 --> 42:21.103
right by the Mexican border.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.018
So explain this to me.

42:23.062 --> 42:25.020
Don't get involved.

42:25.064 --> 42:27.153
-Let's go.
-Seriously, David?

42:30.373 --> 42:32.158
Hey, hey, Jason.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.595
Can you please just tell me
what the hell is going on?

42:34.639 --> 42:36.466
Yeah, hey, don't worry about it.

42:36.510 --> 42:39.600
We're just squaring
some stuff away for him.

42:39.644 --> 42:40.993
Dad's coming back.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.259
I always tell you the truth.

42:46.302 --> 42:50.045
You know that, right?

42:50.089 --> 42:52.526
-[truck horn honking]
-[David] Let's go!

42:52.570 --> 42:54.615
So annoying.

42:54.659 --> 42:56.486
Those pants look better on me.

42:57.357 --> 42:59.054
Stop.

42:59.098 --> 43:00.403
I'll let you borrow them.

43:00.447 --> 43:02.362
[Jason] There's that smile.
Love you.

43:02.405 --> 43:03.493
Love you.

43:05.626 --> 43:08.455
[engine humming]

43:17.116 --> 43:20.032
[buttons beeping]

43:22.425 --> 43:23.775
Come on!

43:37.049 --> 43:38.137
[thuds]

43:39.399 --> 43:42.184
[engine humming]

44:21.963 --> 44:24.444
This is the Glock model 21.

44:24.487 --> 44:26.315
It's a 45 ACP.

44:26.359 --> 44:28.274
This is what your
Secret Service uses.

44:28.317 --> 44:29.884
Military personnel.

44:29.928 --> 44:32.844
A lot of police officers choose
that as a service weapon.

44:34.541 --> 44:37.675
[suspenseful music]

44:44.029 --> 44:46.074
How do I look?

44:46.118 --> 44:47.597
Deadly.

44:47.641 --> 44:48.990
Good answer.

44:57.433 --> 44:59.827
[camera clicking]

44:59.871 --> 45:01.176
You wanna shoot it?

45:01.220 --> 45:02.395
Fuck yeah.

45:02.438 --> 45:05.093
[gun firing]

45:39.519 --> 45:40.650
[officer] Kyle Wallace.

-Open up.
-[knocking on door]

45:42.391 --> 45:45.481
-Police.
-[knocking on door]

45:48.746 --> 45:50.269
Kyle!

45:51.487 --> 45:54.534
[dramatic music]

45:55.796 --> 45:58.930
[yelps]

45:58.973 --> 46:01.715
Get the fuck off me, man!
Get the fuck off.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.804
I didn't do nothing!

46:03.848 --> 46:05.327
Pieces of shit.

46:05.371 --> 46:06.894
I didn't fucking do nothing.

46:06.938 --> 46:08.809
This is bullshit.

46:08.853 --> 46:10.419
[Leising] All right,
Kyle, let's go.

46:10.463 --> 46:11.986
Tell me how you know this guy.

46:15.555 --> 46:17.992
Who that, man?

46:18.036 --> 46:20.081
He put down the address
of this apartment

46:20.125 --> 46:22.475
when he bought a Glock.

46:22.518 --> 46:24.129
Now I know you know Jason,

46:24.172 --> 46:26.653
and I know he's
been here recently.

46:29.395 --> 46:31.049
So let's try this again.

46:33.138 --> 46:34.617
How do you know this guy?

46:37.272 --> 46:39.535
All right, I met
Jason a while back.

46:40.885 --> 46:41.929
Come on.

46:41.973 --> 46:43.191
It's not like we
close or anything.

46:43.235 --> 46:46.151
He's a fun dude
to party with and shit.

46:46.194 --> 46:47.761
Anyway, he came through here

46:47.805 --> 46:49.415
completely out the blue.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.286
Word on the street,
he had gambling debt

46:51.330 --> 46:53.158
to some coldblooded
motherfuckers.

46:57.336 --> 47:01.122
[Jason] Yo, Kyle Wallace!

47:01.166 --> 47:03.037
Dude borrowed money
from everyone.

47:04.996 --> 47:06.432
Okay.

47:06.475 --> 47:07.868
[Kyle] Jason?

47:07.912 --> 47:10.131
Oh, buddy.

47:10.175 --> 47:12.568
What are you doing here?

47:12.612 --> 47:13.700
Passing through, dog.

47:13.743 --> 47:16.181
Yo, come kick it
with me for a bit.

47:16.224 --> 47:18.400
Man, I heard you were in some
deep shit, like for real.

47:18.444 --> 47:20.750
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

47:20.794 --> 47:22.100
I took care of that.

47:22.143 --> 47:23.318
Money's in the account.

47:23.362 --> 47:24.842
It's all straight, I swear.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.061
Kick with me for a bit.

47:27.105 --> 47:29.324
I got something I wanna
talk to you about.

47:29.368 --> 47:32.153
I got a little uh...

47:32.197 --> 47:35.200
A little opportunity
I wanna run by you.

47:36.070 --> 47:38.029
[loud snorting]

47:38.072 --> 47:39.378
Oh fuck.

47:39.421 --> 47:40.770
That's good shit.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.250
-[Jason] Yeah.
-It's Cali shit?

47:42.294 --> 47:44.992
[both groaning]

47:47.386 --> 47:48.648
So are you going to tell
me about this opportunity?

47:48.691 --> 47:49.867
What's good?

47:49.910 --> 47:52.043
Yeah, bro.

47:53.131 --> 47:54.436
Check it out.

47:59.311 --> 48:02.183
I'm gonna rob an armored truck,

48:02.227 --> 48:04.359
and I want you to help me.

48:04.403 --> 48:05.970
Now look, I've done
a bunch of research.

48:06.013 --> 48:07.188
Now check it out, check it out.

48:07.232 --> 48:09.451
A fucking box office
from a theater

48:09.495 --> 48:10.844
on a big fucking weekend,

48:10.888 --> 48:12.280
like a weekend after
fucking Thanksgiving

48:12.324 --> 48:16.328
can have
up to $300,000 cash.

48:16.371 --> 48:17.329
On hand, right?

48:17.372 --> 48:19.070
-Right?
-Right.

48:19.113 --> 48:20.680
-[Jason] Right?
-Right.

48:20.723 --> 48:22.508
So now the fucking armored truck
pulls up outside the theater

48:22.551 --> 48:23.639
on the Monday morning.

48:23.683 --> 48:25.815
That guard walks
with one fucking bag

48:25.859 --> 48:29.341
full of all that cash,

48:29.384 --> 48:30.951
all that fucking cash.

48:30.995 --> 48:32.735
So on his walk from
the fucking theater

48:32.779 --> 48:34.128
into the fucking truck,

48:34.172 --> 48:36.391
that motherfucker's
completely fucking vulnerable.

48:36.435 --> 48:38.959
Kyle, it's like one man

48:39.003 --> 48:40.830
against a loaded gun.

48:40.874 --> 48:42.397
You know what I'm saying?

48:42.441 --> 48:43.790
It's practically risk free.

48:43.833 --> 48:45.357
All you gotta do...

48:47.011 --> 48:48.664
is pop him first.

48:48.708 --> 48:49.970
You know?

48:52.059 --> 48:54.496
You're fucking with me, right?

48:54.540 --> 48:55.845
No.

48:55.889 --> 48:58.239
Motherfucker, you ever
popped a dude before?

49:00.067 --> 49:01.547
Have you?

49:01.590 --> 49:03.157
I haven't had to, but
I've seen dudes get shot,

49:03.201 --> 49:04.593
and let me tell
you something, bro.

49:04.637 --> 49:06.421
That shit's above
your pay grade.

49:08.902 --> 49:11.992
Yeah, yeah.

49:12.036 --> 49:15.387
Yeah, yeah.

49:15.430 --> 49:18.433
Yeah. Is that a no, mommy?

49:18.477 --> 49:19.826
Is that a no, mommy?

49:19.869 --> 49:23.003
[chuckling]

49:23.047 --> 49:24.570
But I want to, mommy.

49:24.613 --> 49:27.051
[laughing]

49:28.966 --> 49:31.577
But I want to, mommy!

49:31.620 --> 49:32.795
You fucking with me.

49:32.839 --> 49:34.232
I've seen dudes get shot!

49:34.275 --> 49:35.363
I've been in the mud!

49:35.407 --> 49:38.018
[laughing]

49:38.062 --> 49:40.281
I've seen things!

49:40.325 --> 49:43.154
You know what I'm saying?

49:43.197 --> 49:46.418
Yo, yo, yo, answer me
one fucking question

49:46.461 --> 49:48.246
right fucking now.

49:48.289 --> 49:49.943
[Kyle] What the fuck, bro?

49:49.987 --> 49:52.467
Is this shit still above
my fucking pay grade?

49:52.511 --> 49:54.121
What the fuck?

49:54.165 --> 49:56.515
I'm not fucking kidding, dawg.
Put the fucking shit down.

49:59.561 --> 50:01.563
Click, it's empty, bro.

50:02.869 --> 50:05.350
Fucking, what the fuck was that?

50:05.393 --> 50:07.874
-Ow!
-Fucking crazy!

50:07.917 --> 50:09.310
Think that shit's funny?

50:09.354 --> 50:12.705
-I'll slap your shit!
-I'm fucking with you.

50:12.748 --> 50:14.315
Get the fuck out of my house!

50:14.359 --> 50:16.535
-Yo, Kyle!
-Get the fuck out of my house!

50:16.578 --> 50:18.319
When did you turn into such
a whiny ass little bitch?

50:18.363 --> 50:20.234
-I'm joking.
-I ain't no fucking bitch!

50:20.278 --> 50:21.235
Get the fuck out of my house!

50:21.279 --> 50:23.237
I'm sorry, all right?

50:23.281 --> 50:26.023
Dude, chill, I'm kidding.

50:26.066 --> 50:27.328
Dude, fucking chill, bitch.

50:27.372 --> 50:30.070
Get your panties out
of a fucking bunch.

50:30.114 --> 50:31.637
-You're fucking out of it.
-[Jason] Oh!

50:31.680 --> 50:34.727
Whatever path you're on,
Jason... That's all you, bro.

50:34.770 --> 50:39.123
Fucking Kyle Wallace
is a fucking pussy.

50:39.166 --> 50:40.689
[Kyle] Fuck off!

50:44.084 --> 50:47.131
Kyle Wallace is fucking pussy.
[blabbering]

50:50.438 --> 50:51.570
And that's it.

50:51.613 --> 50:53.093
I ain't seen him
again after that.

50:53.137 --> 50:55.530
He called me fucking
16 times the next day,

50:55.574 --> 50:56.749
but I didn't pick up.

50:56.792 --> 50:58.142
I just avoided him.

51:00.753 --> 51:01.971
Hmm.

51:03.538 --> 51:04.931
All right, Kyle.

51:06.193 --> 51:07.368
Book him.

51:07.412 --> 51:10.241
What the fuck, man?
I didn't do shit!

51:10.284 --> 51:11.416
This is bullshit!

51:11.459 --> 51:13.287
Fucking, fuck you guys!

51:13.331 --> 51:14.593
Fucking pigs.

51:14.636 --> 51:15.985
Goddamn it.

51:19.902 --> 51:21.774
[man] Three days.

51:21.817 --> 51:23.428
You fucking understand?

51:25.256 --> 51:28.215
[Debt Collector] I need to
speak to Jason immediately,

51:28.259 --> 51:30.565
'cause he owes us
a lot of money.

51:30.609 --> 51:32.567
You hear me?

51:32.611 --> 51:34.178
[Jeanne] How stupid
do you think I am?

51:34.221 --> 51:38.269
I know you borrowed money
from David, from Jamie.

51:38.312 --> 51:40.097
[loan officer]
I'm sorry, Mr. Harline,

51:40.140 --> 51:41.272
but you're maxed out.

51:41.315 --> 51:42.577
[Jeanne]
And then you come here.

51:42.621 --> 51:46.233
Prancing around in
a fucking Cadillac.

51:46.277 --> 51:47.539
[loan officer]
You want some advice, kid?

51:47.582 --> 51:48.888
Go to the arcade.

51:48.931 --> 51:51.543
Have a good time,
for God's sake.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.371
[Debt Collector]
So you tell your brother,

51:53.414 --> 51:55.460
get on the phone or we're
gonna get the police involved

51:55.503 --> 51:57.157
and throw him in jail.

51:57.201 --> 52:00.117
[Jeanne] Is there any part
of that brain of yours

52:00.160 --> 52:03.511
that could just
tell you to stop!

52:07.559 --> 52:11.215
[slow suspenseful music]

52:37.980 --> 52:40.679
[door rattling]

53:26.638 --> 53:29.467
[engine humming]

53:35.299 --> 53:36.387
Hey, Mel.

53:38.389 --> 53:40.304
Yeah, guess who?

53:42.958 --> 53:44.830
-Hi.
-Hi.

53:44.873 --> 53:46.223
I was pretty surprised
when he called.

53:46.266 --> 53:48.834
I hadn't heard from him
in over a year, I think.

53:49.878 --> 53:50.923
[Zachary] Jason!

53:51.619 --> 53:53.273
Ah-ha!

53:53.317 --> 53:54.666
[Melanie] And he said he was
just passing through town,

53:54.709 --> 53:56.972
and he needed a place
to stay for a few nights.

53:57.973 --> 53:59.236
So what did you say?

54:00.454 --> 54:02.239
I said of course.

54:02.282 --> 54:03.805
Truth be told,

54:03.849 --> 54:06.765
he was a pretty
great house guest.

54:06.808 --> 54:08.332
He'd usually go out
in the mornings,

54:08.375 --> 54:12.031
and then stay gone
most of the day.

54:28.221 --> 54:31.050
[Jason laughing]

54:55.074 --> 54:58.686
The ball is high,
the ball is deep!

54:58.730 --> 55:00.645
It's gone!

55:00.688 --> 55:02.124
Yes!

55:07.391 --> 55:09.567
So he stayed with you
for 10 days?

55:09.610 --> 55:10.655
I guess.

55:10.698 --> 55:12.570
Didn't really feel
like that long.

55:13.832 --> 55:16.443
[soft moaning]

55:49.694 --> 55:51.609
But he didn't spend
Thanksgiving with you, right?

55:51.652 --> 55:52.697
Yeah.

55:52.740 --> 55:54.089
He left the morning of.

55:55.830 --> 55:58.224
He said he had to spend
it with his family.

56:02.184 --> 56:05.492
I really think you should
spend Thanksgiving with us.

56:05.536 --> 56:06.841
Yeah, baby, you know I want to,

56:06.885 --> 56:08.365
but I gotta spend it
with Jamie this year.

56:08.408 --> 56:10.454
Otherwise she'll kill me.

56:10.497 --> 56:12.456
Come on, you really
shouldn't be mad.

56:12.499 --> 56:13.457
I'm not.

56:13.500 --> 56:14.936
Hey, hey.

56:16.024 --> 56:18.157
You shouldn't be sad either.

56:18.200 --> 56:19.376
You wanna know why?

56:20.420 --> 56:22.204
Why, why?

56:22.248 --> 56:25.294
Because I'm moving
back here in January.

56:26.905 --> 56:27.949
No, you're not.

56:27.993 --> 56:30.038
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

56:30.082 --> 56:31.649
I'm coming back here in January.

56:31.692 --> 56:35.740
So can the two of you wait
a couple months for me?

56:35.783 --> 56:38.264
'Cause if I come back here,

56:38.307 --> 56:40.179
if I roll up back here
and there's another dude

56:40.222 --> 56:43.443
living in the street, you
know, across the street,

56:43.487 --> 56:44.966
and he come in here
and swept you off your feet,

56:45.010 --> 56:46.228
I swear to God,

56:46.272 --> 56:49.014
I'm going to throw you
off the roof.

56:54.019 --> 56:56.151
-Really?
-Yeah, hey.

57:01.766 --> 57:03.028
I love you.

57:35.364 --> 57:36.975
Hey, buddy.

57:37.018 --> 57:39.760
I gotta hit the road.

57:40.544 --> 57:42.023
But before I do,

57:42.067 --> 57:43.198
I wanted to give you this,

57:43.242 --> 57:46.158
like an early Christmas present.

57:47.986 --> 57:49.161
No way!

57:50.771 --> 57:51.946
This is amazing.

57:54.688 --> 57:56.081
Thank you.

58:01.434 --> 58:02.566
You're welcome.

58:09.224 --> 58:10.878
Melanie, I hate having
to tell you this,

58:10.922 --> 58:13.185
but he lied to you again.

58:13.228 --> 58:15.317
Jason didn't spend
Thanksgiving with Jamie

58:15.361 --> 58:17.319
or anyone from his family.

58:17.363 --> 58:23.151
Instead, he spent it
alone at a motel,

58:23.195 --> 58:24.805
just five miles from your house.

58:26.938 --> 58:29.027
No, that...

58:30.898 --> 58:32.291
that can't be true.

58:33.553 --> 58:34.946
I'm sorry.

58:36.469 --> 58:38.471
No, that's just,

58:38.515 --> 58:40.691
just not the Jason I know.

58:44.956 --> 58:46.348
It's just not.

58:47.045 --> 58:49.003
[gun firing]

58:49.047 --> 58:52.224
[suspenseful music]

59:39.140 --> 59:43.275
For someone who did a lot
of dumb and illegal shit,

59:43.318 --> 59:45.277
I find it fascinating
that the only thing

59:45.320 --> 59:46.539
on your brother's record,

59:46.583 --> 59:48.628
up until this point of course,

59:48.672 --> 59:50.630
was a shoplifting charge.

59:52.327 --> 59:55.461
Apparently, Jason stole
a dozen golf clubs.

59:59.030 --> 1:00:02.033
Did you also know that
your little brother

1:00:02.076 --> 1:00:03.382
had a habit of telling people

1:00:03.425 --> 1:00:05.036
that you and him had
a business together

1:00:05.079 --> 1:00:07.473
importing and exporting
golf equipment?

1:00:14.523 --> 1:00:18.266
I think you helped Jason rob
that golf store five years ago.

1:00:28.537 --> 1:00:31.802
-[David] Hey, how you doing?
-Fine, how can I help you?

1:00:31.845 --> 1:00:33.194
Yeah, you know what?

1:00:33.238 --> 1:00:35.066
I'm looking
for a couple new shirts.

1:00:35.109 --> 1:00:36.981
-[Clerk] Right this way.
-[David] Great.

1:00:38.069 --> 1:00:39.374
Is there particular?

1:01:05.270 --> 1:01:07.402
Yeah, I took the price
tags off of these clubs.

1:01:07.446 --> 1:01:10.579
I'm gonna make some new ones
in fucking Microsoft Paint.

1:01:10.623 --> 1:01:11.798
Well, why would you do that?

1:01:11.842 --> 1:01:13.800
What are you talking about?

1:01:13.844 --> 1:01:15.889
I'm going to take
these fucking clubs,

1:01:18.239 --> 1:01:20.111
and I'm going to scratch
some fucking Chinese symbols

1:01:20.154 --> 1:01:21.678
into the head of them,

1:01:21.721 --> 1:01:23.418
and then we're gonna
sell these motherfuckers

1:01:23.462 --> 1:01:26.030
to some dumb motherfucker
with some deep ass pockets.

1:01:26.073 --> 1:01:28.902
Wait, do you think anybody's
gonna fall for that shit?

1:01:28.946 --> 1:01:31.426
I mean, how stupid
do you think people are?

1:01:31.470 --> 1:01:34.865
Ah, I think they're pretty
fucking stupid.

1:01:34.908 --> 1:01:37.824
Plus bro, you forgot
the most important part.

1:01:37.868 --> 1:01:39.043
What's that?

1:01:39.086 --> 1:01:40.522
-It's me.
-Come on, bud.

1:01:40.566 --> 1:01:43.961
It's me, I could sell ice
to a motherfucking Eskimo.

1:01:44.004 --> 1:01:45.179
Have another sip.

1:01:46.267 --> 1:01:48.400
-[laughing]
-[siren blaring]

1:01:48.443 --> 1:01:51.272
Shit, shit! Shit.

1:01:52.273 --> 1:01:54.232
Oh, man.

1:01:54.275 --> 1:01:57.104
[laughing]

1:02:01.979 --> 1:02:03.894
Amy's gonna kill me.

1:02:03.937 --> 1:02:05.199
Amy's gonna fucking kill me.

1:02:05.243 --> 1:02:06.548
Dude, she's not going
to fucking kill you.

1:02:06.592 --> 1:02:09.073
No, no, she's gonna
call off the wedding.

1:02:09.116 --> 1:02:11.553
Okay, okay.
