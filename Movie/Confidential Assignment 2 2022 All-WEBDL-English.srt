1
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,717
You're the one who loses everything while trying to eat it all

2
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,843
Is money that good?

3
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,614
So let's see if this
money can save you?

4
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,936
Rim Cheol-ryeong sees
everything here, man

5
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:45,467
Do you forsake the Republic's
grace and become a drug dealer?

6
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,249
Aren't you ashamed to see your comrades?

7
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,819
I'm your girlfriend, because
I died right in front of you?

8
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,694
what did you do then

9
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,030
Hey, it's a shame to be lonely

10
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:12,007
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
this guy just pushed in

11
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,458
The criminal will be repatriated to the home country
according to the agreement between the DPRK and the U.S.

12
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,311
The Republic appreciates your cooperation

13
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,639
you now

14
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,061
Infringing on the privileges of diplomatic missions
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

15
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,331
ok, all light

16
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,202
allite

17
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:03,014
Thank you, Comrade Commander

18
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:05,073
It's the hundred dollars you gave me yesterday.

19
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,874
Bought as a gift for my daughter and mother

20
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,936
hundred dollars?

21
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,975
Wasn't it ten dollars from me?

22
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,607
It's changed, please change it

23
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:16,167
how about this?
I wrote it all down

24
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,883
Are you kidding me again?
Commander-in-chief is also...

25
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,739
I bought a few of these
to give to my mom.

26
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,015
- Get one of the captain's comrades.
- No job.

27
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,858
'Cause there's no one waiting for me

28
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,030
comrade

29
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,077
Hasn't a lot of time passed now?

30
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:38,125
Kikago

31
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,735
There are not only two Eminai who are
aiming for the team leader with tiger eyes.

32
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:45,363
If I was born with this
face, I wouldn't live in Ikago.

33
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,241
pula

34
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:23,962
comrade!

35
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:33,401
go go

36
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,836
This is Seoul Central District
Prosecutor's Office Kim Seung-yeon.

37
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:29,629
Are you Miyoung Kim?

38
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,256
My bankbook is used
for illegal transactions...

39
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,131
It seems that your personal information has been leaked

40
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,425
Yes, don't panic

41
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,344
The money in your
current account is at risk...

42
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,593
yes mother hello

43
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,237
That Jung-wook is
my friend Chang-hoon.

44
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,431
drink and hit people

45
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,887
I'm at the police station

46
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,472
- Mom?
- Hello, uh...

47
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,894
this...

48
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:48,064
no, see

49
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:49,816
No, change the script.

50
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:54,175
I keep blowing the rebroadcast so I keep my
eyes open and there's no response to this

51
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:57,714
-I can't eat me anymore.

52
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:00,160
It's because of your acting.
Why are you hitting the script?

53
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:05,184
Well, as you can see, it's just an
ordinary telemarketing company.

54
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,126
Well, I don't know which
mate would be a good fit.

55
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,838
I'm a little tired of this phone consultation
because it's emotional labor, yeah

56
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
Instead, you just
need to collect money.

57
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,260
1% of the collection goes to the allowance

58
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,268
not 1%

59
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,628
Fuck, if you get caught by
the cops doing a collection

60
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,558
I'm the only one getting fucked, fuck it

61
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,602
Looks like you're spending
some time on the floor

62
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,188
I was a resident in the
Philippines for 1 year.

63
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,690
He spent two years as a specialist in Yanbian.

64
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,942
That's what you said earlier

65
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:35,737
So, would you like
to write a script?

66
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,331
No, some people call me
a writer by the river, yeah

67
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,425
If you give me 5 million per
episode, I can give you a good rating.

68
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:46,082
No, what is this?

69
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:48,527
is this a camera?

70
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,418
You have great eyesight

71
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,404
Nothing else, I do
YouTube, that YouTuber

72
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,174
this savage!  jump out!

73
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:57,441
Hurry up!

74
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,667
Hey, stop moving.

75
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:01,941
- It's a cop.

76
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,129
oh, it hurts

77
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:04,864
bustle

78
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:08,978
My brother is Jintae Kang from
the Kwangsudae. You bastards, huh?

79
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:12,020
Cannon bankbook, cannon phone, counterfeit passport

80
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,026
Where did you get all that?

81
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,301
Who's the supply, you bastard!

82
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,573
supply book and nabal

83
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,667
I'm cold and hungry and I'm dying

84
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,371
No, when are you coming?

85
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:31,542
Hey, aren't you guys eating
something without me knowing?

86
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,970
I wish I could eat a bowl of hot noodles

87
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,394
- Hey, we're not bastards.

88
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,344
Hey, Gaekone, Gaeko,
who's not a detective?

89
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:48,410
Hey, hey, come, come, come

90
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,027
How many millions
of won do you need?

91
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,697
Look, see the perfect
hologram here?

92
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:03,491
Only me in Asia can make this

93
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:07,316
Where are you from?

94
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:09,214
russia?  Curry Ski?

95
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:10,433
kareisuki tea?

96
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,376
I came to my Korean grandfather's
hometown to earn money.

97
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,621
I live near Korea University.

98
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,402
so how many?

99
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,449
Excuse me

100
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,769
- Yes, you're in trouble.
- Are you the owner of this car?

101
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,724
Yes, yes, good work

102
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,225
- Police, Police
- That's it

103
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,746
When I look up the
car, it says cannon car.

104
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,347
yeah cops, cops

105
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,114
Sergey, Sergey!

106
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,487
A montage of the serial kidnapping of
women and girls in Bongcheon-dong...

107
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,780
I'm out of it

108
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,925
it's not like that

109
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:46,386
I'm the gangster,
the gangster...

110
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:47,808
Gwangju or Gwangsu, stay still

111
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,218
- You're not stingy, really.
- Stay still, be still.

112
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:51,861
- That's right, that's right.
- That's right, that's right.

113
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,916
You kidnapped women
using these handcuffs?

114
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,917
pervert chick

115
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,027
So get fake passports
to bounce abroad!

116
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,004
- Fake passports!
- Fake passports!

117
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,158
I, I am a cop, cop!

118
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,800
It's the Gwangsudae Police Station!
Gwangsudae!

119
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,597
After the undercover investigation of
this bastard caught almost everything...

120
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,544
hey!

121
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:13,605
Splash, bounce,
hurry, chase, chase!

122
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:21,355
Hey, you bastard, stand there!

123
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:27,492
stand up!
Stand up, you bastard!

124
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,516
baby like a magnet

125
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:02,538
Hey, yah la, put away the
ramen, put away the ramen

126
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,111
If it's sesame...

127
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,781
didn't eat

128
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,996
How did he hang upside down again?

129
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,440
If he falls, you have to stand up.

130
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,714
Hey, oh, oh, move it right

131
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,214
Hey, it's on the
left. Turn right!

132
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,385
Hey, I'm going to fall!

133
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:37,801
stop!

134
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,442
Be careful!

135
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,895
Don't cry, it's okay,
where's mom, mom?

136
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,356
- Where's mom, where's mom?
- Where's mama, go to mama

137
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,309
- it's okay?
- It must have been a disaster.

138
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,637
it's okay?  Are you really okay?

139
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:18,770
No, you should
have stopped there.

140
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,395
Seniors

141
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,690
Hey, blood!

142
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:26,652
what kind of blood is this

143
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:28,574
No, why are you here...

144
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,366
hey hey...

145
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,332
really...

146
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:43,440
I bought a cell phone
from a used country.

147
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,479
Head hurts

148
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:50,134
Received the parcel and found that there
were only chicken bones in the chicken box?

149
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,433
There was also a
plastic bag, so I opened it.

150
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:55,613
Well, shit...

151
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:56,669
shit?

152
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:00,754
Star, you crazy bastard...

153
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,621
How much shit was
there as much as this?

154
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:06,997
this much

155
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,569
is that human shit?

156
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,316
On May 6th, after an argument in the
PC room in Banghak-dong, both sides...

157
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,408
Are you talking about assault on both sides?

158
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,452
No, then this is
just plain assault.

159
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,848
Hey, why are the cybercriminals
investigating simple assault?

160
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,266
Who received this?

161
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:21,832
I...

162
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,834
Is it a cyber crime to be a
fan of people in a PC room?

163
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,753
Beat people with the keyboard

164
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,455
Hey, if you're a fan of
cybercriminals with a keyboard

165
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,051
Is losing money a financial crime?

166
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,678
So what, if you hit a
calculator, what's digital crime?

167
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,176
- Sorry.
- Genius.

168
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:41,077
gun!

169
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:52,481
The General Reconnaissance Bureau found
traces of Jang Myung-jun in Hanoi, Vietnam.

170
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:55,278
But my head hurts

171
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:59,370
They say they entered South
Korea with fake passports.

172
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,073
Yes?

173
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:02,915
In the past, during the march of hardship, the
military's foreign currency earning business was

174
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:05,334
The military's 915 research
lab produced the Bingdu.

175
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:08,462
Didn't the party banned it because it
became a problem both inside and outside?

176
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,295
Jang Myung-joon,
who tasted this dollar

177
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:15,136
Disappeared with a
billion dollar Swiss account

178
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,512
Couldn't that money be enough
to feed the entire republic?

179
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,558
Why did you choose South Korea?

180
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:23,894
Guddy there is a money book in
the south that manages $1 billion

181
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,247
Kim Chul-soo, who was in charge
of the 915 Lab's Bingdu production

182
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:39,911
What if Jang Myung-joon and Kim
Cheol-soo were captured by the US?

183
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,872
Peace agreement or whatever,
the march of suffering begins again

184
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:48,461
The meeting place has been
changed from Singapore to Seoul.

185
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,756
The negotiations with the South
are over, so go down immediately.

186
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,008
A week later, we
have our representative

187
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,489
i went to seoul

188
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,535
Until then, I found the money
book and met Jang Myung-joon.

189
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,223
Bring all the billions

190
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,856
Sprinkle the rice cakes

191
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,653
gather the meat

192
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:22,559
Capitalism is good, hey

193
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:25,996
oh my, you're alive

194
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:29,186
I was very surprised to
hear that he was arrested.

195
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:35,651
This, boss Joe, you
did not worry about me

196
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:39,457
I also wondered if it was the
fact that my boss was chubby

197
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:42,144
- Could it be?
- Yes.

198
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,951
You are the vessel for that

199
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:45,870
What happened to the money you prepared?

200
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,160
I told you before

201
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:50,374
If you suddenly recover your
investment, you will lose a lot of money.

202
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,209
Take some time to trust me...

203
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:14,036
Eminai is so pretty, hey

204
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:18,778
My daughter Young-soon
is alive, but it's just this age.

205
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,130
you

206
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,567
Have you ever eaten salted
fish salted with human flesh?

207
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:34,911
no taste beluga

208
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,256
Don't make something to taste

209
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:41,342
I'll give you 3 days

210
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,669
in red color

211
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:56,333
I'll shade you

212
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:58,122
The mascara is carefully

213
00:21:58,123 --> 00:22:01,387
like this, slowly

214
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:03,772
complete

215
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:06,801
Today at the Berlin club, very hip

216
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:09,614
I took a look at the
original smokey makeup

217
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:10,715
how about it?

218
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:14,442
Min-young's make-over show that
will be appreciated if you follow it

219
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:16,536
That's all for today

220
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:19,241
Subscribe and like are love

221
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,462
Why?

222
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:25,606
Hey, how many times
did you call me to eat, huh?

223
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,497
- I'm annoyed.
- Hurry up!

224
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,465
- I'm so bored I'm dying.
- Because of you, I have to film again.

225
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,074
What the hell is this?

226
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,805
I have to take you, but I'm coming out

227
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,473
Can't you see I'm working right now?

228
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,255
Is it your job to paint your face?

229
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:40,956
I sent them to me because I went to a makeup
academy, but I didn't get a job and what I was doing

230
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:43,112
Okay, okay, love what, this...

231
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,442
My sister doesn't know what
to say, but being a YouTuber

232
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:49,410
Hopefully she can earn
over 100 million a month?

233
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,005
- really?
- yes

234
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:53,895
so?  How much did her aunt earn?

235
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,293
- 36,000 won
- A day?

236
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,020
I just got a profit,
got it in a year

237
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:01,105
- A year?
- erai

238
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,527
Not a month, but a year?

239
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,718
36,000 won in 365 days
is about 100 won a day.

240
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:06,969
Yuna

241
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,597
Don't be like that,
aunt, call me like this

242
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,945
- Why are you doing this to your brother-in-law?
- How are you?

243
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,723
I was also good when I was young

244
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,629
I feel bad, I don't eat

245
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:19,481
Uh, don't eat, don't eat

246
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,719
- Hey, why are you
doing this again?

247
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,605
Let go, you did
well, okay, let this go.

248
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,925
- Hey, you don't eat?
- Are you going to take it right away like that?

249
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:25,613
done

250
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,877
Hey, what are you doing
with your toys, at work?

251
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,431
Isn't that a toy?
The world has changed a lot

252
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:45,341
They also search for missing people
and crack down on traffic violations.

253
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,801
Amman, even if the world changes

254
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:50,862
Investigation runs on your feet,
and the detective fills in handcuffs.

255
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,033
Sunbaenim came to the
cyber investigation team.

256
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:55,979
You're going to get something like a license right now.

257
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,519
Do you think I'm going to rot here?

258
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,439
I will somehow return to
Kwangsudae, wait and see

259
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:03,442
- But is the rumor true?
- What?

260
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:06,362
I heard you had a big case
with a North Korean detective...

261
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:08,739
- Did you hear me?
- Yes

262
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,907
- you also?
- Yes

263
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:15,569
How can this nigga
have no secrets, I am

264
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,164
really...

265
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,979
There was such a thing as a super note copper
plate that would destroy the world economy.

266
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:31,345
The North Korean detective's
name was Im Cheol-ryeong, who

267
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:35,849
If it's not my brother, I'll follow
you around and rely on you

268
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,229
I'll do it like this

269
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:43,107
I wish we could take on a
big case like that too, really

270
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,214
If you're a police officer, at least once...

271
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,611
What's wrong with him?

272
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:48,612
hey!

273
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:50,456
uh

274
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,742
What, a cheol-ryeong?
you're lying

275
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:55,584
Really

276
00:24:55,585 --> 00:24:57,329
- Really?
- okay

277
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:00,973
I'm coming down as a preparation team
for the North Korea-U.S. summit next week.

278
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:01,734
yes

279
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,586
No, what's the story? It's
probably the same as last time.

280
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,190
No, but he's coming
to catch a drug dealer.

281
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,354
- Would the NIS believe that?
- by the way?

282
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:14,104
I was trying to select a detective to partner
with Lim Cheol-ryeong from among the applicants.

283
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:15,014
yes

284
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:18,096
No, nobody has any applicants.

285
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:18,987
why?

286
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:22,146
Last time, there was a rumor that my
brother and my family were all about to die.

287
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,064
- Uh
- Everyone is taking care of themselves.

288
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:25,854
so now

289
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,944
Is it the same as Seoul National
University Law School's underachievement?

290
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:29,666
right

291
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,739
As long as you apply, you just pass.

292
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,074
Hey, then why are
you doing this to me?

293
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:35,743
I have a wedding date set

294
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:36,760
suddenly?

295
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,666
- So what about you?
- I'm in 3rd grade.

296
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,464
Hey, the kid is taking the
exam. Are you taking the exam?

297
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,210
So you, you, are you going to stay
in the cybercrime in these uniforms?

298
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,504
- Won't you come back to Kwangsudae?
- I have to

299
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,080
I'm suddenly worried

300
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:54,011
Man, if my wife found
out, she'd do it to kill me.

301
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,181
- What, Mr. Cheol-ryeong?
- That person again?

302
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:59,099
- why?
- No, what

303
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,822
Simple, I guess I got a
nigga to catch a nigga

304
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,905
Did you forget that our family
almost died the last time?

305
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,345
- uh?
- How do I forget that?

306
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:07,768
But why are you talking about it again?

307
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:10,158
Maybe, maybe, again, you...

308
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,195
- uh?
- it's crazy?

309
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,197
What kind of detective
am I in Korea?

310
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,491
But yeah, a human with a
brain would never do that

311
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:18,659
But who are you
coming to catch this time?

312
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,454
- What...
- Maybe

313
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,253
Aren't you coming to catch me?

314
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,893
It must have been harder
than dying, forgetting me

315
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:27,503
Are you serious?

316
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,055
Another start, another start

317
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:31,006
Cheol-ryeong said that
we would meet again

318
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,264
That's just saying we'll see you when
we're unified as a greeting, that's it

319
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,260
No, I can't stand it until then

320
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,259
I can't stand it because of you

321
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,015
No, don't you know that men don't
cover fire when they fall in love?

322
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,476
Live the way you feel comfortable, huh?

323
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,853
- Longevity.
- This is not the time, now.

324
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:48,431
Hey, what, did Cheol-ryeong
tell you to meet you, huh?

325
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:52,986
really...

326
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:56,338
If you come in contact by any
chance, will you just let it go?

327
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,003
okay okay

328
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,368
If you get involved with that person
again, it's just a divorce, divorce.

329
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,787
- okay?  uh?
- okay okay

330
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,104
Where's your brother-in-law's
emergency fund?

331
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,220
Where are you?

332
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,120
this is kinda weird...

333
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:44,962
stay here

334
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:47,456
Oh yeah...

335
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,955
really...

336
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:54,034
Somehow, the air
purifier didn't work at all.

337
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,968
uh, uh, what's up?

338
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:00,512
no i

339
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:03,223
Did you ever sneak a peek at that wife?

340
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,471
When Cheol-ryeong talked
about it, it just jumped and jumped.

341
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:07,635
uh?  That's divorce

342
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,688
No, it's okay to do that, well

343
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,581
Uh, but that... just make sure

344
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:14,955
Are you sure you are responsible
for the return of Kwangsudae?

345
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:18,271
No, I have to risk my
life to catch some culprit.

346
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,282
I'm risking my life
to deceive my wife

347
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,437
huh, great

348
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,900
- Brother-in-law.
- What are you doing here?

349
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,662
With Cheol-ryeong again?
Are you cheating on your sister?

350
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,915
- No, no.
- Great.

351
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,309
- No, no, no...
- Sister, sister!

352
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,205
huh?

353
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:35,464
Will you give me money?
36 million won?

354
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,007
10 years of YouTube

355
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,091
So how much?

356
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,843
20 years, 30 years?

357
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:43,305
50 years?  Then how are you?

358
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:45,265
- 1.8 million won?
- hey

359
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:48,768
Then it's my 1 year
allowance, you want all of it?

360
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:50,145
Sister, un...

361
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,838
Okay, I'll give you

362
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,191
- Then take that and get one more.
- What?

363
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,447
Before you go,
Mr. Cheol-ryeong, let me meet you.

364
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,151
Hey, he must have his
own taste, is that up to me?

365
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,956
- Okay, okay, I'll try.
- Okay?

366
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:02,866
I really promised

367
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,674
- Okay, instead...
- Okay, uh

368
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:07,151
of course, of course

369
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,557
dazzling, really

370
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,474
Is there only a last name detective in South Korea?

371
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:24,930
ok i am one

372
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,848
oh my, it's been a while

373
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:29,971
uh?  No guns?

374
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,323
Cooperation Rule 1

375
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,857
The gun is kept by the South Korean detective.

376
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:39,361
Now you know how to do it

377
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,159
Hey, there's a second rule

378
00:29:41,424 --> 00:29:44,491
- The use of illegal weapons is prohibited.
- Yes?

379
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:47,744
I mean don't beat people up with a roll
of toilet paper or something like that.

380
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:49,284
Got it

381
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:51,682
I'm so hungry

382
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:53,500
Let's go eat first

383
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:55,534
Hey, what's going on?

384
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:57,170
He said that we would do an investigation first.

385
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,215
Let's take care of the naked people
with the southern compatriot tax

386
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,260
Hey, is that what you look
like naked, you bastard...

387
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,262
how about eel?

388
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,825
- Good.
- Okay.

389
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:30,497
Oil flows revolutionary

390
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,708
What do you guys put the
revolution on everywhere?

391
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,167
What do you mean by kika?

392
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,628
When I'm emphasizing
something here

393
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,506
I'm adding a ruler to the end of the word

394
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:45,260
Like shit, shit

395
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,763
try it once

396
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:49,146
How does oil flow?

397
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,013
oil is flowing

398
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,105
Hey, Cheol-ryeong is really good

399
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,504
What is this operation?

400
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:05,864
Well, eavesdropping
or hacking, or...

401
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:08,557
Well, you can pretend
to be investigating

402
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:10,328
- Well, just do what you say.
- Investigate.

403
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,953
- FM Boulevard
- Yes?

404
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:14,289
I want you to do your research properly.

405
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:17,042
During the investigation, the information is called cache.

406
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:20,153
Have you come to catch a drug dealer?

407
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,130
Surely there must be a plot

408
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,802
hey

409
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,269
Honestly what this time?

410
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,905
Isn't it that Jang Myung-jun
came to catch a drug dealer?

411
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:45,278
he ate terribly well

412
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,947
huh?  What is he saying now?

413
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,185
I can't hear...
Hey, turn up the volume

414
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:50,075
Yes

415
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,876
Shameful, Shameful, Really

416
00:32:01,372 --> 00:32:02,712
Let the investigation begin

417
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:04,739
Why are you in such a hurry?

418
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,536
hey go slow

419
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:11,278
Are you both agents?

420
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:12,512
- No
- Yes

421
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:14,599
- No
- Yes

422
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:22,435
these tattooed bastards

423
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:25,341
They're probably distributing
new drugs to finance their escape.

424
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:27,696
And again?

425
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:32,033
In addition?  Is this all?

426
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,411
I was taught that investigations
are done with the feet.

427
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:39,458
Man, that's a thing of the past,
these days it's all about forensics

428
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,502
Is there any concept of
scientific investigation there?

429
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:45,599
Well, just put all the scientists
together to make missiles.

430
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,161
There is no such thing
as a scientific investigation

431
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,888
the concept could be

432
00:32:56,528 --> 00:32:59,536
What can a castle
like that be pointy?

433
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:03,122
There's a revolutionary way

434
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:04,997
oh, jonggu

435
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,152
Yes, there is a picture I sent you.

436
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,029
I need to find someone who deals with it?

437
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,263
Show me a demonstration
of Korean forensic science

438
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:13,074
Yes, I checked your photo.

439
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,547
Well then!

440
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:28,153
red pill

441
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,343
- Sprinkle some rice cakes.
- Okay.

442
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,918
Senior, let's start
with rice cakes

443
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,186
Hey, how do you get a bite?

444
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,897
Yes, it can be delivered in
30 minutes by motorcycle?

445
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:46,650
- Send me a photo. Yeah.
- Yeah, I get it.

446
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,153
Yes, I asked you for rice cakes.

447
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,197
ok, yes

448
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,866
nice

449
00:33:58,332 --> 00:33:59,527
forensic investigation

450
00:34:00,113 --> 00:34:03,833
Now, all you have to do is find a suspicious
motorcycle that goes round and round around you.

451
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,582
Did you know?  Come on, fight

452
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,457
uh?  there!

453
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,933
please enlarge

454
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:35,198
Okay, suspect found. The flower bed
on the west side of the Anguk Building.

455
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:36,950
OK

456
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,288
hey hey here it is

457
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:48,043
Hey, where are you going?

458
00:34:48,863 --> 00:34:50,547
Hang on with it?
I have to rush over

459
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,382
Hey, there's a flying guy on top of a running nigga

460
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,050
I have a smart guy above him

461
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,803
Don't worry, CCTV's
watching, huh?

462
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,930
Yes, the suspect is
currently moving south

463
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,691
worried

464
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,875
Worried about getting hurt?

465
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,377
Yeah, I'm afraid those
bastards will get hurt

466
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:31,113
go fast

467
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:33,332
OK

468
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:44,668
Excuse me

469
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:47,312
Rumors spread that this
place is a ppong restaurant.

470
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:49,481
Who is the oldest?

471
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:51,024
you?

472
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,160
No, fuck, this isn't some
kind of convenience store.

473
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:55,161
What is this, dogs and
cows all come in here, huh?

474
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:57,934
The restaurant is so unfriendly.

475
00:35:57,935 --> 00:36:01,042
Hey, kneel knees, huh?

476
00:36:01,848 --> 00:36:03,022
Hey, get down on your knees

477
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:05,413
Hey, kneel, these babies
all!

478
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,165
salty?

479
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,058
this kid this
Is your manners bad?

480
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,545
how to put it to the face
It's salty, isn't it?

481
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,613
Heck, a little bit

482
00:36:13,614 --> 00:36:16,216
oops, true
Got something to suck on, really

483
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:18,426
Stay still, dear...

484
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,721
- Are you and your daughter here?
- If you do not comply with the arrest

485
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:23,598
exercise the right to self-defense

486
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,474
What are you talking about, what is this?

487
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,476
Hey, I'm asking because I'm worried about hyung.

488
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:29,417
Do you have your actual expenses insurance?

489
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:33,472
What kind of bullshit are you talking about?

490
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,930
- Dude.
- Yes.

491
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:39,864
I've been hiding a lot

492
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,200
Where are you?
Better to just go, eh?

493
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,118
Go in

494
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,619
go, go, go

495
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,604
Go, you bastard, go, huh?

496
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,081
What?  this bastard, this

497
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:50,128
Hey, hey, hey, what tongue, go

498
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,586
This baby, I caught, this

499
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:56,949
Hit it!

500
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,628
Hey, you bastard!

501
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:36,308
Ugh, look at these bastards, this?

502
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:39,152
Cheoryeong-ah, the ban on the
use of weapons is lifted for 5 minutes

503
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:40,636
One minute is enough

504
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:41,926
okay?

505
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:31,207
hey

506
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,464
Hang on, you bastard

507
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,104
Yeah I'm salty, nigga

508
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,160
Got a kid

509
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,332
The baby is all caught up

510
00:38:40,615 --> 00:38:42,128
Where did you get this medicine?

511
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:45,615
It's the first time I've seen them,
so I left them to open a deal.

512
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,847
Did you talk like a Korean-Chinese?

513
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,995
They say it looks like it needs a power
supply, so they just spray it at a cheap price.

514
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,792
What is this, a mart event?

515
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:55,752
You said you should try the
mulberry and threw it away?

516
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,418
Eh, ing, me too

517
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,276
They told me to wash my
hands after handling this sample.

518
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:02,066
You need to brush your tongue properly.

519
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:05,785
what is this

520
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:08,888
Hey, this is an aggravated
punishment for the rest of my life.

521
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,050
I'll live until I poop
out of the bread?

522
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,745
You don't have to prepare for old age

523
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:13,851
- Brothers!
- yes?

524
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:16,672
What are you going to do in
this alley business area like me?

525
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:19,148
I will cooperate so
that I can catch them

526
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,526
only once
Please forgive me just once, really

527
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,986
How will you cooperate?

528
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,764
After a while, those bastards over this way
I'm coming to get money

529
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:27,694
when?

530
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:33,935
right?

531
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,155
uh, are you here?

532
00:39:54,585 --> 00:39:55,560
how...

533
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,453
We got the stuff
as promised, huh?

534
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,101
Why is your top like that?

535
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,907
this?

536
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,285
Korean police, don't move!

537
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:17,030
Rim Cheol-ryeong?
How are you here?

538
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,654
Did you die then?

539
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:19,959
Where is Jang Myung-Jun?

540
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:23,568
hey Mr.

541
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,624
Uh, Jonggu, there
was a crash here.

542
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:00,991
send an ambulance

543
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:21,419
What did you say?

544
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:22,856
I have a concussion

545
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:25,641
You're only waking up tomorrow
morning because of the tranquilizer?

546
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:28,364
Mr. Cheol-ryeong Lim

547
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,698
No, how long have you been here?

548
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:34,033
What are you Robocop, huh?

549
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:36,452
Then what, the culprit is a
rabbit right in front of you?

550
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:38,457
Where are you talking to your boss?

551
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,998
you can't, come with me

552
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,291
- what?
- Follow!

553
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:43,668
why?

554
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:47,547
No, because Cheoryeong is
difficult to control, so that's about it.

555
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,083
I know, I know, I know, I know

556
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,176
good job, good job

557
00:41:53,419 --> 00:41:54,581
yes, huh?

558
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:57,098
You caught the guy on
the red wanted for Interpol.

559
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,934
Is that all?
Only 3kg of drugs confiscated

560
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,942
Our team has completed one
year's worth of performance.

561
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:03,187
okay?

562
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:06,325
Something smells fishy.

563
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,784
What did you find out
from Lim Cheol-ryung?

564
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:11,528
Let's watch the viewer's
report video together

565
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:14,157
- The 17-to-one fight that I only
heard of in words - Hey, hey, hey, hey

566
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:15,533
- In the middle of downtown
Seoul - Hey, Min Young-ah

567
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,279
- It happened.
- Isn't that Cheol Spirit?

568
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:17,676
Look, there's Cheol-ryeong

569
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:20,003
Cheol-ryeong, iron, Cheol-ryeong!

570
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:23,285
As soon as it arrives,
it's just churning around.

571
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:24,630
How are people here?

572
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:26,458
No, how is it the same as last time?

573
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,598
equally cool

574
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:32,008
Hey, I got it and told him not
to mess with Lim Cheol-ryeong.

575
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:35,746
This time again, what kind of detective will go
through hardship instead of your brother-in-law?

576
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:37,388
Iron spirit!

577
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:39,590
for a moment

578
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,950
Police find the suspect...

579
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:42,451
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

580
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:44,692
That human again!

581
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:52,247
Cheol-ryeong secretly brought it
with a cannon phone and a passport.

582
00:42:53,457 --> 00:42:54,947
Hey, hey, good job, good job

583
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,614
I will analyze this

584
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,082
Like last time,
Cheol-ryeong takes you home

585
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,450
- Bob is Meg, alcohol is Meg.
- Are you crazy?

586
00:43:01,637 --> 00:43:03,414
Do you want to
see your wife die?

587
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,699
- Dad, answer the phone.
- What?

588
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:08,270
- Don't pretend to be busy, take it.
- Hey

589
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,786
Daddy, answer the phone

590
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,174
- Uh, honey, why?
- Hey, are you going to die?

591
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,137
Come rush home with Lim Cheol-ryeong!

592
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:17,220
I don't know where the iron spirit is

593
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:21,661
Did you forget that my family almost died?

594
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:23,770
But why do you come again, huh?

595
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:25,937
No, I'm not here

596
00:43:26,238 --> 00:43:28,473
I said I didn't like
it, but Cheol-ryeong

597
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,684
If it's my brother, I can't,
I can't, I can't, I have...

598
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:32,360
Yes?  when i...

599
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:34,372
sister

600
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:36,906
It was Mr. Cheol-ryeong who
saved that near-death thing.

601
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:38,184
yes mom

602
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,770
Even if I bow down to the
life saver, it's not enough

603
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:42,325
- It's starting again.
- It's been a while.

604
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:44,455
hey, it's not like this

605
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:48,334
No, this time it's just a deal
to catch a few drug lords

606
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,545
It's not like I just fired a gun
like last time, so don't worry

607
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,001
That’s right, Cheol-ryeong, huh?

608
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:53,089
Guilty

609
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,114
- Sister
- Mom

610
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:57,239
Mr. Cheol-ryeong

611
00:43:57,928 --> 00:44:00,638
Our house here
is really nice, right?

612
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:03,224
yes, that's great

613
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:06,477
But even if it looks like mine,
it's not ours, neither is the car.

614
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,489
The house I live in is not mine

615
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,731
Everything belongs to the party.

616
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:12,583
uh, right

617
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:15,778
It's similar, but it's all
about debt, it's all about debt

618
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,371
So, until we pay off this debt,
my father and I have to stay alive.

619
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:20,324
No, what am I, a
money making machine?

620
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,052
Machines make good money

621
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:23,327
really...

622
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,168
Anyway, a man's face should look
so handsome like Cheol-ryeong again.

623
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:36,153
What's so good about
a face like mine...

624
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,843
Ji's face is said to be a common face

625
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:41,345
Hey, if you have
a common face, I...

626
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,014
Aww, really...

627
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:45,286
Ji's face is said to be a common face

628
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:46,403
does not make sense...

629
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:48,137
sit up straight

630
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:55,802
Noisy, wash quickly and eat rice

631
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,111
okay

632
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:00,156
What to eat at the Great Wall?
huh?

633
00:45:16,895 --> 00:45:18,704
And make me a sinner too?

634
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:20,059
hey, sorry

635
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:23,012
How much would you
have missed the scene?

636
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:24,931
Amman is like that too.

637
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,489
By precisely separating the public and private...

638
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,018
Yeah, I can't separate his
public and private affairs

639
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:32,645
I threw the Super Note copper plate into
the sea, so I couldn't get a promotion.

640
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:34,273
- It's like this...
- It's not even an ethmoid bone.

641
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:35,566
How many times do you boil it?

642
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:39,606
So, hyung, give me a
promotion once in a while, please.

643
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:42,817
Hey, let's be honest
with each other for once

644
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:44,223
Myung-Jun Jang

645
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:47,684
What is that baby, do you hit
the red wanted at the interpol?

646
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:57,296
He was smuggling Bingdu to
and from the Korea-China border.

647
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,684
As his crackdown intensified, he
moved his base to North America.

648
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:01,598
A new type of bingdu that is highly addictive

649
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,969
He's a bad guy who
made and sold in bulk.

650
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,471
New Bingdu?

651
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:09,432
It is characterized in that it can be mass-produced
with easily available chemical substances.

652
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,466
But for what purpose
did we come to Korea?

653
00:46:12,467 --> 00:46:14,543
I want to run away,
but there are more

654
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:18,207
- That's...
- That's it?

655
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,569
I wonder too

656
00:46:22,677 --> 00:46:25,567
Did you have any clues
from that guy earlier?

657
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,827
Well, a cell phone or something,
your belongings or something.

658
00:46:28,097 --> 00:46:29,465
there was no

659
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:34,231
Hey, I'll buy you
that beer, yeah

660
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:35,354
no beer

661
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:38,525
I'm going to buy you a beer,
so grab a bite to eat, huh?

662
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:42,934
Gwangyong was caught by the police

663
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:44,301
But why?

664
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,012
Rim Cheol-ryeong was with me

665
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:48,184
Rim Cheol-ryeong?

666
00:46:55,129 --> 00:46:57,982
It's going to be shit
in the republic, hey

667
00:46:58,317 --> 00:46:59,223
bread

668
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:14,989
this isn't it

669
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,536
What do you mean?

670
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,549
out of site out of mind

671
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,677
I just made up my mind, but
if it shows up like this again...

672
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:32,504
You're here because of
me. Is work an excuse?

673
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:35,728
No, I'm really here for work.

674
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:36,880
lie

675
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:40,716
Yes?

676
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:46,848
But why can't you
look into my eyes?

677
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:50,302
I'm sorry about that

678
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,953
- What?
- Don't you know?

679
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,581
It's not realistic

680
00:47:56,926 --> 00:47:59,809
No, why does Mr. Cheol-ryeong
decide that, yes?

681
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,177
Why give up before you even try?

682
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:10,889
Gikamun...

683
00:48:11,436 --> 00:48:13,975
Comrade Min Young, try to
unify the north and the south.

684
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:16,936
Kiritamunya, did you
have any problems?

685
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:22,928
How do I unify?

686
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:28,154
really...

687
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,038
How to unify...

688
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,967
It seems that Jang
Myung-joon farts in America.

689
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:45,798
No, why did he have
to come to Korea?

690
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:46,913
Well, are you curious?

691
00:48:47,147 --> 00:48:49,358
who am i  I also asked

692
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:50,428
what is iron spirit?

693
00:48:50,796 --> 00:48:52,139
I'm curious about the map

694
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:55,099
No, I have to figure
it out, this frustrating

695
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,147
Hey, what kind of vending
machine do I press and it comes out?

696
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:58,998
wait a minute

697
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:06,217
Wait a minute

698
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:16,078
It's a surprise

699
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:17,913
did you notice

700
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,256
I haven't eaten anything...

701
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:29,925
It's done, it's done, but why

702
00:49:30,272 --> 00:49:31,719
I mean a suit

703
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:34,263
Isn't that bastard a rip off?

704
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:36,807
no, the little bastard

705
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:40,227
Tap me on the shoulder
What, good, good?

706
00:49:41,053 --> 00:49:42,521
I swear by it...

707
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:44,648
I think someone put it in with a parachute.

708
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,639
There was that super note last time, he
said he drank water because he missed it

709
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,920
No, did I?

710
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:51,608
No, because Jiji looks
like a head, he drank water.

711
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,824
I thought it was a water-drinking hippo

712
00:49:54,216 --> 00:49:57,530
- Uh, hang up, hang up, okay, uh
- yeah, yeah, get in

713
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:01,999
Unless it's the wiretapping, I'm not alone

714
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:03,529
yes

715
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:09,092
- Hey, wake up.
- What are you talking about?

716
00:50:09,553 --> 00:50:11,381
Why, huh?

717
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:12,626
- Wake up.
- No, why?

718
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:14,264
- I don't know.
- What's wrong with Min-young?

719
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:15,833
- Calm down, girl.
- No, I just

720
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:19,052
- You say patriotism with your face and face.
- Did you drink this?

721
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:22,478
Does this mean I have
to go to unification?

722
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,639
It's time to do it once

723
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,441
I'm really like him.
What should I do, really?

724
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,467
- It's a habit, it's a habit.

725
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:32,108
yes let's go

726
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,572
- Yuna's mom, don't worry about it, don't worry about it
- Hey, it's embarrassing

727
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,737
I can't live, really

728
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:36,325
Honey, call the cops, cops

729
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:38,708
Well, I'm a cop,
so I can take you.

730
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:52,022
No, why is pork belly in the morning?

731
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:54,671
What is illegal to eat in the morning?

732
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,929
Hey, with what money?

733
00:50:57,695 --> 00:50:59,123
Did you give him pocket money again?

734
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,092
I don't even want to die

735
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:05,257
Cheol-ryeong, I cooked this
deliciously, so please eat a lot.

736
00:51:05,258 --> 00:51:07,358
Originally, Koreans are rice-shim.

737
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:08,780
- No work.
- No, fast.

738
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:10,826
- Why are you so embarrassed?
- Try it first.

739
00:51:10,827 --> 00:51:11,866
money should run out

740
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:13,365
- I'd go out and beg.
- It's delicious, right?

741
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:16,257
I'm making money. What's
wrong with being a YouTuber?

742
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:17,533
Mom

743
00:51:18,944 --> 00:51:19,535
uh, eat

744
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,829
Didn't you see the
piggy bank on my desk?

745
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:24,498
- Look for it.
- I can't find it.

746
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:28,836
I mean, I worked really
hard to buy the BTS album.

747
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,163
Bulletproof Boy Scouts?

748
00:51:31,163 --> 00:51:32,999
There's something wrong with South Korea, hey

749
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,663
My uncle is also from the Chosun Boys.

750
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:41,757
It's been fun, huh?

751
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:42,971
Where did you go?

752
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:44,686
hey you look good

753
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,312
That thief bitch, me, hey

754
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:49,940
I, hey, you thought I was you

755
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,479
- It's just noisy in the morning
- Hey, you're doing it now.

756
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:52,312
- In front of Cheol-ryeong
- My nephew's money?

757
00:51:52,314 --> 00:51:53,036
what?

758
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:53,777
- Do not come!
- Anyway, really.

759
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,754
- Open the door quickly.
- Just jingle.

760
00:51:54,754 --> 00:51:56,238
- What if I say that to Mr. Cheol-ryeong?
- Just like people who don't exist...

761
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,676
open the door, hurry up

762
00:51:58,179 --> 00:51:59,083
- Hey, open it.
- What's up, since morning?

763
00:51:59,090 --> 00:51:59,988
Yes Yes

764
00:52:00,372 --> 00:52:02,311
- Get out.
- Uh, okay, yeah

765
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,061
Hey, Kim Kwang-yong is awake.

766
00:52:04,576 --> 00:52:05,539
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

767
00:52:06,472 --> 00:52:07,475
no no

768
00:52:07,477 --> 00:52:08,979
- Why do you always say things to me?
- I don't have time to eat.

769
00:52:08,979 --> 00:52:10,502
I don't have time to eat

770
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:15,632
Did I say no?

771
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,662
- Are you the culprit?
- let's hurry

772
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:18,927
come out quickly!

773
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,391
Yes, thank you. Let's go in.

774
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,654
I'm under investigation
now, so go back.

775
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:27,436
What are you talking about?

776
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:29,897
Now it's under our foreign affairs
team, so Detective Kang is out of the way.

777
00:52:30,031 --> 00:52:31,179
no, what...

778
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,240
I'm talking nonsense

779
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:35,623
Hey, who are you?

780
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:37,905
Yes?

781
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:39,156
yes ok...

782
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:41,241
do you know someone

783
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:47,850
this one is mine now

784
00:52:48,694 --> 00:52:50,171
Kanna

785
00:52:50,976 --> 00:52:53,147
Knowing how to speak Korean
did you deceive me?

786
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:54,663
when did you ask

787
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:56,647
didn't you ask?

788
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:00,302
put away the pieces of paper

789
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:02,471
because i caught it
i went to interrogation

790
00:53:04,124 --> 00:53:05,057
this...

791
00:53:06,092 --> 00:53:07,768
Is it a situation you've seen a lot?

792
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:10,020
Who is it that I missed
Jang Myung-Jun?

793
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,889
Wow, are you following me all the
way here and making a mess of dogs?

794
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:12,983
because of me?

795
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:19,947
Did I tell you?

796
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:22,658
How can you trust a North Korean
who secretly makes nuclear bombs?

797
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,147
You guys come with nuclear
weapons, are you saying we can't?

798
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:28,874
yes

799
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:31,780
can't figure out anything

800
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:33,788
took all my fortune

801
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:36,811
Hey, you don't have a fortune, you
say your house belongs to the party

802
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:37,858
- castle!
- hey

803
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:41,051
I don't know what's going
on now, put it all down

804
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,819
Come on, come on, let's talk

805
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:45,681
Hey, Hello, Hello Exuse Me

806
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:47,599
Nice to meet you
I'm Korean, the...

807
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,350
Detective

808
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:51,710
Nice to meet you

809
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:55,816
- uh?  - Are you Ant-Man?

810
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:57,651
Autumn, high temperature

811
00:53:58,099 --> 00:53:59,645
Am I Ant-Man?

812
00:54:00,146 --> 00:54:02,764
I'm just trying to offend you in the
first place. When have you seen me?

813
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,921
you, what, what...

814
00:54:05,187 --> 00:54:07,576
Wendy You...
Wow Wendy You Mr....

815
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:08,813
under...

816
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,896
I'm prestrading

817
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:12,615
jin tae ya, jin tae ya

818
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,418
Control your load properly!

819
00:54:14,426 --> 00:54:15,795
sorry, sorry

820
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,655
Come on, Detective
Kang, let's get out.

821
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:20,356
- You know, anyone you know?
- Hurry up

822
00:54:20,413 --> 00:54:21,372
Lim Cheol-ryeong, come quickly!

823
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:22,384
see me at once

824
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:02,624
How do you stop the
FBI from attacking?

825
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:04,510
Even the FBI...

826
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:07,553
Seeing this happen

827
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,350
I'm sure there's something
more to it than a Super Note.

828
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:12,600
We have to find out what it is.

829
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,631
Gotta have some clues,
whatever, I'll figure it out

830
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:18,206
What did you find out of
the confiscated belongings?

831
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,507
phone is being restored

832
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:22,420
I checked my passport.

833
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:25,248
A technician who can
perfectly forge that hologram

834
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:27,115
Well, there aren't many in the world.

835
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,928
See the perfect hologram?

836
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:32,530
Only me in Asia can make this

837
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:33,497
Sergey!

838
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,958
- Yeah, Sergey.
- Sergey.

839
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,670
I heard that he sold his passport
and cannon phone to Jang Myung-jun.

840
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:40,963
- Yes.
- Yes.

841
00:55:55,796 --> 00:55:56,725
hey

842
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:58,438
who are we

843
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:02,197
Even when barbarians
attack, we'll stick together

844
00:56:02,198 --> 00:56:04,775
You are the Korean people who
overcame the national crisis, but

845
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:07,656
You can't be beaten by
an FBI bastard, can you?

846
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:10,033
What are you hiding from hyung?

847
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:11,243
huh?

848
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,707
I think Jang Myung-jun brought
a technician and produced drugs.

849
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,087
technician?

850
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:22,129
No, but why are you
talking about it now?

851
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,089
It's just a guess

852
00:56:25,205 --> 00:56:26,967
So many drugs
to give you a taste

853
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:28,962
Can't it be smuggled in easily?

854
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:30,978
right

855
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:33,298
If you set up that drug factory

856
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,439
So how many raw materials?

857
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:39,650
Senior, there was a chemical
theft case a week ago.

858
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:40,558
give me

859
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,482
Hey, what is benzylcyanide?

860
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:44,860
- Yes, this is the original cosmetic ingredient.
- Yeah

861
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,720
It can also be synthesized with heroin.

862
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:49,299
Security guard dies of cervical spine fracture

863
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:51,241
bastards do it

864
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,409
a stolen truck

865
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,870
The last trace I left was
the Yongin IC that morning.

866
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:55,760
- Yongin?
- Yes

867
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:57,414
Produce drugs in large quantities

868
00:56:57,596 --> 00:56:59,885
The poisonous gas and stench
would come out tremendously.

869
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,084
Hey Jonggu

870
00:57:02,103 --> 00:57:05,213
Abandoned factories or warehouses that are a
bit far from private houses, please list them

871
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,674
- Yes.
- We're going to Yongin.

872
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:08,510
Hey hey hey

873
00:57:08,712 --> 00:57:10,525
What do you and your daughter do together?

874
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:12,930
- Hey, Oduk-ah.
- Yes.

875
00:57:12,932 --> 00:57:14,765
you take it and
chase it fast, fast

876
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:15,939
Yes

877
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:22,105
cooperate

878
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:24,107
you can't see your family anymore

879
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:27,903
like a family to meet

880
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:30,385
no

881
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:03,642
Yes, sunbaenim, I've been guessing,
but there are about 300 suspicious places?

882
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:05,190
Too many?

883
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:08,026
Let's select only places that are more
than 500m away from private houses

884
00:58:08,237 --> 00:58:09,494
yes, guess

885
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,588
passed

886
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:49,089
I'll fall for you before I notice

887
00:59:59,628 --> 01:00:02,277
I'll keep chasing
the eagle here.

888
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,410
What, the FBI called?

889
01:00:19,434 --> 01:00:20,645
uh ok

890
01:00:21,152 --> 01:00:22,020
yes

891
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:25,580
I saw what the nerd found
out. What about all your fortune?

892
01:00:25,777 --> 01:00:27,707
- Sung.
- Uh, can you see something?

893
01:00:27,777 --> 01:00:29,954
The drone's battery is
dead. It's time for work.

894
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:31,082
Shall we withdraw?

895
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:32,457
Hey Oduk-ah

896
01:00:32,874 --> 01:00:34,422
- Man, just float it.
- Yeah.

897
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,715
battery excuses

898
01:00:35,848 --> 01:00:36,800
Wait a minute

899
01:00:37,246 --> 01:00:38,927
- It wasn't a stolen truck.
- Huh?

900
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,124
Hey, hey, a little closer,
a little closer, a little more

901
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,097
Yes

902
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:43,223
hey

903
01:00:43,966 --> 01:00:46,184
Let's go first before the
sun goes down, okay?

904
01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:56,382
Are you sure?

905
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:01,663
Hey, Rule 1 should be
lifted for a while, take it

906
01:01:02,695 --> 01:01:03,906
- And Oh Deok-ah - Yes

907
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:05,620
you are waiting here

908
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,581
It's been 10 minutes and
we still don't show up, right?

909
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:08,790
Shall I go to work?

910
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:11,936
-You have to request support, this baby
-yes

911
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:14,504
let's go

912
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:37,891
No, the ambulance is here...

913
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:44,079
Chief comrade!

914
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:28,383
Let's Go

915
01:02:35,494 --> 01:02:38,017
Is hospital food sweet?

916
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:40,267
Comrade Captain, you have escaped

917
01:02:40,268 --> 01:02:41,299
Where are you?

918
01:02:41,602 --> 01:02:44,462
Our comrade Kim Kwang-yong
Why is his tail so long?

919
01:02:47,009 --> 01:02:50,087
We leave no prisoners
behind, you know?

920
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:52,435
do the dishes neatly

921
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:56,033
I've been through a lot

922
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:04,243
Hey, hey, hey!  Bomb Boom!

923
01:03:04,244 --> 01:03:05,638
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

924
01:03:06,419 --> 01:03:07,266
Boom!

925
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,119
It was an honor to meet you

926
01:03:11,213 --> 01:03:12,869
I executed the order

927
01:04:16,589 --> 01:04:17,682
it's okay?

928
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:33,244
Is it all my fault?

929
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:35,471
You get hit over and over
again because you're stupid.

930
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:38,274
what are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing!

931
01:04:39,206 --> 01:04:41,001
Hey, why, huh?

932
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,487
Hey, the bomb exploded
and there was a riot in the yard

933
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:45,840
What are you doing
in other countries?

934
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:47,378
Can't you see that?

935
01:04:51,932 --> 01:04:53,143
hey follow me

936
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,628
Follow!

937
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:04,425
hey, disinfect

938
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,659
Cheol-ryeong, listen carefully.

939
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:15,010
Jack is so damn
listenable and carefree

940
01:05:15,354 --> 01:05:17,455
It's an emergency, now, but

941
01:05:17,682 --> 01:05:18,887
North and South America

942
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:21,459
What are the best
detectives doing right now?

943
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:22,823
huh?

944
01:05:23,362 --> 01:05:26,339
Man, in a way this
might sound funny

945
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:28,925
we are the avengers

946
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:32,429
Now Thanos is about
to snap his fingers.

947
01:05:32,572 --> 01:05:34,639
Iron Man and Captain America

948
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,975
Can I fight like this
just because I'm good?

949
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:39,727
a little bit of pride

950
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:43,042
Let's work together
internationally!

951
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:45,315
If there is any hidden information, it will be exposed.

952
01:05:45,728 --> 01:05:46,932
I'll forgive you all

953
01:05:46,933 --> 01:05:48,570
You don't know anything

954
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:52,574
hey jack

955
01:05:53,323 --> 01:05:56,327
You're all hospitalized. Who
do you want to work with?

956
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,537
and the iron spirit

957
01:05:57,685 --> 01:05:59,667
You, too, flew all the clues

958
01:05:59,932 --> 01:06:02,500
What the hell is this Jang Myung-joon?

959
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:12,346
what?

960
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,182
Do you two know each other?

961
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:19,800
Are you a liar?

962
01:06:22,839 --> 01:06:25,479
I used to be a respected
senior, but not now.

963
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:27,859
He is from an African guerrilla unit.

964
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,776
All subordinates are mercenaries

965
01:06:32,432 --> 01:06:33,495
you must i

966
01:06:33,496 --> 01:06:36,003
Hey, let's talk
about it right now

967
01:06:36,004 --> 01:06:37,877
- Are you talking about this?
- No, that...

968
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:39,930
Forgive me all.

969
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:44,250
ok ok, ok

970
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,284
Then why did you call the mercenaries?

971
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:50,924
money?

972
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:52,416
Two months ago

973
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:55,512
I got an email with
the ID Adolf Bohrman.

974
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:57,805
So he was able to catch Jang Myung-Jun

975
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:00,600
But I am Adolf Bohrmann

976
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,019
I think it's
Korean-American Michael Jo

977
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:04,300
Michael Joe...

978
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:07,070
money laundering?

979
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:11,945
Then the fact that Michael
Cho betrayed Myung-Jun Jang

980
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:15,409
That guy gulps Jang Myung-joon's money?

981
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:17,714
So Myung-Jun Jang is
looking for the money.

982
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:19,685
Did he summon mercenaries?

983
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:20,828
bingo

984
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:23,128
Why did you choose South Korea?

985
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:24,045
why did you go

986
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:27,115
Guddy there is a money book in
the south that manages $1 billion

987
01:07:27,116 --> 01:07:28,873
How the hell is that money?

988
01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:31,005
money isn't important

989
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:33,449
We need to stop it before
it causes a bigger accident.

990
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,412
'Cause there's no clue

991
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:42,392
I'll talk about one too.

992
01:07:43,513 --> 01:07:46,919
Actually, I have a cannon phone
confiscated by Kim Kwang-yong.

993
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,565
- That...
- Listen first.

994
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,435
I know the guy who
distributed it, Sergey

995
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:53,860
Sergei, if you catch the bastard

996
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,822
Find out Jang Myung-joon's number

997
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:58,116
That you can track
Myung-Jun Jang.

998
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,193
- You know what I'm talking about, huh?
- yep

999
01:08:00,646 --> 01:08:01,872
ok, ok

1000
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:03,310
one cup each

1001
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:08,710
Now, if we drink this,
we will cooperate.

1002
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:10,378
- Got it.
- Okay.

1003
01:08:14,037 --> 01:08:15,383
So good

1004
01:08:19,677 --> 01:08:21,681
I'll tell you about the old days

1005
01:08:24,419 --> 01:08:26,978
Was there a drama on TV
called Investigation Chief?

1006
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:31,691
The person who appears as the class leader
there is a person named Bul-Am Choi, huh?

1007
01:08:32,435 --> 01:08:36,270
Just wear a barbarian
coat and smoke a cigarette

1008
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:40,832
You were so cool, huh?

1009
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,435
But at that time, I
just looked very old.

1010
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:50,974
All of a sudden
I'm that old, savage

1011
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:53,516
Jintae, Jintae, stop drinking.

1012
01:08:53,598 --> 01:08:56,382
What does Jintae mean to you?

1013
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,051
I have to say respect, that...

1014
01:08:58,693 --> 01:09:00,011
castle try it, castle

1015
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,638
I don't know about respect

1016
01:09:01,754 --> 01:09:03,222
There is no such thing as a foreigner

1017
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:04,372
all friends

1018
01:09:04,785 --> 01:09:05,443
uh?

1019
01:09:07,193 --> 01:09:08,144
Wait a minute

1020
01:09:09,802 --> 01:09:11,068
how old are you

1021
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:13,691
uh?  I am 82

1022
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:15,162
fast 82

1023
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,823
Hardy the American way, what

1024
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:24,202
Hey, am I your brother?

1025
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:27,330
Do you think the
previous one is better?

1026
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:28,419
okay?

1027
01:09:30,091 --> 01:09:32,129
- Hey, do you like Cheol-ryeong that much?
- uh

1028
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,380
I just saw Cheol-ryeong
in a slow video like this

1029
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:37,590
Was your sister like that when you first saw your brother-in-law?

1030
01:09:37,848 --> 01:09:39,592
I don't know, I don't even remember

1031
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,326
Dad said he was all
over the house now

1032
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:42,247
what?

1033
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:44,317
No no no no no no no no

1034
01:09:44,318 --> 01:09:45,583
- No, no, no now.
- Did you come quickly?

1035
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:46,724
Here, can you tidy up here?

1036
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:47,872
- No.
- Really...

1037
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:50,927
Take this and follow me

1038
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,942
No, what is it doing?

1039
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:03,333
why?

1040
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:07,981
I heard it backwards, it should be like this

1041
01:10:07,982 --> 01:10:09,330
- Okay, hurry up, go fast.
- Fight.

1042
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,373
- Go fast.
- Fight.

1043
01:10:26,294 --> 01:10:28,091
Cheol-ryeong, are you hurt, where are you?

1044
01:10:28,364 --> 01:10:29,392
no work

1045
01:10:29,794 --> 01:10:31,269
come and sit here

1046
01:10:35,427 --> 01:10:36,576
look where

1047
01:10:57,408 --> 01:10:58,557
How r u?

1048
01:10:58,924 --> 01:11:00,923
Fine, thanks and you?

1049
01:11:01,142 --> 01:11:02,341
Bare Dan Now

1050
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:04,251
Honey, why is your
face curly again?

1051
01:11:04,253 --> 01:11:06,472
We had volunteer
work as a group today.

1052
01:11:07,046 --> 01:11:09,015
this is jack

1053
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:11,829
It's the FBI, the FBI uh, uh

1054
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,239
my wife

1055
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,188
- Daughter, Sister
- Nice to Meet You

1056
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:17,650
- Hi, nice to meet you

1057
01:11:18,618 --> 01:11:21,535
You speak Korean very well

1058
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:26,408
I heard that there are
many beauties in Korea.

1059
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:28,236
it's true

1060
01:11:29,627 --> 01:11:30,369
look at this

1061
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,588
I said no respect and
where did Jill wink?

1062
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,818
- Yes
- but a little

1063
01:11:33,818 --> 01:11:35,641
- I think you should wash.
- That's right.

1064
01:11:35,978 --> 01:11:37,181
Daddy's clothes, daddy's clothes

1065
01:11:37,182 --> 01:11:38,478
- Guess I'll have to
give you a big one.

1066
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:39,564
- Showers, showers
- Yeah, once upon a time

1067
01:11:39,565 --> 01:11:41,634
I should change into the
clothes my father wore.

1068
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:42,923
- toilet, toilet
- ok

1069
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,884
- Sister, I, I'll take it.
- Mom, I'll look for dad's clothes.

1070
01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:46,743
- Honey.
- No, I threw it all away.

1071
01:11:46,744 --> 01:11:47,900
Where did you put it?

1072
01:11:47,901 --> 01:11:49,618
- Shower.
- I didn't throw it away.

1073
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:50,923
where are you, honey

1074
01:11:50,924 --> 01:11:52,600
Honey, you know that
stripe like this on a tee

1075
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:54,601
Didn't you see that line going in?

1076
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:56,517
okay, why?

1077
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:59,243
It was hard, even if it wasn't

1078
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:00,733
not a single woman

1079
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:02,259
it's ok, it's ok

1080
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:37,114
America knows how
to manage money

1081
01:12:37,324 --> 01:12:39,582
When America
smells money, it's over

1082
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:40,661
hurry up

1083
01:12:40,663 --> 01:12:42,880
We need to get the money back first

1084
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:46,070
And don't trust the South
Korean detective too much.

1085
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,332
Because we are of Korean people, after
all, we are one with the United States.

1086
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:50,684
I got it

1087
01:12:51,028 --> 01:12:53,145
I think they both noticed?

1088
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:56,581
Detective Kang Jin-tae?

1089
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,084
Well, that's the teacher, what

1090
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,754
Who am I?

1091
01:13:03,965 --> 01:13:06,132
I'm sober

1092
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:09,719
Cheol-ryeong and Jack this bastard
is drinking and teasing me now.

1093
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,457
It's very lax than it looks

1094
01:13:12,692 --> 01:13:15,168
but our house
Not Airbnb.

1095
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:16,832
This is the price of rice

1096
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:18,957
later this
Do I have to process all receipts?

1097
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,738
The price of food is a problem now, huh?

1098
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:22,921
Wake
that you are the national team

1099
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:25,839
right, and
There's a guy called Michael Jo

1100
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,528
check him out

1101
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,112
- Michael Joe?
- That bastard

1102
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,158
I think Jang
Myung-joon stole money.

1103
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,452
I don't want to, so I'll try
to get my money back.

1104
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,079
It looks like they're attacking
me. Take my men with me, huh?

1105
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:38,831
- Okay, okay, Michael Jo.
- Okay?

1106
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:39,999
yes, yes, yes

1107
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:42,801
Here, this, this,
change into this

1108
01:13:42,903 --> 01:13:43,794
- ok
- change

1109
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,046
Why, why, why, why, why?

1110
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,707
Yes, okay, I know
that, so I stop

1111
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,007
Hey, hey, Jintae, you...

1112
01:13:48,497 --> 01:13:49,675
already hung up

1113
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:50,718
are you hurt?

1114
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:52,328
- wound?  where?
- You must have been very sick.

1115
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,487
- where?  where?
- It's huge.

1116
01:13:53,487 --> 01:13:54,972
- this?
- Look.

1117
01:13:55,254 --> 01:13:58,254
This is the wound I got from
fighting the Russian mafia.

1118
01:13:58,255 --> 01:14:00,993
- Russian Mafia
- Too unrealistic

1119
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:03,183
Behind it, so big

1120
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:10,742
what should we do

1121
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:12,782
- It's so cool.
- It's really cool.

1122
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:16,318
Where are you bastards
proud of having a rough scratch?

1123
01:14:17,928 --> 01:14:19,242
in our north

1124
01:14:19,243 --> 01:14:22,458
Red pills are a waste in this
place, roughly miso or bardi

1125
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,060
Is this nothing?

1126
01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:26,435
- They're hanging out, what a wound.
- Cool, Mr. Cheol-ryeong.

1127
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:27,575
it was a long time ago

1128
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:30,998
I'm going to arrest a cow thief
and I'm just going to handcuff it.

1129
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:33,102
- What's flashing all of a sudden?
- What, what?

1130
01:14:33,148 --> 01:14:33,975
I just saw

1131
01:14:34,021 --> 01:14:36,389
The calf murmured,

1132
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,123
I just ran into you again, so I

1133
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:40,559
- No, Dad, really, really?
- Stretched out, on the spot

1134
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,537
It's real, I got real scars here

1135
01:14:42,538 --> 01:14:44,740
- It's true, I...
- Hey, hey, hey

1136
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,162
Dad, don't

1137
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:47,087
- Really?
- No, really...

1138
01:14:48,419 --> 01:14:49,717
Did you defuse the bomb?

1139
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:50,708
- bomb?
- bomb?

1140
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:52,933
I worked in the bomb
squad for 3 years?

1141
01:14:53,404 --> 01:14:54,803
- Aren't you scared?
- I wasn't scared.

1142
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,677
- Hey, hey, Jack, Jack, Jack
- It's a bomb.

1143
01:14:56,677 --> 01:14:57,523
Jack, Jack!

1144
01:14:57,731 --> 01:15:00,620
I was in the bomb squad too.
I went to a college meeting.

1145
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,216
That's why I was living
with that bomb then and now

1146
01:15:03,217 --> 01:15:06,529
- My wife, the bomb.
- You gave me a big laugh, huh?

1147
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:08,963
hey hey

1148
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:24,388
Bon appetite

1149
01:15:25,975 --> 01:15:26,939
thank you

1150
01:15:27,365 --> 01:15:28,899
I have to unpack

1151
01:15:29,123 --> 01:15:30,776
Can Cheol-ryeong also give me some coffee?

1152
01:15:31,404 --> 01:15:32,570
no work

1153
01:15:33,771 --> 01:15:35,881
What's the best thing about being bitter...

1154
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:40,686
thank you

1155
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:44,568
brother-in-law

1156
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,537
do you have an eye disease?

1157
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:53,685
Kiburidi Malau

1158
01:16:07,115 --> 01:16:11,108
Yes, I scoured all social media
and found traces of Sergei.

1159
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:13,611
Natasha is a Russian model.

1160
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,863
It is believed to be
Sergei's girlfriend.

1161
01:16:17,396 --> 01:16:19,186
'Cause we'll go into Natasha's undercover

1162
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:21,285
You know a little bit
more about Michael Joe

1163
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:22,350
- Let's go.
- Did you hear that?

1164
01:16:22,428 --> 01:16:23,974
We play Michael Cho

1165
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:47,561
Did Sergei show
up in three days?

1166
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,357
I hope so, what

1167
01:17:05,607 --> 01:17:08,326
I need to plant a
wiretap, but I'll return it.

1168
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:11,669
Why aren't you going out, huh?

1169
01:17:22,061 --> 01:17:24,615
Hey, how did you know
about this place, huh?

1170
01:17:24,637 --> 01:17:26,568
I asked the table manager

1171
01:17:26,569 --> 01:17:28,107
Really great honesty

1172
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:41,991
hey, hey, go out, go out

1173
01:17:42,099 --> 01:17:44,162
I'm just sitting still, what
are you going to eat now...

1174
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,705
Hey, I'm going to
plant that blueberry

1175
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:48,982
I can't leave Natasha alone.

1176
01:17:48,983 --> 01:17:50,916
Someone needs to follow
me, what should I do?

1177
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,396
follow me

1178
01:17:52,398 --> 01:17:53,884
Hey, are you bouncing a bit?

1179
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:56,529
- Then I'll go.

1180
01:17:57,850 --> 01:17:59,842
Then I will go with
Mr. Cheol-ryeong.

1181
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,912
Wouldn't it be okay if we
disguised ourselves as a couple?

1182
01:18:01,912 --> 01:18:02,928
couple?

1183
01:18:04,271 --> 01:18:06,935
Yeah, yeah, that's what
I do, but don't be shy

1184
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:08,468
- Okay.
- Okay.

1185
01:18:08,692 --> 01:18:10,131
Jack take a look here.

1186
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:12,563
- I go first.
- Be careful.

1187
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:13,670
oops

1188
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:55,272
this is very exciting

1189
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:57,500
Police work is
always so thrilling...

1190
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:06,742
Am I good at acting?

1191
01:19:07,023 --> 01:19:09,370
Is my undercover
perfect for my aptitude?

1192
01:19:11,633 --> 01:19:14,594
Isn't it strange
to buy two each?

1193
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:21,771
no way...

1194
01:19:47,071 --> 01:19:47,700
are you again?

1195
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:50,164
This baby, where I was
there, was stuck here

1196
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:56,208
castle!

1197
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:01,665
uh

1198
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:06,719
Well
I don't know, I don't know!

1199
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,032
why don't you know

1200
01:20:08,033 --> 01:20:11,765
To Jang Myung-joon, you
You sold a cannon phone

1201
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:14,639
let's finish it fast
please tell me your number

1202
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,757
what's the number

1203
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:17,688
Call me a lawyer here.
lawyer!

1204
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:20,441
What is the global hogu in Korea?
For a Soviet guy like you

1205
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,311
Get a lawyer for your taxes
is this kid?

1206
01:20:22,312 --> 01:20:24,611
That's why I'm
sitting in this country

1207
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,654
looks like russia

1208
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,626
Already in electric torture,
direct to Siberian prison

1209
01:20:29,227 --> 01:20:32,618
This country really has the best human rights

1210
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,055
you send me to real siberia

1211
01:20:39,056 --> 01:20:42,296
I knew this would happen, and I posted a
notice of cooperation in advance, didn't I?

1212
01:20:42,492 --> 01:20:45,430
You know it's two hours by
plane from Vladivostok, right?

1213
01:20:46,954 --> 01:20:47,954
are you scared

1214
01:20:53,563 --> 01:20:54,563
hey man

1215
01:20:59,212 --> 01:21:02,767
Rusky officials are so lazy

1216
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:05,038
You know the Zootopia sloth?

1217
01:21:06,115 --> 01:21:10,902
Ser...

1218
01:21:10,902 --> 01:21:14,370
gay

1219
01:21:15,149 --> 01:21:15,913
what?

1220
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:17,993
No, I want you to call
me right in front of you...

1221
01:21:24,977 --> 01:21:26,507
Uh, Detective Seo, why, why?

1222
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:28,907
- You want me to call you?
- uh

1223
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:32,513
already?
did you arrive at the airport?

1224
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:33,797
what airport?

1225
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:35,349
You're coming this way right?

1226
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,875
No, no, don't do that,
just rest and come.

1227
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:39,686
No, what the hell are you talking about?

1228
01:21:39,796 --> 01:21:42,523
Tomorrow you're going straight
to Vladivostok with this bastard?

1229
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,900
No, I'm here

1230
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:48,132
Go to Hanok Village, go to
Gwangjang Market, eat drug gimbap

1231
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:49,530
I tell you to rest

1232
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,117
Okay, okay, then
come on. Yeah, uh

1233
01:21:56,095 --> 01:21:57,496
It's Carl, it's Carl.

1234
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,623
hey

1235
01:21:59,907 --> 01:22:03,282
What about your pretty girlfriend
if you get caught, Natasha?

1236
01:22:03,656 --> 01:22:04,483
uh?

1237
01:22:09,234 --> 01:22:10,509
ugly bastard, that

1238
01:22:10,595 --> 01:22:12,283
What about the Russian detective?

1239
01:22:12,415 --> 01:22:15,764
Hey, there are North and South Korea and there is the
United States, but it would be sad if Russia was missing.

1240
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:18,579
Jack, you used to
be a Russian Mafia.

1241
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,266
Did I mention that you've ever been stuck?

1242
01:22:21,923 --> 01:22:22,884
you...

1243
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:26,108
no

1244
01:22:27,204 --> 01:22:28,527
- Yes
- No, no

1245
01:22:28,626 --> 01:22:30,985
- Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes
- No, No, No, No, No, No

1246
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,493
no

1247
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:01,040
russian

1248
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,719
Well, I only know flirting
with girls and cursing.

1249
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,095
It's enough

1250
01:23:05,454 --> 01:23:06,315
hey

1251
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:09,462
Anyway, shouldn't we have
to catch Myung-Jun Jang?

1252
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:10,657
uh?

1253
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:13,071
OK

1254
01:23:13,548 --> 01:23:15,360
come on, come on, come on

1255
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,634
I'm annoyed

1256
01:23:21,306 --> 01:23:25,376
The thought of sending you
to Siberia breaks my heart.

1257
01:23:25,602 --> 01:23:26,460
hey

1258
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:30,509
You know what it's like to a guy
like you in a prison full of men?

1259
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:33,892
Tarkovsky!

1260
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:57,688
Why don't we spend the night
together, you kinky bastard?

1261
01:24:05,836 --> 01:24:06,837
restroom?

1262
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,503
The bathroom, the bathroom!

1263
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:11,164
Find the bathroom, the bathroom!

1264
01:24:11,352 --> 01:24:12,699
You're looking for the bathroom.

1265
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:14,550
that bastard, that

1266
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:16,675
That baby shit

1267
01:24:17,602 --> 01:24:18,751
Bro bro

1268
01:24:18,906 --> 01:24:19,911
- Hey, what's your brother, nigga?
- Save me.

1269
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:21,807
- I need a title to help you
- That bastard is a complete psycho.

1270
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:22,735
010!

1271
01:24:22,736 --> 01:24:24,274
- What?
- 6742!

1272
01:24:24,275 --> 01:24:25,852
Hey, hey, hey, nigga, take it here

1273
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:39,079
start

1274
01:24:51,641 --> 01:24:53,463
Do you really need to do this?

1275
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:56,844
How does your heart get softer?

1276
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,229
I'm not giddy

1277
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:01,680
Even innocent people...

1278
01:25:07,094 --> 01:25:11,095
Did our Comrade
Kim's family die for sin?

1279
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:14,461
I have to pay you back

1280
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:18,821
Guilty

1281
01:25:26,165 --> 01:25:28,832
The North Korean delegation for
the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks

1282
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,497
Arrived through
Panmunjom this afternoon

1283
01:25:31,498 --> 01:25:34,075
This conference, which will be
held for two days and one night,

1284
01:25:34,076 --> 01:25:38,634
Kim Jong-taek, 5th in the ranking of power, a member
of the Central Military Commission of the Party

1285
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:41,692
Great progress is
expected in negotiations

1286
01:25:47,536 --> 01:25:49,770
- Come in.
- I'll go.

1287
01:25:50,668 --> 01:25:52,314
Cannon phone location is up

1288
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:54,028
- Is it?
- traveling by vehicle

1289
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:55,856
In the direction of Yeongdongdaegyo Bridge, Olympic Boulevard

1290
01:25:55,872 --> 01:25:57,319
Hey, where are these kids going?

1291
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,196
Base station access log

1292
01:25:59,513 --> 01:26:01,448
But Jang Myung-joon and his crew a few days ago

1293
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:04,161
Visited a club owned
by Michael Cho

1294
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:05,645
Cheongdam-dong Chroma

1295
01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:06,942
chroma?

1296
01:26:06,943 --> 01:26:09,623
Myung-Jun Jang goes to Michael Cho

1297
01:26:10,286 --> 01:26:12,292
- Okay, okay.
- Hey, hey, hey, Jintae.

1298
01:26:12,395 --> 01:26:15,837
We don't have a warrant, we don't have any evidence,
but we got our necks off after touching the wrong thing

1299
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:17,214
am i stupid

1300
01:26:17,536 --> 01:26:21,200
If you go in pretending to be a guest, and when Jang
Myung-joon shows up, you will be caught as a current criminal.

1301
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,428
Brother, haven't you been to the club?

1302
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,263
VIPs play in the room so
you can't tell from the outside

1303
01:26:26,263 --> 01:26:27,310
- okay?
- yes

1304
01:26:29,129 --> 01:26:31,786
- So what do you do, without a warrant?
- So not now.

1305
01:26:33,842 --> 01:26:37,458
Well, there are ways to
search without a warrant.

1306
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:38,505
what?

1307
01:26:38,614 --> 01:26:40,872
I'm the club bamboo shooter, no...

1308
01:26:42,216 --> 01:26:44,591
As an experienced club member,

1309
01:26:44,592 --> 01:26:46,592
What if I go to the club?

1310
01:26:46,593 --> 01:26:50,038
Is it that men naturally
entangled and booking came in?

1311
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,411
in this room, in that room

1312
01:26:52,075 --> 01:26:53,709
When I was young again, I

1313
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,497
Doesn't that mean that
all rooms are equal?

1314
01:26:56,497 --> 01:26:57,474
so?

1315
01:26:57,668 --> 01:27:00,549
It's a walking search warrant, I

1316
01:27:24,704 --> 01:27:25,866
be careful

1317
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,216
The problem went
away like a bullet.

1318
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,165
like a bullet?

1319
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:34,833
Slower than bullets...

1320
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:35,915
I see

1321
01:27:37,064 --> 01:27:40,345
Now, let's get the warrant enforced.

1322
01:27:54,961 --> 01:27:57,022
yes ace confirmed

1323
01:28:18,407 --> 01:28:19,594
hello

1324
01:28:41,937 --> 01:28:43,902
South Korean machines are good, hey

1325
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,476
a lot of people gathered

1326
01:28:45,882 --> 01:28:47,155
Do you have a meeting today?

1327
01:28:48,913 --> 01:28:50,476
What's so funny?

1328
01:28:53,046 --> 01:28:54,960
i've been thinking

1329
01:28:57,062 --> 01:28:59,042
Here's a billion dollars

1330
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:02,087
If only one person left
this out, it was all mine.

1331
01:29:02,554 --> 01:29:03,672
What do you want to say?

1332
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,257
That's how I'm doing business

1333
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:08,280
Why are you all of a sudden saying
you're withdrawing money, geez?

1334
01:29:08,365 --> 01:29:10,326
Anyway, you're on the run

1335
01:29:10,608 --> 01:29:12,138
I can't even give you this

1336
01:29:14,476 --> 01:29:16,935
Five million bucks would be
a bummer in the Philippines

1337
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:18,890
I'll take care of your living expenses.

1338
01:29:18,891 --> 01:29:20,639
Think you're going to farm

1339
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:24,484
The conversation is so cool, man

1340
01:29:25,108 --> 01:29:25,913
okay

1341
01:29:27,202 --> 01:29:31,304
Then take a sip of my
drink and think about it, well

1342
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:32,826
huh?

1343
01:29:35,702 --> 01:29:37,499
Bring me a Mansour set

1344
01:30:01,803 --> 01:30:03,828
Is your seat okay?
Shall we change?

1345
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:21,917
- Jintae
- Why?

1346
01:30:22,088 --> 01:30:24,995
Cheol-ryeong has
something to hide from us

1347
01:30:24,996 --> 01:30:27,088
- What are you hiding?
- Jang Myung-Jun's money

1348
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,590
The drug money, $1 billion

1349
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:30,800
- You're here to find it.
- A billion dollars?

1350
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,246
Why are you talking about that now?

1351
01:30:32,247 --> 01:30:35,138
No, he wants both Jang
Myung-jun and money.

1352
01:30:35,364 --> 01:30:37,459
Then we'll be fools

1353
01:30:40,427 --> 01:30:41,763
you get your money

1354
01:30:45,514 --> 01:30:46,816
What is this?

1355
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,402
How much is one billion dollars?

1356
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:51,696
One billion dollars is
10 billion, 100 billion...

1357
01:30:53,334 --> 01:30:54,537
Is it Joe 1?

1358
01:30:55,996 --> 01:30:56,910
10, wait...

1359
01:30:57,154 --> 01:30:58,328
Hey, you bastard!

1360
01:30:58,529 --> 01:31:00,997
I'm dying because I don't have enough
hands. I'm just kidding around here.

1361
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,791
Let's go to the kitchen now!

1362
01:31:02,946 --> 01:31:06,045
I got the boss VIP in the penthouse
and went out with the Mansour set.

1363
01:31:07,404 --> 01:31:08,546
yes sorry

1364
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:11,060
Boss, yes, VIP yes, yes, yes

1365
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:15,342
hello

1366
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:17,180
uh, head of the table

1367
01:31:19,071 --> 01:31:21,071
I found out about North Korea's plot.

1368
01:31:21,072 --> 01:31:22,084
what is that?

1369
01:31:36,302 --> 01:31:38,946
I'll take care of you
until I omit my crumbs.

1370
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:41,830
But I can't understand
your young topic

1371
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:43,361
It is not important to understand the topic

1372
01:31:43,362 --> 01:31:46,000
It's important to understand the
atmosphere right now, you bastard

1373
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,915
Do you still think
I'm your asshole?

1374
01:31:49,822 --> 01:31:53,314
It's an expensive drink,
but you have to taste it.

1375
01:32:20,829 --> 01:32:21,993
Help me

1376
01:32:23,814 --> 01:32:27,384
Isn't money one
thing with drugs?

1377
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:29,437
I'm starting to eat.

1378
01:32:29,438 --> 01:32:31,629
You have to look for it to end

1379
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:33,757
I feel sorry for your daughter

1380
01:32:35,056 --> 01:32:35,947
stop

1381
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:37,969
Stop it, Comrade Zhang.

1382
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,572
She got her money
too, so stop...

1383
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,845
You bastard like a tiger horse!

1384
01:32:42,336 --> 01:32:44,595
Did you think I didn't know
that you spyed on the FBI?

1385
01:32:44,596 --> 01:32:45,680
Comrade Jang

1386
01:32:46,165 --> 01:32:47,978
we've come too far

1387
01:32:48,673 --> 01:32:49,731
before it's too late...

1388
01:33:05,548 --> 01:33:07,978
uh?  Myung-Jun Jang is in the penthouse.

1389
01:33:08,353 --> 01:33:09,368
Min Young

1390
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:10,986
go home now

1391
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,769
- Jack.
- Why?

1392
01:33:28,009 --> 01:33:29,244
Hey, hey!

1393
01:33:30,743 --> 01:33:31,727
hey!

1394
01:33:32,329 --> 01:33:33,274
sorry

1395
01:33:34,056 --> 01:33:34,824
hey!

1396
01:34:00,611 --> 01:34:04,102
I am Adol, Adolf Bohrmann

1397
01:34:04,892 --> 01:34:06,307
stop, stop

1398
01:34:07,853 --> 01:34:09,102
Crash, slaughter...

1399
01:34:10,243 --> 01:34:11,220
let's go

1400
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:27,790
Hurry in, get in, get in!

1401
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:30,313
Enter!
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

1402
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,495
Cheoryeong-ah

1403
01:35:37,597 --> 01:35:38,683
go over there

1404
01:35:41,698 --> 01:35:43,127
What, why?

1405
01:35:43,128 --> 01:35:44,572
Sung, I'm sorry

1406
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:47,120
Hey, hey!

1407
01:35:47,393 --> 01:35:48,971
Hey, Im Cheol-ryeong!

1408
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:31,526
Lim Cheol-ryeong, Lieutenant of Social
Security, Democratic People's Republic of Korea

1409
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:33,698
According to the agreement between the North and the South

1410
01:36:34,214 --> 01:36:36,252
North Korean delegation
requesting extradition

1411
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:41,686
I drank water again.

1412
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:43,089
Look, huh?

1413
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:45,784
Surely I said I had other plans?

1414
01:36:45,785 --> 01:36:48,803
But I can't figure it out, huh?
In the end, make this four months?

1415
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:51,987
No, I found it, but isn't
it just that I'm late there?

1416
01:36:51,987 --> 01:36:54,183
It's like a billion dollars

1417
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,550
Does Jintae or Nana have
to take off their clothes?

1418
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:58,896
Why do I take my clothes off?

1419
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:03,011
Then you take responsibility
and bring back 1 billion dollars!

1420
01:37:03,394 --> 01:37:04,986
senior, senior

1421
01:37:05,933 --> 01:37:09,532
The vehicle that Jang Myung-jun and his crew
were riding was found near Pyeongtaek Port.

1422
01:37:09,986 --> 01:37:11,971
Looks like you're trying to smuggle into China?

1423
01:37:14,401 --> 01:37:16,135
'Cause we'll do the dishes

1424
01:37:16,136 --> 01:37:18,284
He will make a comeback
home by plane tomorrow.

1425
01:37:18,285 --> 01:37:20,081
Detective Kang Jin-tae, go home and rest.

1426
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:22,917
I'm just going to make
you rest well this time.

1427
01:37:23,042 --> 01:37:25,370
Is this only the price
you risked your life for?

1428
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,386
Yes?

1429
01:37:28,049 --> 01:37:30,003
I will follow you to Pyeongtaek.

1430
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,930
Hey, if you don't understand
the topic, don't talk about it

1431
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,807
Detective Kang's house
monitoring device, go and collect it.

1432
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:35,964
A surveillance device?

1433
01:37:36,276 --> 01:37:38,478
Did you think we
would trust Jintae?

1434
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,645
Are you naive, what are you?

1435
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,018
So Im Cheol-ryeong
slaps me in the back

1436
01:37:42,019 --> 01:37:44,065
- Twice.
- Really...

1437
01:37:44,066 --> 01:37:45,362
- Hey, hey, hey
- What?

1438
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,370
No, what are you talking about...

1439
01:37:48,698 --> 01:37:49,862
really...

1440
01:38:07,268 --> 01:38:09,581
Good job, how about Kim Chul-soo?

1441
01:38:09,964 --> 01:38:11,065
he is dead

1442
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:13,846
All threats to the party
have been removed

1443
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:26,442
uh, are you here?

1444
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:30,363
This is Comrade Rim
Cheol-ryeong who closed this case.

1445
01:38:31,033 --> 01:38:33,905
Girae, you did a great job

1446
01:38:34,644 --> 01:38:36,394
Swiss bank security?

1447
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:50,745
Comrade is the hero of the party

1448
01:38:51,822 --> 01:38:54,120
He's gone to promise a big reward

1449
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,933
German chemist

1450
01:39:09,432 --> 01:39:12,155
Invention of poison gas that killed Jews

1451
01:39:13,355 --> 01:39:15,628
Adol, Adolf Bohrmann

1452
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:17,456
stop, stop

1453
01:39:18,722 --> 01:39:20,288
Crash, slaughter...

1454
01:39:34,143 --> 01:39:36,862
Customer is unable
to answer calls

1455
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:41,651
Today's high-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea
confirmed only the differences between the two sides.

1456
01:39:41,652 --> 01:39:43,948
It ended without the
adoption of an agreement

1457
01:39:43,949 --> 01:39:47,356
North Korean leader Kim Jong-taek, member
of the Party Central Military Commission,

1458
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:50,065
The U.S. came to the
meeting empty-handed.

1459
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,278
He strongly criticized the United States.

1460
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:54,956
The North Korean delegation will go
through Panmunjom tomorrow morning.

1461
01:39:54,957 --> 01:39:56,531
I'm going back to the north

1462
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:58,117
The informant is Kim Chul-soo.

1463
01:39:58,118 --> 01:39:59,893
Said he had to stop the
slaughter before he died

1464
01:39:59,894 --> 01:40:01,831
The name he used
was Adolf Bohrmann.

1465
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:04,424
German chemist who murdered Jews

1466
01:40:07,049 --> 01:40:08,339
unusual

1467
01:40:27,683 --> 01:40:28,870
I'm here

1468
01:40:34,269 --> 01:40:35,877
Hey, it's a little late

1469
01:41:11,395 --> 01:41:12,333
jack?

1470
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:15,919
jack?

1471
01:42:30,154 --> 01:42:32,146
How do you like this glory?

1472
01:42:33,107 --> 01:42:35,149
to catch a cub

1473
01:42:35,787 --> 01:42:38,584
Comrade Kim Jeong-taek
of Baekdu bloodline is here...

1474
01:42:47,764 --> 01:42:49,409
bastard baby

1475
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:52,193
snout is alive

1476
01:42:53,725 --> 01:42:57,963
I only believe in your words that you
need to earn dollars to feed the people.

1477
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:02,553
I threw away all my honor as a
soldier and acted as a drug dealer.

1478
01:43:02,834 --> 01:43:03,928
that money

1479
01:43:04,529 --> 01:43:07,295
I mean, it went through
the mouth of a bastard.

1480
01:43:09,107 --> 01:43:13,014
I'll close my eyes and do
whatever I ask you to do

1481
01:43:13,295 --> 01:43:15,248
Have a quick glance

1482
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:23,364
But why the hell was he caught?

1483
01:43:23,686 --> 01:43:25,795
- You mean he was caught on purpose?
- okay

1484
01:43:25,796 --> 01:43:28,536
And now they're
after Jintae's family

1485
01:43:28,662 --> 01:43:30,232
I will save my family

1486
01:43:30,233 --> 01:43:32,154
You are in charge of Jang Myung-joon

1487
01:43:42,295 --> 01:43:44,326
It's shit training, shit training

1488
01:43:46,147 --> 01:43:47,498

1489
01:43:47,499 --> 01:43:49,396

1490
01:43:49,397 --> 01:43:50,889
Yeah?  yes

1491
01:43:55,576 --> 01:43:58,459
Don't you want to work with the FBI?

1492
01:43:59,287 --> 01:44:00,272
really?

1493
01:44:01,177 --> 01:44:04,071
Mom, I'm so scared

1494
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:07,115
Yuna, don't worry

1495
01:44:08,134 --> 01:44:10,985
Daddy will come to our
rescue just like back then.

1496
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:12,162
it's okay

1497
01:44:12,468 --> 01:44:13,834
it's ok don't cry

1498
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:25,264
Please check your ID

1499
01:44:26,654 --> 01:44:28,552
This is Jintae Kang, the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

1500
01:44:36,177 --> 01:44:37,990
- Thanks for your cooperation.
- Yes.

1501
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:54,733
Let's eat rice!

1502
01:44:55,827 --> 01:44:56,710
rice?

1503
01:44:57,093 --> 01:44:58,772
no we don't want to eat

1504
01:44:58,773 --> 01:45:01,444
No, I'm just saying that
we can eat all of this.

1505
01:45:01,445 --> 01:45:02,296
- Hey.
- Why?

1506
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,811
Would you like some jjajangmyeon?

1507
01:45:03,812 --> 01:45:05,591
Hey, do you think it's
going through your throat?

1508
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:07,443
You have a collection of
Chinese restaurant stickers, huh?

1509
01:45:07,444 --> 01:45:10,030
How recklessly did you save
up to eat sweet and sour pork?

1510
01:45:10,031 --> 01:45:12,279
I should die wearing it, so
it's less embarrassing, huh?

1511
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,099
Ghosts that ate and died have a good color

1512
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,267
- I'm skinny.
- Hey!

1513
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:16,186
- Weight loss?

1517
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,366
- Quickly pick a menu, pick a menu!
- Can't you shut up?

1518
01:45:22,655 --> 01:45:24,069
Please forgive me
when he was young

1519
01:45:24,071 --> 01:45:26,835
I think it's because I got the
briquette gas wrong, I'm sorry

1520
01:45:29,178 --> 01:45:30,327

01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,767

1537
01:48:42,867 --> 01:48:45,477
Uh, we're fine. Jack saved me.

1538
01:48:45,598 --> 01:48:47,376
- Don't worry about us.

1547
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:23,320
Hey, you bastard,

this bastard

1551
01:49:36,788 --> 01:49:39,608
If you want to catch a tiger, you
have to enter the tiger's oyster.

1552
01:50:18,921 --> 01:50:21,990
To get you out of the republic

1553

But why did you kill
my innocent family?

1557
01:50:32,506 --> 01:50:35,546
Pursuing even to the end of
hell and tearing the enemy apart

1558
01:50:35,547 --> 01:50:38,343
Isn't that a husband and a father's job?

1559
01:50:38,452 --> 01:50:39,522
Ivorau

1560
01:50:41,023 --> 01:50:42,068

What do you mean?

1562
01:52:41,217 --> 01:52:42,794
What is poison gas?

1563
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:48,919
Click this and after 5 minutes

1564

Poison gas installed on the
roof will spread all over the place

1565
01:52:53,107 --> 01:52:56,603
All living things within a
3km radius will be destroyed.

1566
01:52:56,919 --> 01:52:57,927
How are you?

1567
01:52:58,873 --> 01:53:00,747
Isn't that a crazy operation kid?

1568

- I'm sorry yesterday.
- It's noisy.

1571
01:53:21,451 --> 01:53:23,052
Collaboration isn't over yet

They're trying to spray poison gas

1573
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,787
You're doing all the damn shit, really.

1574
01:53:31,615 --> 01:53:33,390
- Cover me.
- Huh?

1575
01:53:34,248 --> 01:53:35,849

1580
01:55:33,272 --> 01:55:37,686
You crossed two lines
that shouldn't be crossed

1581
01:55:37,896 --> 01:55:38,990
the first

1582
01:55:39,514 --> 01:55:42,394
The fact that you entered
the territory of Korea, second

1583
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:45,358
that you touched my family

1584
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:48,038
What are you going to do?
Weak bastard

1585
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:58,857
Cheol-ryeong, are you okay?

1586
01:57:00,529 --> 01:57:01,693
bomb?

1587
01:57:02,755 --> 01:57:04,216
- It's over there.
- Uh.

1588
01:57:06,169 --> 01:57:09,263
Are you going to kill
all the innocent people?

1589
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,670
Why are you not guilty?

1590
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,037
My daughter and
my wife died in a fire

1591
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:16,498
Even if South Korea only accepted asylum

1592
01:57:16,888 --> 01:57:19,107
my family didn't get killed

1593
01:57:19,809 --> 01:57:21,911
Now the South Korean bastards

1594
01:57:22,982 --> 01:57:25,021
Shouldn't it be a taste of hell?

1595
01:57:52,357 --> 01:57:53,864
- Uh, Jintae, why, why, why, why?
- jack

1596
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:56,152
Now look, it's a poison gas bomb

1597
01:57:56,153 --> 01:57:57,571
- Poison gas!
- What are you talking about

1598
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:58,697
Poison!

1599
01:57:58,698 --> 01:58:00,708
Honey, we're all
here here, there...

1600
01:58:01,544 --> 01:58:03,325
What if I come here?

1601
01:58:03,903 --> 01:58:04,863
I'll be delighted

1602
01:58:04,864 --> 01:58:07,455
Hey Jack, what do I do?
less than 3 minutes left

1603
01:58:07,548 --> 01:58:09,541
If we don't dismantle
this, we'll all die!

1604
01:58:09,622 --> 01:58:10,932
why are you asking me that

1605
01:58:11,302 --> 01:58:13,529
You said you were a bomb squad!

1606
01:58:18,379 --> 01:58:20,489
- Please help me.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1607
01:58:20,614 --> 01:58:22,053
what should we do

1608
01:58:22,841 --> 01:58:26,057
ok, hole, key to dismantle
the hole, key to dismantle

1609
01:58:26,216 --> 01:58:27,107
key?

1610
01:58:28,708 --> 01:58:30,943
key!  there, there!  uh!

1611
01:58:38,034 --> 01:58:39,255
- You can't come in here.
- No, wait.

1612
01:58:39,256 --> 01:58:40,841
- Jintae's family
- Hello

1613
01:58:41,451 --> 01:58:43,033
- Jesu, what are you doing here?
- Chief

1614
01:58:43,075 --> 01:58:44,707
Now our Yuna and
Dad are over there

1615
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:47,348
- Yes?
- No, there's a bomb on the roof.

1616
01:59:33,451 --> 01:59:34,404
Iron spirit!

1617
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:36,185
key!

1618
01:59:36,451 --> 01:59:39,162
I need to find the key
to defuse the bomb.

1619
01:59:42,193 --> 01:59:43,115
key

1620
01:59:43,896 --> 01:59:45,123
give it out

1621
01:59:51,255 --> 01:59:52,498
come now

1622
01:59:53,544 --> 01:59:54,935
my daughter

1623
01:59:55,677 --> 01:59:57,899
I'm going to go see my wife's face

1624
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,943
Cheoryeong-ah

1625
02:00:01,412 --> 02:00:03,669
that we never meet again

1626
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:05,591
would be nice

1627
02:00:09,990 --> 02:00:11,240
no!

1628
02:00:18,114 --> 02:00:18,980
what is that?

1629
02:00:27,373 --> 02:00:28,365
put the radio

1630
02:00:51,193 --> 02:00:52,370
uh huh?

1631
02:00:52,375 --> 02:00:53,646
take the key

1632
02:00:58,726 --> 02:01:01,054
- closer!
- One More

1633
02:01:01,258 --> 02:01:03,375
- Closer, more
- Closer!

1634
02:01:15,235 --> 02:01:16,876
Iron spirit!

1635
02:02:01,352 --> 02:02:02,357
castle

1636
02:02:03,961 --> 02:02:05,086
by the way...

1637
02:02:06,454 --> 02:02:08,047
How do you get into the house?

1638
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:11,641
We died to my brother-in-law

1639
02:02:16,273 --> 02:02:18,235
Hey, just get down on your knees, what

1640
02:02:21,532 --> 02:02:22,649
Hey Jack!

1641
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:30,281
Yeah im ok hey Jack,
thank you so much

1642
02:02:30,688 --> 02:02:32,883
- You said it was because you were the older brother, didn't you?
- uh?

1643
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:38,469
Not your brother, huh?

1644
02:02:39,922 --> 02:02:43,126
Hey, you only use English
when you're at a disadvantage

1645
02:02:52,524 --> 02:02:54,040
Hey, but how do I do this?

1646
02:02:55,265 --> 02:02:58,243
If you take it, will it be used to
solve the real food shortage?

1647
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:14,971
Did the chairperson go up?

1648
02:03:29,444 --> 02:03:32,813
Guess I'm crazy, that's
Minyoung-ah, see me, that slow video

1649
02:03:33,648 --> 02:03:35,241
- Awesome.
- Sister, can you see it?

1650
02:03:35,414 --> 02:03:36,460
- Great, I see.
- Huh?

1651
02:03:36,461 --> 02:03:40,363
Hey, what's wrong with
this, what's up, honey

1652
02:03:40,363 --> 02:03:41,581
Dad!

1653
02:03:41,719 --> 02:03:44,083
Honey, come quickly

1654
02:03:44,084 --> 02:03:46,750
Come on, you bastard, really...

1655
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:10,086
News that UNICEF is going to provide
$1 billion in food aid to North Korea

1656
02:04:10,087 --> 02:04:12,531
People who donated $1 billion

1657
02:04:12,532 --> 02:04:15,365
Attention is focused on
the source of the funds.

1658
02:04:15,366 --> 02:04:19,805
However, UNICEF decided not to disclose the identity
of the donor according to the wishes of the donor.

1659
02:04:24,594 --> 02:04:26,751
Sung, I'm sorry

1660
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:27,889
what?

1661
02:04:28,078 --> 02:04:29,993
I can't even get a promotion because of me.

1662
02:04:31,438 --> 02:04:34,759
Man, I didn't even want a promotion,
I'm just glad I didn't get cut, well

1663
02:04:34,868 --> 02:04:37,547
but that's a really good idea

1664
02:04:38,415 --> 02:04:40,664
I'll live like this again, well

1665
02:04:42,273 --> 02:04:43,618
Goodbye

1666
02:04:45,797 --> 02:04:46,930
good luck

1667
02:04:53,495 --> 02:04:55,808
Cheol-ryeong, I'll wait

1668
02:04:55,930 --> 02:04:57,195
Wait?

1669
02:04:57,196 --> 02:04:58,992

1670
02:04:59,516 --> 02:05:00,827
i really...

1671
02:05:11,164 --> 02:05:13,993
Minyoung, have you
ever been to the US?

1672
02:05:14,508 --> 02:05:15,485
no

1673
02:05:15,993 --> 02:05:17,468
when i go to usa

1674
02:05:18,547 --> 02:05:19,721
Wanna go on a trip together?

1675
02:05:20,117 --> 02:05:21,789
- Really?
- yes

1676
02:05:23,235 --> 02:05:24,434

1677
02:05:25,313 --> 02:05:26,329

1678
02:05:29,047 --> 02:05:30,063

1679
02:05:31,321 --> 02:05:32,282
hey

1680
02:05:32,774 --> 02:05:34,321
don't be silly

1681
02:05:41,711 --> 02:05:42,922
It's mine?

1682
02:05:50,961 --> 02:05:52,742
Thank you, Mr. Cheol-ryeong

1683
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,508
I'll wait

1684
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:59,258
Hey, you're a Cheol-ryeong...

1685
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:02,323
sister!

1686
02:06:02,323 --> 02:06:03,715
what's up with this

1687
02:06:03,717 --> 02:06:05,961
There is really no tree
that can't be taken ten times.

1688
02:06:05,962 --> 02:06:08,807
- Don't touch it.
- Look, hey, congratulations, congratulations.
