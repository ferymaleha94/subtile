Congratulations.

13
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,875
You have been accepted to
take
part in The Sleep Experiment.

14
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,208
This experiment is being
conducted for research
purposes.

15
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,958
If you comply with the
following
requirements all charges

16
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,458
currently held against you
will
be dropped and you will be

17
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,375
automatically released
from your prison
sentence.

00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,417
RICK:
You must stay awake
for the next 30 days.

20
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,625
You must complete all
physical activities.

21
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,250
You must obey any orders
given to you without
delay.

22
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,708
Strictly no physical
contact between each
other.

23
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:55,458
Failure to cooperate will
result
in you returning to prison immediately.

24
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,750
30 days of food and
supply are included.

25
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,875
We have given each of you
a
diary, so that we can monitor

26
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,792
your thoughts and
feelings.

27
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,167
We will be testing an
experimental gas that will
be

28
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,042
administered to you to
prevent
you from falling asleep.

Is this the property of

CHRISTOPHER:
Yes.

00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,833
I'm Christopher Sampson.

DAVID:
I'm Inspector David Mac Lowe.

38
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,208
Do you mind if I come in
for a chat?

40
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:13,292
We tried to call,
but there was no response.

41
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,917
CHRISTOPHER:
Sorry about that.

42
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,333
I was out of town recently.

No. No.

46
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,958
Just clearing out
some old stuff.

47
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:30,792
Shall we?

48
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,625
Christopher, I believe you used
to work for the Porton

49
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,208
Down Chemical Defence
Establishment?

50
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,667
CHRISTOPHER:
I did, yes.

51
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,875
But that's a long time ago.

52
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,667
DAVID:
You were aware
of the investigation?

53
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,208
No, I'm not aware of any
investigation.

54
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,833
DAVID:
Really?

55
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,958
It's been in the
papers all week.

56
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,292
I thought you of all
people would have known.

57
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:55,917
Top secret documents on the
human experiments were leaked

58
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,083
to the papers.

59
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,083
Really?

60
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,167
Christopher, you wouldn't mind
coming down to the police
station

61
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,917
and answering a
few questions, would you?

62
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,708
Alright, Christopher,
thanks for coming down.

63
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm sure you have better
things to be doing today.

64
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,917
My name is Inspector
Robert Scott.

65
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,375
We wanna ask you a few questions
about one experiment

66
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,292
in particular that you worked
on.

67
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,500
The Sleep Experiment.

68
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,250
ROBERT:
We're trying to understand
why it went so horribly wrong.

69
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,083
We have the original recordings
of the experiments.

70
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,792
And what we're gonna do,
is we're gonna break it down

71
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,500
into small sections.

72
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,417
We're gonna ask you a few
questions
and we'd like you to answer them honestly.

73
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,333
We'll start with Day 1.

74
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:49,333

75
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,958
Look at the state of this place.

76
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,792
It's not
much, but it will do.

77
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,583
I thought we'd have things
to do, you know,

78
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,458
to keep us occupied?

79
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,125
Are we meant to just read
books for the next 30 days?

80
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,542
Just think yourself
lucky you're in here and not in
prison.

81
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,958
SEAN:
I suppose you're right.

82
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,333
And there are a lot
of books, and a deck of cards.

83
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,042
I mean, we're bound
to be kept occupied.

84
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,125
EDWARD:
Anybody hungry?

85
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,417
SEAN:
Yeah, I'm starving.

86
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,417
Throw us a piece of
bread here, will you?

87
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,083
EDWARD:
Excuse me. You in the corner?

88
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:46,917
Are you hungry?

00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:48,833
ERIC:
No. I'm fine, thanks.

90
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,917
Oh, go
on, you must be starving.

91
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,375
Have something.

92
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,917
Okay.

93
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,417
Thanks.

94
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,333
You okay?

95
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:16,583
What's your name?

96
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,958
It's Eric.

97
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,208
How does a guy
like you end up in here?

98
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,000
Like, how do you
end up in prison?

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,917
You don't seem like the type.

100
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,625
Forget to bring your book back
to the library in time or
something?

101
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,708
Murder.

102
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,333
SEAN: Murder?
[chuckles]

103
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,583
You?

104
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,958
What?

105
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,042
How? Who'd you kill?

106
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,500
Come on, tell us.

107
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,083
He doesn't have to
say if he doesn't want to.

108
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,042
Nah, he does.

109
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,042
No, he doesn't.
It's none of your business.

110
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,042
No, no, no. I think it is.

111
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,667
If I'm gonna spend the next
30 days with him, in here.

112
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,667
And he's murdered someone.

113
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,833
I wanna know his
intentions if I kill him.

114
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,750
LUKE:
Why are you in here?

115
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,083
Robbery.

116
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,417
And you?

117
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,292
I didn't pay my taxes.

118
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,750
[♪♪♪]

119
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,958
Can you tell me why those
particular men were chosen for
the experiment?

120
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,750
Oh well, it's been so long. I--

121
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,583
DAVID:
As a psychologist, your job is
to psycho-analyze the subjects,

122
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,167
is it not?

123
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,333
Yes.

124
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,667
But as you know, our main
priority was to ensure the

125
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,167
experiment was completed.

126
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:38,042
I simply recommended the men
I felt had the best chance of
doing that.

127
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,250
On what basis?

128
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,042
Their desire to leave prison.

129
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:47,125
They all had very long sentences
and obviously

130
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,125
any man would do anything for
his freedom.

131
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,125
But surely there are
more factors when choosing

132
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,958
someone besides their
desire to leave?

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You know something like um,
their background, mental state,

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,458
if they're a serial
killer or not.

135
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:13,625
[♪♪♪]

136
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,292
Right, so

137
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,500
girlfriend's
pissed off at me.

138
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,750
So I said to meself, I'm
getting the fuck out of here.

139
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,917
So, jumped on a boat, headed
out to England and here I am.

140
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,000
Blimey, what did you do?

141
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,375
SEAN:
Anything. Anything I could
get me a hands on.

142
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,750
Took any job that anywhere I
could, Eventually,

143
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,250
got a job in the docks in
Liverpool.

144
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,417
Did your father beat you?

145
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,000
SEAN:
What?

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,958
LUKE:
Did your
father beat you?

147
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,583
What are you talking about?

148
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,167
LUKE:
Did he?

149
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,417
Seriously.

150
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,500
What way of a thing
is that to say?

151
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
Huh. Look at the way you're
holding yourself.

152
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,875
Like, do you know what you
look like to me, you're like a
terrier.

153
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,167
You're quick tempered
and you're rude.

154
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:47,458
You're putting on this tough-guy
act and this

155
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,708
deep voice you're trying to
talk, it is
really quite amusing.

156
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,333
Jesus. Shut the fuck up, will
ya?

157
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,917
There's some pain inside
that you're channeling into this
anger.

158
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,083
What-- what-- what is it?

159
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,417
My father never beat me.
I never had a dad.

160
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,917
LUKE:
So that's what's wrong?

161
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,708
No.

162
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,167
-But there is something.
-You wanna shut the fuck up,
mate.

163
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,792
I just don't like seeing
people ungrateful, is all.

164
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,167
-SEAN: Ungrateful?
-Yes, ungrateful?

165
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,792
Ungrateful that
grew up a man with no da.

166
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,958
Ungrateful that me ma had to
walk every single day of the

167
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,083
week to put food on the table.

168
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,542
Ungrateful that I couldn't
afford to stay in school?

169
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,833
Ungrateful, that me
life is a fucking mess?

170
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, I'm fucking ungrateful.

171
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,833
Growing up, my mother was
paralyzed from the neck down.

172
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:46,708
Seeing how helpless she was made
me appreciate everything that I
had.

173
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,333
Didn't really have a home.

174
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,417
One day, I'd stay with my
aunt's, another my uncle's.

175
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,542

179
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,375
And they all get hugs
from their mummy's.

180
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,708
Can you hug me?

181
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,083
" She didn't say anything, but
a tear rolled down her face.

182
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,292
It was the first time
I saw her crying.

183
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,583
Since then, I've always
appreciated everything that I
have.

184
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:40,208
If you have two working legs,
two arms, two eyes, two ears.

185
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:45,083
You have nothing to whine about.
So stop complaining.

187
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,583
Why would
Luke look for sympathy from
Sean?

188
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,500
I thought psychos
can't feel sympathy.

189
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,208
No, they can't.

190
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,500
But they can feel lonely.

191
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,792
Psychopaths are
extremely isolated.

192
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:02,000
They find it very difficult
to relate to anyone.

193
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,250
Out of curiosity, what
are the traits of a psychopath?

[♪♪♪]

195
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,708
Well, some of the traits would
be

196
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,000
dishonesty, lack of guilt,

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,250
manipulativeness.

198
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,125
Reckless risk-taking.

199
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:22,000
He or she will con and
manipulate those around them

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,750
using charisma and intimidation.

201
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,792
And they can effectively mimic
feelings that present

202
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,875
as normal to society.

203
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:36,667
For pleasure, they torture and
murder animals and humans.

204
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,500
It makes them feel something
inside

205
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,625
that empty soul of theirs.

206
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,167
So how do you know
when you're speaking to one?

207
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,375
You don't.

00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,875
RICK:You will begin the physical
exercises now.

00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,333
We will do them in order of
Sean, Luke,

00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,208
Eric, Edward, and
Patrick.

211
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:06,625
You have 60 seconds to
perform
as many push-ups as you can.

EDWARD (VO):
I felt sorry for Eric the most.

218
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,708
He was like a fish out of water.

219
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,792
How did an innocent kid end
up in a place like this?

220
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,375
Well, I suppose I never thought
I'd end up here either.

221
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,375
I like Eric though,
he's a nice guy.

222
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,458
Sean, on the other hand,
seems a bit obnoxious.

223
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,542
Patrick is a good guy, and I can
see me and him getting on over

224
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,750
the next few days.

225
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,375
I don't really know
what to think of Luke.

226
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,750
He's a bit odd.

227
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,958
But it's still a bit too early
to form an opinion on someone.

228
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,750
The way I look at it, it's 30
days until I see my family
again.

229
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,708
This experiment is a
blessing for my girl.

230
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,750
And I'm not gonna
take it for granted.

231
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,833
I know my little girl Isabelle

233
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,667
What was the purpose of creating
this gas?

234
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,500
CHRISTOPHER:
It was for the military, David.

235
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,917
If a soldier doesn't need to
sleep, they have a distinct

236
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,333
advantage over the enemy.

237
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,000
So why were
the diaries added?

238
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Diaries? Could you elaborate?

239
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,708
When we read the
proposal for the experiment,

240
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,750
the proposal that got funding,
there was no diaries.

241
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,500
It was solely testing the
physical side effects of sleep
deprivation.

242
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,083
So why were the diaries added?

243
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,042
Well, it's easier to ask for
forgiveness than for permission.

244
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:24,333
You see Robert, the
mind controls the body.

245
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,375
And as a psychologist, I took
the opportunity of further

246
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,292
studying the human mind in
a controlled environment.

247
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,208
And what attracted you to work
there?

248
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,417
What do you mean?

249
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,708
What made you wanna work
in a place that treated people

250
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,458
like human guinea pigs?

251
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,125
You could say that I was
brainwashed into thinking

252
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,792
that what I was doing was for
greater good of the British
Empire.

253
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,708
The things we did, as horrible
as they were,

254
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,583
brought about a lot of good to
the world.

255
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,375
It's just unfortunate
about the bad.

256
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,583
Interesting.

257
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,917
Because you were the one who
designed the experiment.

258
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,458
Now that's not true!

259
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,625
I only worked as a psychologist
during my time at Porton Down.

260
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,458
But not in
this experiment.

261
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:11,500
We know you were the one who
designed the experiment and gave

262

plans to conduct.

263
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,208
DAVID: Along with Roger, all the
other people who worked on that

264
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,792

you designed it.

Trying to impress my superiors.

268
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:31,625
And I was afraid that we would
not get funding due to my

00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,583
inexperience.

270
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,333
So why does an
inexperienced psychologist

271
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,750
design an experiment testing the
physical side effects of sleep

272
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,500

273
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500

00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:15,125
my daughter never came home one
night after being out.

349
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,750
CHRISTOPHER:
If you wish to
understand Robert, how we could

350
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,958
do all of those horrible things,
then you must realize that we

351
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,208
were doing our job.

352
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,500
ROBERT:
Your job was
running unethical experiments on

353
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,125
naive, vulnerable men--

354
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,458
Those men volunteered by choice.

355
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,875
They would have rotted away in
jail if we didn't give them a

356
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,000
second chance to
redeem themselves.

357
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,250
She was 14.

358
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,750
She always came home.

359
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,000
This night she didn't.

360
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,208
See, I-- I'm not sure
those men were fully aware of

361
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,625
what they were signing
themselves up for.

362
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,750
-Christopher, you personally-
-DAVID: My time--

363
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,750
Designed an
experiment that resulted in the

364
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,958
deaths of nine people.

365
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,000
What are you writing?

366
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,875
It's just you've been
writing for some time now.

367
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:06,000
One of the tapes, uh
tape number 24 was missing.

368
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,958
I just have a lot on my mind.

369
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:14,667
DAVID:
For certain
procedures and protocols,

370
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,167
that are put in place to
protect the subjects.

371
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,500
Not only did you break them,

372
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,750
you completely ignored them.

373
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,667
What are you
in here for Eric?

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,542
They were either in for
murder or attempted murder.

375
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:33,958
Even a child could see, they're
putting all those men in the

376
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:38,042
same room for 30 days without
sleep is a recipe for disaster.

377
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,875
Are you still
not gonna tell us?

378
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,583
Eric strangled a
man to death for God's sake!

379
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:53,417
Eric wasn't some kind of
cold-hearted killer.

380
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,750
He had been bullied
his whole life.

381
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,125
Poor Eric.

382
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,792
He ended up living
a miserable life.

383
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:03,875
Now, I'm not just defying
that what he did was right.

384
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,292
But the poor man was
a ticking time bomb.

385
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,167
Like us all.

386
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:14,875
There's only so
much one can take.

387
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:23,417

389
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,125
You stop breathing please?

390
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,375
Just not-- not so loud, please.
Just stop breathing loud.

391
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,583
Nobody's breathing loudly.

392
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't know-- I
don't why it's annoying me.

393
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,083
It's just-- just please stop.

394
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,917
Do you want us
to kill ourselves?

395
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,250
What? No.

396
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,667
He wants us to
stop breathing, right?

397
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:28,958
[coughing in background]

398
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,167
ERIC:
Can you stop eating too please,
loudly?

399
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,417
Just I'm sorry, please stop.

400
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll eat and breathe
if I want to, mate.

401
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,042
Just-- just not loud. Just not
loud, please.

402
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,292
Just stop!

403
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:46,458
Can you stop?
[Patrick coughing]

404
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,125
ERIC:
It's hurting my head.
Stop coughing so loud.

405
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,333
It's hurting my head.

406
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,958
He's fucking dying!

407
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:56,000
-ERIC: Stop that!

Patrick, you okay? Patrick?

409
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,708
What's wrong?

410
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,375
We need help with him!

411
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,542
RICK:We are opening the doors to
the room.

412
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,667
Step away from the door
and stand with your back
against

413
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,125
the opposite wall.

RICK:Everyone, stop what you're
doing. The door will be opened.

420
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,250
Stand up and stand at the
opposite wall to the
door.

421
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,083
EDWARD:
Hey.

422
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,333
What happened to you?

423
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:56,125
Ah, um, they said that my system
reacted badly to the gas.

424
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,042
Something to do with that.

425
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,958
So, I've bad asthma.

426
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,167
LUKE:
Asthma?

427
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,625
Yeah, asthma.

428
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,333
What type of asthma?

429
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:10,958
[chuckles]

430
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,292
Umm, I don't know.

431
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:15,333
I just know that I have asthma.

432
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,583
LUKE:
You're not allergic to anything?

433
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,875
No.

434
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:22,125
There's six different types
of asthma.

435
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,417
Right, well, I've
always just been told since I

436
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:27,917
was a child that I have asthma.

437
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:30,250
You were away for a while.

438
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,000
PATRICK:
I know.

439
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,583
What happened?

440
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,167
Ahh, doctors
injected me with something.

441
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:39,125
Um, they ran a few
tests on my body.

442
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,125
I really don't
know, to be honest.

443
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,833
EDWARD:
Did they keep you awake?

444
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,042
Oh yeah. Yeah, of course.

445
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,375
So why are you here?

446
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,583
Sorry?

447
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,125
LUKE:
You said it
yourself the gas was reacting

448
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,708
badly with your system.

449
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,875
So why did they put
you back in here?

450
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:57,500
Oh, they've said that
they've lowered the amount of

451
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,708
gas entering the room.

452
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,792
LUKE:
That doesn't make sense.

453
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:04,417
You should've either had an
asthma attack when you first

454
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:06,708
entered or should be
having one right now.

455
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,792
How do you know so much?

456
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,208
LUKE:
I just do.

457
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,583
Maybe you
should work for them.

458
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,375
So it was your decision
to ultimately break protocol?

459
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:25,250
Myself and the others just tried
to get the best possible result.

460
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,875
You were the
one who designed it.

461
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,458
Correct? So therefore,
you are the one at fault.

462
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,250
Everyone that worked on all the
experiments was at fault.

463
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,792
ROBERT:
No.

464
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,917
You're the one who
designed the experiment.

465
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,333
-You're the one who added the
diaries without any permission.
-Wrong.

466
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,375
You're the one who chose
unstable murderers without any

467
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,167
-permission.
-I know that.

468
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,917
But everything I did was
with good intentions.

469
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,250
I promise you.

470
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,125
I just wanted to get the best
results possible to make sure

471
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,750
the experiment was a success.

472
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,667
-Because of your good
intentions, nine people died.
-DAVID: Robert? Robert?!

473
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:57,792
-Of course, I know that!
-Robert!

474
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,625
How do you think that makes me
feel?

475
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,917
You think I wanted
this to happen?

476
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:04,458
You think I wanted
those men to die?

477
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,583
I was just doing my fucking job!

478
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,458
You realize what you
did is a criminal offence.

479
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,625
-And you're gonna go to prison
for a long, long time.
-Robert, stand down!

480
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,125
Get your fucking hands off of
me!

481
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,458
I left Porton Down 15 years ago,
because I could not live with

482
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,833
myself after what had happened.

483
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,625
And now I'm facing jail time.

484
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,208
Even though I've been minding
my own business doing my own

485
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,458
fucking thing for
the last 15 years.

486
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,083
Tell me Robert,

487
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,917
why is this
case so important to you?

488
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,042
What do you mean?

489
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,750
Oh, it's clear.

490
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,083
You have a very strong emotional
connection to the case.

491
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,458
Emotional connection?

492
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:46,000
Yes. It's in the way you speak.

493
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,958
How you ask questions and
how you react to my answers.

494
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,375
You ask questions hoping
that I'm guilty, don't you?

495
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,167
Now why is that though?

496
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,375
Did you know someone that
took part in the experiment?

497
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,875
No?

498
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,250
Oh yes. That's it, isn't it?

499
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:04,875
Now who was it, I wonder?

500
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,875
You would have been too young.

501
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,833
So it can't have been a friend.

502
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,000
It would have been
someone much closer.

503
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,375
It was a parent, wasn't it?

504
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,375
Yes.

505
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,875
It was your father.

506
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,958
You grew up with pure hatred
for Porton Down and all of the

507
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,583
people that worked there.

508
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:30,083
And now finally, you get to
have--

509
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,042
Instead of making up
stories about my partner,

510
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:33,500
just answer the questions.

511
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,042
Making up stories?

512
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,125
Why don't we ask Robert?

513
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:44,917
Burn marks all
over his face and body.

514
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:48,542
What?

515
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,542
Fucking what?

516
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,292
The kids at school used to
laugh at him, because of how he

517
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,875
looked. They said he looked
like a monster.

518
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,250
-DAVID: Robert?
-All because-- shut the fuck up!

519
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,083
-All because he volunteered--

520
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,917
He looked like a monster!

521
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,625
DAVID:
... fuck out of here.

00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,000
What the fuck was that in there?

523
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,708
No wonder you were so keen
to get involved

524
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:07,875
in this investigation.

525
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,208
Why didn't you tell
me about your father?

526
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,958
I didn't think it mattered.

527
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,375
Fucking idget.

528
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,542
You should never have been
involved in this investigation.

529
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,750
This reflects poorly
on me, for fuck's sake.

530
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,708
I'm trying to
do the right thing.

531
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,208
DAVID:
You were manhandling
him in there.

532
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,917
Do you have any idea
who his connections are?

533
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,375
Fuck his connections.

534
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,208
DAVID:
You need to look at
this with a non-biased approach.

535
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,583
I am.

536
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,083
He was just doing his job.

537
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:31,625
Designing experiments
was not part of his job.

538
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,417
If it might break a procedure.

539
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:35,750
But David, I'm not
gonna argue with you.

540
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,875

this fucking interview.

541
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,750

LUKE:
Here, Sean.

544
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,250
You'll do anything for
your mother, right?

545
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,625
Huh?

546
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,417
LUKE:
I'm serious. Imagine if your
mother was still alive.

547
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,792
SEAN:
You're serious, yeah?

548
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,542
Listen.

549
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:17,917
What lengths would you go
to to protect your mother?

550
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:21,500
To-- to-- to make sure
that she felt loved.

551
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,083
Would you, uh...

552
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,875
Why you asking me?

553
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,542
We have this thing in
common and it seems that we're

554
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,708
doing this experiment
for our mothers.

555
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,750
And?

556
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,833
I've killed people.

557
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,125
Oh, so the taxes
thing was bullshit?

558
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,958
Yes.

559
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,500
-Why'd you lie?
-That's no important.

560
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,333
Look I-- what I'm trying to say
is,

561
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,500
if you have a right reason

562
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,167
to kill someone, is
that justifiable?

563
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,292
No.

564
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:58,083
I don't know. I think some
people have it coming.

565
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,042
Who'd you kill?

566
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:05,625
Anyone that mistreated
or disrespected my mother.

567
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,375
Man, woman, child.

568
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,792
You're sick
in the fucking head.

569
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:11,833
Really?

570
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:14,167
Yes.

571
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,333
You would
actually murder a child?

572
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,208
If I had a reason to, yes.

573
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:35,292
What exactly does a
child have to do for you to

574
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:37,417
justify killing them?

575
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:39,250
Why are you even in here?

576
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,292
You're seriously don't have
a response to that here?

577
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,333
Calm down.

578
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,167
And listen to what
I have to say.

579
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:48,250
And then, you'll
understand why I did it.

580
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,000
So I'm sat at home
with my mother.

581
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,250
Just the two of us,
minding our own business.

582
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,542
When I hear this noise.

583
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,583
Bang, bang, bang.

584
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,583
I look outside and I see a
small group running away.

585
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:08,292
They threw stones at the house.

586
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,833
My old disabled mother's house.

587
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,875
Luckily, I saw one of the group.

588
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:20,958
Little girl with a
bright yellow school bag.

589
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:24,333
For a week,

590
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,792
I waited outside
every school in the area

591
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:29,542
to try to find that bag again.

592
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:32,958
Until eventually I did.

593
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,000
I saw her.

594
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,250
And I followed her home.

595
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:42,667
I saw she hung out with her
friends and when she was alone,

596
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,917
and then I kidnapped her.

597
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,750
I kidnapped her.

598
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,417
And I tied her to a post.

599
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,000
And I threw stones.

600
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,250
At her naked body.

601
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,375
Over and over again.

602
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,542
You sick fuck.

be to throw stones at an

-RICK: Luke and Edward, step
away from each other immediately.

606
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,833

from each other.
Immediately.

-No. Look at what she was doing.

00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:15,292
-RICK: Stand with both hands
on the wall, now.
-You bastard.

-Yes.
-Great.

There are just a few documents

On Day 4, 12 and 21,

You will hear a

770
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:43,042
We'll take you out
of the room on those days,

771
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:45,750
so that we can evaluate
your physical and mental

deterioration.

773
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:51,083
You will then be allocated
12 hours of sleep.

And injected with a
shot of noradrenaline.

775

As a safety precaution, we want
you to stay

Shut up.

888
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,292
Green eyes and black hair,
wasn't it?

Shut up!

did she use?

You know what your daughter
said to me before I killed her?

EDWARD:
Shut your mouth.

898
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,625
She was screaming
for her daddy.

-"Daddy, daddy."
-EDWARD: Shut your mouth.

And you weren't
there to rescue her.

I told her I'd let her go
if she did things to me.

We couldn't see inside
the test room,

932
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,917
because Edward had completely

933
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:41,458
covered the observation window
with Luke's blood.

What the
hell are we waiting for?

Let's get Patrick out of there.

CHRISTOPHER: Wait.
-We don't have the time to wait.

in there

and shoot them all dead?

939
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,500
If we go in, Patrick dies.

940
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,667
Let's not do
anything irrational.

941
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:07,167
Well, unless you
have a better plan, Christopher.

942
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:10,125
I suggest this is
our only option.

943

There is
no need for panic here.

944
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,375
We could turn it off.

945
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,375
The gas.

946
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:19,625
It's stopping the process
of melatonin, right?

947
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:22,208
That's what's
keeping them awake.

948
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:24,500
If we turn it off,
they all fall asleep.

949
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,833
It will just be a matter of
going in and taking Patrick out

when he's sleeping.

951
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:31,667
That could work.

And how can we be absolutely
sure that they'll

01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,792

As I said before,
what happened was horrific.

976

But we were brainwashed by the
propaganda the government was

It was just devastating what
those men went through.

do, was get the best results

water was left behind after they

And what were
you trying to achieve?

You know, luckily, the lead
researcher, Christopher, he--

well he knew I couldn't
tolerate anything too graphic.

1020
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:24,667
So, he made sure I saw
as little as possible.

Really?

1028

No, he was completely adamant
about making this experiment a

1029
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:50,625

1030
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:54,958
In fact, he was very
enthusiastic about all the

1031
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,000
experiments he designed.

01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,083

He is in critical condition

it's estimated that he will die

01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,833
What do you want?

1060
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:08,875
How did it feel to end the life
of another human being.

1061
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,542
Did you feel guilty?

1062
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:18,750
No.

1063
01:16:21,917 --> 01:16:25,333
Did you feel guilty
when you killed those two
soldiers?

1064
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,167
No.

1065
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:36,417
Can you describe how you felt
after killing them?

1066
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:43,875
Alive.

1067
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,167
Thank you, Edward.

1068
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:54,458
That's all I need to know.

1069
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:59,208
[♪♪♪]

1070
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:00,958
Wait!

1071
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:03,458
Did Luke kill my daughter?

1072
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:06,417
Please. I deserve to know.

1073
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:27,250
The human mind is amazing.

1074
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,375
What it does to make
us feel comfort.

1075
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,833
What it does to make us
justify our mistakes.

1076
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,292
Luke never killed
your daughter, Edward.

1077
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:46,042
He'd been in prison a long time
before she ever went missing.

1078
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:51,000
It was the idea of vengeance and
revenge for your daughter

1079
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,375
that consumed you.

1080
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:57,208
Always looking for answers.

1081
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,333
Searching for the truth.

1082
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:06,667
Luke caught on to this and
you fell into his trap.

1083
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:11,167
You allowed Luke to
get into your head.

1084
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:12,750
That's not true.

1085
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:13,917
He knew her.

1086
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,875
He knew details about her.

1087
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,333
CHRISTOPHER:
Did he?

1088
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:20,458
Or did you just tell
yourself he did?

1089
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:22,958
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1090
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:26,000
CHRISTOPHER:
Look at yourself, Edward.

1091
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,833
You killed Luke.

1092
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:33,000
You ripped the organs out of
those two men's bodies with your

1093
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,250
bare hands.

1094
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:39,833
You sacrificed the only chance
you ever had of seeing your

1095
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,167
family again.

1096
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:44,000
For what?

1097
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Self-gratification?

1098
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,333
To give yourself a
sense of purpose?

1099
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:59,500
You'll never see your family
again, because of you.

1100
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:04,125
That's the difference
between you and I, Edward.

1101
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:08,792
I'm not pretending to
be someone I'm not.

1102
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:13,875
I know what I am.

1103
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:16,583
What are you? A monster?

1104
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:22,042
It was very apparent that I was
quite

1105
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:25,208
different from all those
around me growing up.

1106
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:32,083
I was aware of other people's
actions, not matching my own.

1107
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:36,750
I didn't feel as they felt.

1108
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:39,875
[♪♪♪]

1109
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,000
I felt nothing.

1110
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:49,708
I couldn't understand what all
the fuss about murdering and

1111
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:51,167
death was.

1112
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:56,708
Just made me more curious to
know what it would feel like to

1113
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,042
kill.

1114
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:03,583
It started as cravings at first.

1115
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,000
I used to torture my pet dog.

1116
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:14,792
But it wasn't until I strangled
him to death that I felt

1117
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:16,292
something.

1118
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,000
And it made me feel alive.

1119
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:28,917
But I had to stop, because
murder is frowned upon in

1120
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:31,875
this civilized society of ours.

1121
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,792
But that feeling of utter
dominance

1122
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:39,125
you get from a kill,

1123
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:41,875
it starts to grow inside.

1124
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:46,000
And soon it becomes
pure compulsion.

1125
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,875
And you have to kill
again and again.

1126
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:54,583
So that's why I work here.

1127
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:59,125
I designed the
experiments to go wrong.

1128
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:03,958
Make them look like an accident.

1129
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:09,500
Accidents happen all the
time in a place like this.

1130
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,875
And the government just comes
along and covers them up.

1131
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:21,125
But it made me wonder,

1132
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:24,875
why me?

1133
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:27,875
Why am I the only one like this?

1134
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:33,458
Or could anyone given the right
circumstances,

1135
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:37,833
take the life of another human
being and enjoy it?

1136
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,083
So I designed this.

1137
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,333
The Sleep Experiment.

1138
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:53,167
Take away basic human needs and
you're left with war and chaos.

1139
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:02,750
So I deprived you of
a basic human need.

1140
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,583
The need to sleep.

1141
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,625
That's why you were chosen.

1142
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:10,542
That's why all of
you were chosen.

1143
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:13,750
You'd all shown signs of this
madness

1144
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:17,375
that I believe lurks deep inside
us all.

1145
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:22,583
Deep down, suppressed,

1146
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:26,958
just waiting to be unleashed.

1147
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:30,542
Out of curiosity, what
are the traits of a psychopath?

1148
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:34,458
CHRISTOPHER:
Some of the traits would be
dishonesty, lack

1149
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:37,542
of guilt, manipulativeness.

1150
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:43,167
They gravitate towards torturing
and murdering humans

1151
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,792
and animals.

1152
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,042
Psychopaths want to be
acknowledged for their

1153
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:49,917
achievements.

1154
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:54,375
How they tricked and deceived
everyone around for so long.

when you're speaking to one?
