0
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,526
I'm gonna go.

1
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,774
Put the money in the bag.

2
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,029
You motherfucking...

3
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,057
No!

4
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,882
Oh shit!

5
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,129
Aaah!

6
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,085
- Freeze, motherfucker! Freeze!
- Freeze, motherfucker!

7
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,453
Get on the ground!

8
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,955
Get on the ground!

9
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,192
Take that fucking mask off
your fucking face,

10
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,160
motherfucker, now!

11
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,862
Take it off now!

12
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:52,433
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

13
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:15,789
Mr. Terry Lamont Savage.

14
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,626
African-American,

15
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,195
born in Atlanta,

16
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,630
straight from high school
into the Marines.

17
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,733
Quickly promoted to Sergeant,

18
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,471
Special Ops Eclipse Unit.

19
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,239
Nice.

20
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,776
Silver Star in Afghanistan,
Soldier's Medal in Iraq,

21
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,613
and a Medal of Honor for your
work in Nigeria.

22
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,713
You're a...

23
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,286
You're a goddamn real life
war hero!

24
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,188
Who are you?

25
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,194
I'm Police Commissioner
Harvey Clarke.

26
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,896
Now, what's a war hero like you

27
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:59,066
doing robbing drug houses
in my city?

28
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,470
Hmm?
No answer?

29
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,703
Interesting.

30
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,372
What happened to you, war hero?

31
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,243
You've thrown away your
entire military career

32
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,578
for a life of crime?

33
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,712
What if I was thrown away?

34
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,682
I served my country,

35
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,484
I come home,

36
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,522
I can't afford medicine, food,

37
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,058
I'm living in
the fucking projects.

38
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,932
What if I told you,
that I could help you?

39
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,735
We could help each other really.

40
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,974
You see there's this prison on
the outskirts of downtown.

41
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:43,310
Degnan Correctional Institute.

42
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,713
It's one of those
corporate-backed private prisons

43
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:50,818
that are propped up by
closeted Republicans,

44
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,354
you know who are supporting
Wall Street goons.

45
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,788
But that's not the point.

46
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,161
There's this Warden there
and he thinks he's God.

47
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,331
No one but trusted employees
and prisoners

48
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,133
are allowed inside.

49
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:10,404
And it is rumored that a lot of
his guards are ex-military,

50
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,942
hired directly
by the Warden himself.

51
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,947
I want you to go inside.

52
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,016
Put your eyes on the place,

53
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,753
find me some evidence of
human rights violations,

54
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,856
corruption.

55
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,892
Anything you can get
your hands on that I can use

56
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,895
to put that motherfucker down.

57
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,138
Go fuck yourself.

58
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,873
Go fuck yourself!

59
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,608
Now you see I could do that.

60
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,611
Sit down, sit down.

61
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,547
You're still facing 10 years
hard time

62
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,016
regardless for armed robbery.

63
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,185
Now you could do 10 years
in the state pen,

64
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,822
or you could go inside Degnan
and get me what I need.

65
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,058
And I will set you free.

66
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,693
You hear me?

67
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,330
Free.
Time served.

68
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,468
Do it for your daughter.

69
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,649
She's... she's got blood...

70
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,748
Blood clots.

71
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,987
And they... and...

72
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,056
Do you... do you understand that?

73
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,761
So what's your answer?

74
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,532
SAVAGE'S DAUGHTER
All I need is you.

75
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,534
So if you would just come back
by my side

76
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,470
I know I'll get better.

77
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,072
Love, I won't be gone.

78
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,208
I won't be gone for long.

79
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:56,610
Okay?

80
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,054
SAVAGE'S DAUGHTER
I had a dream you and I,

81
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,147
we're playing basketball

82
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,350
on the basketball court
by our old house.

83
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,420
You don't have to dream it
we can do it again.

84
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,624
When I...
When I get this medicine,

85
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,861
we're gonna be able to play it
all day,

86
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,864
without ever having to stop.

87
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,868
Time.

88
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,803
Daddy, you're what I need.

89
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,279
When you get inside,

90
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,316
there's gonna be something
waiting for you from me

91
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,416
in your cell.

92
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,988
That will be the only way that
you can report directly to me

93
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,523
from that shitshow.

94
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,527
Other than that,
you're on your own.

95
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,264
Watch yourself,

96
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,533
so you can get back
to that little girl.

97
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,986
Move!

98
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,291
Move!

99
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,029
Move!

100
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,800
Get in here!

101
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,979
Stop!

102
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,482
My name is Lieutenant Killian,

103
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,152
and I own you now!

104
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,321
I will tell you when to bathe!

105
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,092
I will tell you what to wear!

106
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,329
I will tell you when to eat,
sleep, and shit!

107
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,167
Now move!

108
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:35,969
6-2-A.

109
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,039
Get in here!

110
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,311
He's gonna pat you down

111
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,547
and you better not
motherfucking move, boy.

112
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,316
Spread your legs.

113
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,658
Chip him.

114
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,060
I don't fuck with needles.

115
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,165
Chip him now.

116
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,914
Put his ass in Pod 7.

117
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,444
Open doors to Pod 7.

118
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,584
Get up, shitbags!

119
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,386
Get on back!

120
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:46,027
Hey asshole!

121
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,195
I said get on back.

122
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,367
Get your ass out here.

123
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:55,803
Right now!

124
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,807
Today sister,
get over there, boy.

125
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,308
Move it!

126
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,423
All accounted for!

127
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,225
Chow time!

128
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,285
Clumsy monkey!

129
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,922
That's right,

130
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,257
get on your knees and bow down!

131
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,728
Looks like

132
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,189
I'm gonna have to teach you
some respect, little monkey boy.

133
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,438
I'll see you soon, boy.

134
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,573
I'll see you real soon.

135
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:15,910
Yo yo.

136
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,480
You're new here, right?

137
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,289
Well, I hope you can fight,
motherfucker.

138
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,501
How are you liking your stay
thus far?

139
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,240
Yo, this motherfucker still
didn't realize where he is yet.

140
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,876
Motherfucker.

141
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,446
What's your story, black man?

142
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:58,451
You an ally or an enemy?

143
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,089
I'm my own man.

144
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:04,825
Yeah.

145
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,561
Well, let me give you
some advice.

146
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:12,465
Up in here,
you're gonna need allies.

147
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:17,571
Now you could join my family,
my mafia.

148
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,507
We protect our own.

149
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,047
I fly solo.

150
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:37,390
And you gonna die solo, too.

151
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,063
Maybe he wanna die.

152
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,631
Just give me the word.

153
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:56,110
You will all be given
your work assignments.

154
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:01,282
You will perform your
assignments twice a day

155
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,151
unless only altered by
the Warden himself.

156
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,604
Clean this.

157
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:27,208
Clean this shit.

158
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,351
Some of us don't like the way

159
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,098
you've been running things
for the Warden.

160
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,972
Bitch, this ain't no democracy.

161
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,315
Hey!

162
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,882
"Remember your promise to me."

163
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,118
It is my hope.

164
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,520
Your promise revives me.

165
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:51,058
It comforts me.

166
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,264
"Protects me from
all of my troubles."

167
00:19:58,366 --> 00:19:59,967
Welcome to hell, boy.

168
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,685
Are you the new boy?

169
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,957
Told you I'd see you soon,
didn't I?

170
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:51,718
Down or I'll open fire!

171
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:55,489
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

172
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,224
Get these assholes
in the bean hole!

173
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,235
I came here,

174
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:45,772
because you went to sleep
without your superpowers.

175
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,315
Ah.

176
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:04,325
Man up.

177
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:07,595
Man up.

178
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:29,349
Take it, take it.

179
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:30,817
Take that fucking.

180
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:35,156
Now the next time you attack
another prisoner

181
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:37,191
without my permission,

182
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:41,162
I'm gonna turn up the settings,
understood?

183
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:42,662
- Yes, sir.
- Alright.

184
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,007
Now because you broke the rules,

185
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,765
you're gonna have to pick
two of your own

186
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,601
to fight against each other.

187
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,436
Warden, come on,
please don't make me do...

188
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:50,538
Okay, okay, okay.

189
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:51,338
Okay!

190
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,438
Understood.

191
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:54,208
Alright,
get the fuck out of here.

192
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,312
Oh, hold on.

193
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,416
The final thing as discussed.

194
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:05,186
I apologize for my...

195
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:05,986
No, fuck that shit.

196
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:07,121
In his eyes.

197
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,223
Right in his fucking soul,
come on!

198
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:13,693
I apologize for my actions.

199
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,404
I would personally like to
apologize for his actions.

200
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:26,307
Sometimes our fellow inmates,
they can get out of control.

201
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,143
I am sorry.

202
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,244
Terry Savage.

203
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,179
Welcome, sir, have a seat.

204
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,080
Have a seat right there.

205
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,658
I got some stuff I wanna
tell you about.

206
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:37,084
I'm excited, welcome.

207
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:44,858
Oh yeah, that's the wife.

208
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,361
Beauty queen right here.

209
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:50,064
She can't cook for shit though,
I'll tell you that much.

210
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:53,434
Yeah, with her,
we have to pray after we eat,

211
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,002
so we don't shit ourselves.

212
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,338
That was a joke, soldier.

213
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:58,806
You can laugh at that.

214
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:04,411
I'll tell you one thing.

215
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,982
I will kill for my family.

216
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,217
You got a family?

217
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,456
Well, I've got a daughter.

218
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:16,557
What's that?

219
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:17,891
I can't hear you.

220
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,227
I have a daughter.

221
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:21,996
You have a daughter.

222
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:23,530
Look at that, alright.

223
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,432
Well,
then you got one goal here,

224
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,968
one singular focus.

225
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:31,171
To get back to her
as soon as you can.

226
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:39,446
You see, this prison is owned
by a corporation, right.

227
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,650
It's one in a long line of
privately-owned prisons,

228
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,952
it's a chain, alright.

229
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,187
Just like Burger King
or McDonald's

230
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:50,190
and I guess I'm like this
branch's CEO.

231
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:53,894
But I gotta be honest with you,
Terry, it's boring as shit.

232
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,063
Looking in on the product.

233
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,532
Right, we got some McNuggets,
what's in there.

234
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,867
Got a McRib,

235
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,503
You gotta Mcfucking
rehabilitation situation,

236
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,071
I don't give a fuck.

237
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,974
No excitement in it.

238
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,342
So I gotta make it interesting.

239
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:13,947
So what I've done is,
I've created The Dungeon.

240
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:16,784
The Dungeon?

241
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,118
Yeah, The Dungeon.

242
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,421
And from what I heard about you,

243
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,089
you're pretty handy,

244
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,024
you can handle yourself
in there,

245
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:26,060
you'll have a good time.

246
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,929
It's a way to kill time
and to earn rewards.

247
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,964
What's in your wallet?

248
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,099
That's another joke.

249
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:33,967
It's alright,
you can laugh, soldier.

250
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:42,142
Also, it's a good way for you
to get back to your daughter,

251
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:43,310
faster.

252
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,579
Alright?

253
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,750
Now, what I need you to do is
meet your new roommate.

254
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,085
He's gonna prep you,

255
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,954
seeing that you two already
get along.

256
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:57,558
I got a good feeling about you,
Terry.

257
00:25:58,792 --> 00:25:59,828
Alright.

258
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,830
Get on out of here.

259
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,731
Gina, give him his prize.

260
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:13,040
Savage?

261
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,111
The Sergeant Terry Savage?

262
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,882
I served in the 77th Wolfpack.

263
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:23,951
You and your squad

264
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:25,328
saved my life
when my troops were outnumbered

265
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:27,621
right outside Kabul
a few years ago.

266
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,190
You're a legend.

267
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:40,826
I was just doing my job only.

268
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:50,677
I don't know how somebody like
you ends up in here.

269
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:53,480
Don't expect no favors.

270
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,083
I'm just doing my job.

271
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:58,285
Now move.

272
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,021
Yes, ma'am.

273
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:04,925
Open 243.

274
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:08,729
Go on.

275
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:20,974
Welcome.

276
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,645
Make yourself at home.

277
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:28,817
Would you please um,
respect my house

278
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,919
and take off your shoes.

279
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,653
It's my house, no shoes.

280
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,521
Okay.

281
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,226
So,

282
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,230
you play dominoes?

283
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:46,066
No.

284
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,036
Damn.

285
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,973
Where'd you learn to fight?

286
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,611
My father was a Grand Master
up in Okla.

287
00:27:57,711 --> 00:28:01,816
So I grew up in his dojo
where he taught me how to fight,

288
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,518
physically and spiritually.

289
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:09,122
You're gonna have to survive
The Dungeon.

290
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,092
Whatever it takes.

291
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:16,129
I just wanna get home
to my daughter.

292
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,600
Well, you're inside
the system now, soldier.

293
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,337
This place was designed to break

294
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,472
black and brown bodies like you

295
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:27,774
and you fell right in.

296
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:31,745
So if you have any hope of ever
seeing your little girl again,

297
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:33,747
you gonna need to do two things.

298
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,886
The first one is forget about
that outside world.

299
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,219
Including, your little girl,

300
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,923
'cause holding onto that
unreality

301
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:44,424
will get you killed
in this reality.

302
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,260
And secondly,

303
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,795
you're gonna have to survive
The Dungeon.

304
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,099
I can help you do that.

305
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:55,702
Why should I trust you
or anybody else

306
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:57,070
in this system?

307
00:28:58,438 --> 00:28:59,673
You can't.

308
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:06,446
You mind if I use
your bathroom, OG?

309
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,148
Call me "Bones".

310
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,783
It's your bathroom now.

311
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,756
Mind the curtain.

312
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:02,235
Where're we going?

313
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:03,871
Our new work assignment.

314
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,374
Keep moving!

315
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:20,754
Get to work.

316
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,229
Now this area right here,

317
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:33,400
this entire place used to be
used to break up circuit boards

318
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,871
that the Warden would re-sell.

319
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:39,339
Now we get to use it
to spar here.

320
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,742
They got us locked up
like animals.

321
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,612
Now we gotta fight like 'em.

322
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:49,258
See you're different from a lot
of the catch

323
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:51,518
that run through this place.

324
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:54,488
That's why when the Warden
asked why I helped you,

325
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:57,391
I told him it's 'cause
you reminded me

326
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:00,227
of a young man
I knew a long time ago.

327
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:05,198
Now no matter what,
in order to survive this place,

328
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,834
you're going have to fight.

329
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:10,771
The Warden is gonna throw
your ass inside that Dungeon

330
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:12,172
whether you like it or not

331
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:16,710
and whether you live or die,
depends on what you know.

332
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:19,513
Now let me help you.

333
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:24,785
Do me the favor
and show me what you got.

334
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:47,041
That's the Mexican Mob
over there,

335
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,642
la familia.

336
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,146
Then you've got the
Dragon Nation,

337
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,848
ruthless.

338
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:55,749
Nobody fucks with them.

339
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,553
And you've met the
Aryan Brotherhood,

340
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,521
aka The Klan,

341
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:05,525
With your encounter with
Mongul, their uh, leader.

342
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,761
Y'all gonna be good friends.

343
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,399
Now you've met my man Freeway.

344
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,369
He's crew is the Black Mafia.

345
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,842
His style is a combination of
almost every style.

346
00:32:22,143 --> 00:32:26,680
But his nature is formless,
so he calls himself "Freeway".

347
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,851
That's crazy,

348
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:32,854
combine other styles.

349
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,756
He's good at that.

350
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:39,193
I taught him.

351
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,970
That's enough, that's enough.

352
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:51,982
Now I'm gonna share something
with you

353
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:54,541
that I've rarely seen or said.

354
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,912
You got all the heart
in the world,

355
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:02,016
but if you're gonna survive
The Dungeon tomorrow night,

356
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:03,276
you're gonna need some skill.

357
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,654
What do you mean tomorrow?

358
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:09,556
Every Friday,
is spent here in that Dungeon.

359
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,562
Let me show you
what will help you.

360
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:18,765
It starts with this.

361
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:26,339
Surrender,

362
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:29,543
surrender.

363
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:34,548
Accept where you are.

364
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,286
Accept this reality.

365
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:57,704
Dungeon Time!

366
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:45,719
Stop!

367
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:48,089
Take them to The Dungeon.

368
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:49,357
I gotta go meet the Warden.

369
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,125
Yes, sir.

370
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:53,327
I don't think your boy is
gonna make it, Bones.

371
00:34:55,296 --> 00:34:56,796
Hey let's go, come on.

372
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:13,080
Good luck down there, Savage.

373
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,687
Open 305.

374
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:30,664
Right.

375
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:32,498
Rene, hold my calls.

376
00:35:36,404 --> 00:35:37,905
Who wants it tonight?

377
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:41,508

Welcome to The Dungeon!

400
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:57,584
[({inmates cheering]

401
00:36:57,684 --> 00:37:01,554
Here we are,
trapped in this hall together.

402
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:02,654
But look,

403
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:04,392
we get out of our cages
once a week

404
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:05,759
for one reason only.

405
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,229
And that is, The Dungeon!

406
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:14,301
I need y'all to understand
that there is one rule

407
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:15,936
and one rule only.

408
00:37:16,037 --> 00:37:17,505
Alright?

409
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:19,524
And that's that there are
no motherfucking rules!

410
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:21,042
Make some noise!

411
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:26,013
Let's get it on!

412
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,450
Let's go, gentlemen.

413
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:30,583
Show me what you got.

414
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,408
Fucking Warden!

415
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:28,608
Well...

416
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:33,214
you made your bed, son,
you made your bed.

417
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:34,215
Alright.

418
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:35,049
Who's up next?

419
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:36,016
Let's go.

420
00:38:36,117 --> 00:38:37,818
Keep it moving.

421
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:39,220
There's a momentum score,
people.

422
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,489
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

423
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:43,858
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

424
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,460
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

425
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
It's pointless.

426
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:04,411
Where are you?

427
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:05,678
Ah!

428
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:10,317
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

429
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,620
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

430
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,255
Freeway! Freeway!

431
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:22,129
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!
Freeway! Freeway!

432
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,766
Now, up next we got some
fresh meat,

433
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,936
by the name of Savage!

434
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,639
Who was causing hell upstairs,
so we brought him downstairs

435
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:32,738
for a little training.

436
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,412
Let's see what you got, Savage.

437
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:39,813
In the opposing corner,

438
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:43,284
we have our local favorite
from the Mexican Mob,

439
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:47,021
El Vampiro!!!

440
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:51,758
He calls himself, "El Vampiro"

441
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:55,029
because he sharpens his teeth
like a vampire.

442
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:57,207
He ain't going for your face,
he's going for your legs.

443
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,400
This whole thing is
to take you down.

444
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,535
Watch yourself.

445
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:03,237
Watch your hands of course.

446
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,410
Wooh, wooh, wooh, yeah.

447
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,654
Reach inside of him,

448
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:56,156
pull his soul out,
if he have one.

449
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:59,493
You trained about black eyes
and bloody noses.

450
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:02,863
You gotta go out there
as life of fucking death.

451
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,598
What's wrong?

452
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,867
Don't let him take
the next round!

453
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,335
Come on, get him, man!

454
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:09,303
Come on now.

455
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,904
Let's go, keep it moving.

456
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,359
What the fuck was that?

457
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,262
Okay.

458
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:36,764
That's how you do it!

459
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:37,998
Yeah! Yeah!

460
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:39,298
That's what I'm talking about.

461
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,333
Yeah!

462
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:50,316
At least bring some water.

463
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:52,713
Carry that man.

464
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,291
We ain't... we ain't got all day
for this.

465
00:41:54,315 --> 00:41:55,683
You alright?

466
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:20,541
Freeway!

467
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,875
Mmm.

468
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,112
There's my quarterback.

469
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,581
That's some great work
in The Dungeon, my man.

470
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:28,716
What can I get for you?

471
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:29,450
Steak dinner?

472
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,884
A conjugal?

473
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:33,020
Anything you want, you name it.

474
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:35,622
How about you cut the bullshit?

475
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,259
Tell me why Bones is helping
the new guy?

476
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,927
Well, hold...

477
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:41,261
Eh, slow down, son.

478
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:42,196
What... I...

479
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:44,231
It sounds like
you're interrogating me.

480
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:47,034
Well, I mean I'm the best
motherfucker you got.

481
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:48,869
Don't I deserve to know?

482
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,442
Bones claims that the new kid
reminds him of family

483
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:56,542
or something.

484
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:58,212
And he requested to have
his back.

485
00:42:58,312 --> 00:42:58,912
What... wh...

486
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,080
What's going on here?

487
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,783
Are you intimidated,
by the new guy?

488
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:04,017
What's happening?

489
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:05,919
I ain't intimidated by nobody.

490
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:07,754
Good.

491
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:11,392
Then everything will
remain peaceful around here.

492
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:13,292
Yeah.

493
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,729
Things are peaceful,
because I'm the one.

494
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:20,033
I'm the one enforcing your law
in and outside The Dungeon.

495
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:21,435
And you're doing a lovely job.

496
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:24,605
Have I not told you how much
I appreciate you?

497
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:26,106
Good.

498
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:27,040
Great,

499
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:28,742
because I want what you
promised me.

500
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:29,643
So when do I get out?

501
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:30,778
Are we doing this again?

502
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:31,879
Are we doing it?

503
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:32,646
Look, let me get this straight.

504
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:33,547
Hold on a second.

505
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:34,915
I let you and your crew,

506
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:37,584
your posse,
whatever you wanna call,

507
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:38,786
treat this whole place like

508
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,296
it's your own private little
street corner.

509
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,789
That's what I'm doing for you.

510
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:42,723
That's not enough?

511
00:43:42,824 --> 00:43:43,690
Yeah.

512
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,827
Yeah, I got shit on lock.

513
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:47,928
But if you can't keep your word,

514
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:50,039
then maybe I can't guarantee
that all these prisoners

515
00:43:50,063 --> 00:43:51,365
are gonna keep falling in line.

516
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,466
Are you...

517
00:43:55,068 --> 00:43:56,508
It sounds like you're
threatening me?

518
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:58,337
That...

519
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,375
Have I created a monster?

520
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:02,877
I want my freedom,

521
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,145
that's what you fucking
promised me.

522
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:09,016
I'mma working on it.

523
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:11,618
I'm having conversations with
the Warden

524
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:12,986
at the Aurora State Prison

525
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:15,489
about getting you a re-match
with his Top Dog.

526
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:19,259
You win that for me again,
you get your freedom.

527
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,561
Stay sharp!

528
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:23,363
I'm always sharp.

529
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:26,266
I want my freedom.

530
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:28,602
Alright.

531
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:38,445
Yeah, well, I want Cindy
Crawford to rub my balls

532
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:40,915
and make me a casserole.

533
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,617
But I live in reality,
motherfucker!

534
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:04,004
Savage, you have a visitor.

535
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:10,444
Hi, Mr. Savage, it's a pleasure
to meet you in person.

536
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:11,678
I'm Janette.

537
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:14,014
I work for a pro-bono group,
National Veterans Affairs

538
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,415
and I've been assigned
your case.

539
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:19,921
You are
a highly-decorated soldier

540
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:23,323
and I'm aware of your daughter's
medical condition.

541
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:26,693
You're not a criminal.

542
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:28,562
You were pushed into a corner.

543
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:31,765
You can't help me.

544
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:36,871
I graduated cum laude from
Howard University School of Law.

545
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:39,273
I'm hihgly capable.

546
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:41,742
I'm prepared
to fight for your freedom.

547
00:45:41,843 --> 00:45:42,476
Freedom?

548
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:43,576
Yeah.

549
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:47,347
There's been a lot of intel
coming out

550
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:49,116
about too many
new private prisons

551
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:51,785
and a lack of prisoners
to keep them filled.

552
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:55,155
And some cities are so desperate
to keep these institutions open

553
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:58,125
and the extra boost it gives
to the local job economy,

554
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:00,494
they are creating a new system.

555
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:04,765
One of supply and demand
of live human bodies.

556
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,070
Mostly our people,
black and brown people.

557
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:16,543
Mr. Savage,
I need you to stay strong, okay?

558
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:18,712
We can fight this corrupt system
together.

559
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:21,248
I just need you to trust me.

560
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:23,617
I'm in here.

561
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,922
They have physical custody
of my body.

562
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:29,323
They own me.

563
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:33,694
Therefore,
I must do what they say

564
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,396
when they say.

565
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:42,269
Listen, if you...
If you need anything,

566
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:44,403
call me.

567
00:46:45,907 --> 00:46:47,842
I am goin'
to do everything I can

568
00:46:47,942 --> 00:46:49,476
to get you out of here.

569
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:56,216
I... I appreciate you, but um,

570
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,619
I'm gonna have to handle this
on my own.

571
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:24,812
Ignore him.

572
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,547
You know I don't give a fuck

573
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,717
about what he's showin' you.

574
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:32,252
I hope you know that.

575
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:35,522
You can't fuck with me.

576
00:47:35,622 --> 00:47:38,358
I ain't
like these other motherfuckers.

577
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:52,406
You know, the truth is

578
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,741
you and Freeway
are a whole lot alike.

579
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:59,513
I ain't got shit
to do with that man.

580
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:00,882
Oh yeah, you do.

581
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:03,116
Think about it.

582
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:05,619
Both of y'all are ex-military.

583
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,924
He spent most of his life
fightin' in the streets, too.

584
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,326
Truth is I tried to save him,

585
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:15,796
but he refused
to let me help him.

586
00:48:15,897 --> 00:48:18,765
He was determined
to take the dark path.

587
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:23,370
What makes you think
I ain't gonna go dark?

588
00:48:26,941 --> 00:48:29,143
You got your little girl.

589
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:30,553
That gives you something
to live for,

590
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:34,247
that's something
that Freeway never even had.

591
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:38,685
So in that case,
you two are polar opposites.

592
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,220
Yin and yang.

593
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:46,793
Now this next fighter
that you're gonna face

594
00:48:46,894 --> 00:48:49,130
is named "Zee".

595
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,598
He is the Dragon Nation's

596
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,367
best fighter.

597
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:57,471
If you have any chance
of beating him,

598
00:48:57,571 --> 00:49:00,041
you're going
to have to use your strength

599
00:49:00,141 --> 00:49:03,376
against his agility
and his speed.

600
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:06,613
Brute force.

601
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:10,084
Sometimes it's okay
to go gorilla, eh.

Let's go!

640
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:37,697
You know, one of the good things
about being an OG in this place

641
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:39,934
is you know
where to get what you need.

642
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:41,302
Yeah.

643
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:43,104
I got nothin' to celebrate.

644
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:45,378
This ain't no celebration, man.

645
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:49,110
We... it's a reward
for still bein' alive.

646
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:52,914
Come on, man, don't...
Don't insult me.

647
00:51:53,014 --> 00:51:57,450
Huh, these days I drink
just about anything, man.

648
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,524
Why are you on the inside?

649
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:08,028
Murder.

650
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:12,766
Murder?

651
00:52:12,867 --> 00:52:14,201
Yeah, murder.

652
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,737
See you ain't the

653
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:21,441
only holder
of a patent on stupidity.

654
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:24,477
I was young like you once, too.

655
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:26,746
Anyway, um...

656
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:33,054
This psycho rapist put his hands
on my little sister.

657
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:37,191
I mean she was 21,
but she's still my baby sister.

658
00:52:38,725 --> 00:52:40,895
So I went out for revenge,
and I found him,

659
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:44,332
and uh, beat that predator
to death

660
00:52:44,432 --> 00:52:46,000
with my bare hands.

661
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:52,239
What started out for revenge,
the karma of the universe, man,

662
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,775
I ended up having to pay
with my soul.

663
00:52:56,877 --> 00:52:58,778
Don't let that happen to you.

664
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:06,988
You know, sometimes I wonder...

665
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:11,192
if I still have a soul.

666
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:15,162
You do.

667
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:18,299
I can see it.

668
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:30,543
Hey, you want some chips?

669
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:45,026
What's goin' on?

670
00:53:47,261 --> 00:53:49,096
You're a threat now.

671
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:36,609
Fuck.

672
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:55,362
♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪

673
00:54:55,463 --> 00:54:58,332
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey oh ♪

674
00:54:58,432 --> 00:55:00,367
Freeze or I'll drop you both!

675
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:04,271
No!

676
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:11,011
Shit, oh shit.

677
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:12,112
Fuck.

678
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:16,349
Hold on.

679
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:18,119
Hold on, no, wait.

680
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:20,955
I was just doing my job.

681
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:22,655
Oh. Oh my God.

682
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:24,158
Now we're even.

683
00:55:24,258 --> 00:55:25,392
Please.

684
00:55:25,493 --> 00:55:27,660
Help!

685
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:35,369
Come in.

686
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,809
Hey, thank you.

687
00:55:44,912 --> 00:55:47,481
Because of your quick thinkin'
that guard's gonna live

688
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:49,782
and you saved my ass

689
00:55:49,884 --> 00:55:52,386
from a lot of
unwanted attention.

690
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,957
That female guard,
she risked it all for me.

691
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:58,159
She did.

692
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,128
I feel your pain, believe me,
I do.

693
00:56:01,228 --> 00:56:03,330
It's one thing if a prisoner
dies on the inside,

694
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,430
but a guard?

695
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:09,203
Man, that shows my... my weakness
to control this institution.

696
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:11,472
So thank you.

697
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:15,409
And by the way, I might
have a little talk with Freeway.

698
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,311
For what?

699
00:56:18,379 --> 00:56:19,379
Fuck him.

700
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,216
I'm ready to take his ass out.

701
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:23,384
Set up the fight.

702
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:26,153
No, you haven't made your way
to that fight yet.

703
00:56:26,987 --> 00:56:28,267
Sorry, I can't make that happen.

704
00:56:28,355 --> 00:56:29,355
Why not?

705
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,527
You control all the shit
inside these walls, right?

706
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:34,828
That I do.

707
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:36,596
I control it all.

708
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,032
Don't get it twisted.

709
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:43,170
But uh, is that a fight
you're ready for?

710
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:53,246
Set it up.

711
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,853
Guard, back to my cell.

712
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:02,556
All right.

713
00:57:02,656 --> 00:57:03,723
All right.

714
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,246
Yeah, you know, you fucked up,
right?

715
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:27,624
We thought we'd take him out
for you, man?

716
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:28,848
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

717
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:31,885
I never gave that fuckin' order!

718
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,855
Dumbass motherfucker.

719
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:40,861
Warden wants to see you
in the dungeon.

720
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:42,896
All of you.

721
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:59,980
Y'all wanna know
why this is my favorite room?

722
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,781
It's 'cause I can
turn off these cameras

723
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,284
whenever I want.

724
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:05,385
Yeah.

725
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:06,754
Come on in the ring, boys,

726
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,788
I wanna talk about
some business!

727
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:12,969
Oh, that's funny, I...
I could have sworn

728
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,128
I was in charge.

729
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:16,130
See the ring, go there!

730
00:58:29,043 --> 00:58:30,811
You still can't follow rule.

731
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:32,812
Okay.

732
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:44,191
You broke
my motherfuckin' rules!

733
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:47,561
Kill him!

734
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,900
What the f... what the fuck, man?

735
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:05,913
I'm the head motherfucker
in charge.

736
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:12,119
I never gave that order.

737
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:13,787
I get it.

738
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,322
Fuck, I get it!

739
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:18,659
I fucked up.

740
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:20,994
I'm glad
we're on the same page now.

741
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:22,730
Now you're gonna do
whatever I want.

742
00:59:22,831 --> 00:59:23,731
What do you want from me?

743
00:59:23,832 --> 00:59:26,200
I want you to fight Savage.

744
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,503
No, he hasn't earned that spot.

745
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:31,638
Why are you so fuckin' stupid?

746
00:59:33,107 --> 00:59:35,609
You wanna spend the rest
of your life in prison?

747
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:38,112
You afraid of him? What is it?

748
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:43,250
Okay.

749
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,688
I'll fight.

750
00:59:47,788 --> 00:59:49,723
I'm glad we're on the same page.

751
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:51,158
I'm glad you're excited.

752
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:52,426
I am.

753
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:58,232
Would be great to see
the two of you battle it out.

754
00:59:58,332 --> 01:00:01,235
I'm glad we had this little
attitude adjustment.

755
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:08,308
Back to your cage, top dog.

756
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,511
Move!

757
01:00:23,424 --> 01:00:25,292
What are you
specifically hitting?

758
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:26,861
A person.

759
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,162
A person.

760
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:30,531
Well, hit what he's
goin' to hit you with.

761
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:33,534
Hit his hands.

762
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:38,005
Let his hands come at you,
and anticipate it,

763
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:39,606
and stop it.

764
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:01,128
I heard you wanna see me
in the dungeon.

765
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:04,465
I don't fuck with bullies.

766
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:09,336

Wooh, shit! You ready?

805
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:17,331
God damn!

806
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:19,471
Let's see if we're gonna
crown ourselves a new king!

807
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:23,071
My kingdom for a crown.

Yes, sir.

812
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:36,316
Man, I love you.

813
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:51,966
Take it away, warden!

814
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:53,901
Fight!

815
01:03:54,035 --> 01:03:57,471
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

816
01:03:57,571 --> 01:03:59,539
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

817
01:04:03,945 --> 01:04:05,913
Tonight, gentlemen,

818
01:04:06,014 --> 01:04:08,482
I got something truly special
for you.

819
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:12,686
Two gladiators, two warriors.

820
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:17,257
One will come out a champion
and the other...

821
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,894
Well, there may be
a lot of slow singin'

822
01:04:19,994 --> 01:04:21,495
and flower bringin'

823
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:23,931
when that motherfuckin' bell
starts ringin'.

824
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:25,499
You know what I'm sayin'?

825
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,836
Let's give it up for Savage!

826
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:44,852
And over here,
we got our top dog.

827
01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:47,554
Give it up for Freeway!

828
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:07,274
Let's get it on!

829
01:05:07,374 --> 01:05:08,374
Yeah!

830
01:06:30,124 --> 01:06:32,626
Savage! Stop!

831
01:06:32,726 --> 01:06:33,726
What?

832
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:37,330
That's enough. Come on!

833
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,268
Wooh, Savage is the man now,
baby!

834
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:43,237
Savage! Savage! Savage!

835
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:47,440
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage!

836
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:52,379
Yeah!

837
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:53,780
That's the spirit. Come on!

838
01:06:56,683 --> 01:07:00,654
Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage,
Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage!

839
01:07:14,668 --> 01:07:15,668
Wooh!

840
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:13,526
Well, if you don't mind...

841
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:28,943
Apparently, you are the man.

842
01:08:47,295 --> 01:08:49,230
I could get used to this.

843
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,665
But the part you left out is

844
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,602
havin' to keep eyes
on the back of my head.

845
01:08:55,702 --> 01:08:57,138
Ain't no growin' when you don't.

846
01:08:57,238 --> 01:08:58,940
The warden wants to see you.

847
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:05,846
When you're done eating,
of course.

848
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,522
That's too much power
for one convict.

849
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,527
There he is.

850
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:24,165
How does it feel
to be The Man now?

851
01:09:24,265 --> 01:09:26,300
Huh? Have a seat.

852
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,235
Go on, have a seat!

853
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:30,338
You deserve it. You kiddin' me?

854
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:31,939
The way you just
beat down Freeway,

855
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:36,010
I could have sold that
for 69.99 on pay-per-view.

856
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:40,982
You and me we could do
a lot of business together.

857
01:09:41,082 --> 01:09:42,316
Come on.

858
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,251
You know what?

859
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:48,222
Let's go for a walk. Come on.

860
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:49,622
Take a little victory lap,
champ.

861
01:09:51,325 --> 01:09:53,060
Let's go, champ.

862
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,895
I wanna show you somethin'.

863
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:55,996
Come on.

864
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,536
Look at this. See that?

865
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:05,806
All eyes are on you, Tupac.

866
01:10:05,906 --> 01:10:07,375
Come on now.

867
01:10:07,475 --> 01:10:08,909
You got everyone's attention now

868
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:11,278
and you got my attention
as well.

869
01:10:11,379 --> 01:10:13,247
You're the people's champ.

870
01:10:13,347 --> 01:10:14,115
Can you feel it?

871
01:10:14,215 --> 01:10:15,215
You feel that power?

872
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,685
So you think about that
what you wanna do with that.

873
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,521
I got a proposition for you.

874
01:10:23,324 --> 01:10:24,324
You see what I see?

875
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:25,860
Yeah, a lot of bad decisions.

876
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,694
Yeah, I see what you see.

877
01:10:28,628 --> 01:10:31,232
These are fathers, big brothers.

878
01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:36,904
Leaders, kings, patriarchs,
alphas.

879
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:40,307
They come in here
with a problem,

880
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,843
they leave with a problem.

881
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,879
There's no rehabilitation, sir.

882
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:47,647
All right, well, listen,
let me tell you something.

883
01:10:48,816 --> 01:10:51,118
I'm a problem solver, okay?

884
01:10:51,218 --> 01:10:52,353
Walk with me.

885
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,288
I wanna show you
how to solve your problems.

886
01:10:54,388 --> 01:10:55,990
I can't fix everyone's problem.

887
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,425
Come on, let's walk.

888
01:10:57,525 --> 01:10:58,092
All right, listen...

889
01:10:58,192 --> 01:10:59,193
Got you.

890
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:00,293
Come on.

891
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:02,430
Come on, champ, listen to me.

892
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,597
You could run this place.

893
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:07,667
With me havin' your back,
come on now,

894
01:11:07,767 --> 01:11:09,769
nothing could take you down.

895
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:10,870
Nothing.

896
01:11:12,572 --> 01:11:13,908
You wanna run this place?

897
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,848
I don't want it.

898
01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:23,918
Well, before you turn me down,

899
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:26,520
why don't you see
what you're missin'?

900
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:27,822
Come on now.

901
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:29,390
You can't even
make a decision yet.

902
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:30,690
Come on!

903
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:40,000
It's all right, fellas,
keep workin'.

904
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:41,435
Keep working.

905
01:11:41,535 --> 01:11:42,303
Play through.

906
01:11:42,403 --> 01:11:43,971
Good job, everybody.

907
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:46,474
Good to see you.

908
01:11:46,574 --> 01:11:48,843
Right here, you look at that,

909
01:11:48,943 --> 01:11:52,379
some of the best chronic
in the city, right there.

910
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,714
We get that
to local dispensaries

911
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:56,350
and we get it at a discount.

912
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:57,952
That's legal.

913
01:11:58,052 --> 01:12:00,620
Sticky icky icky,
you know what that is.

914
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,256
And right over here...

915
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,827
you know, that's the uh,
pure Bolivian marching powder.

916
01:12:06,927 --> 01:12:09,930
A little pick-me-up, you know,
when you go to Cancun.

917
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,132
Okay.

918
01:12:11,265 --> 01:12:13,265
You got your pharmaceuticals
in case you, you know,

919
01:12:13,334 --> 01:12:15,668
you need to do your homework,
you need to focus up.

920
01:12:15,768 --> 01:12:17,371
And over right there...

921
01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:18,771
There.

922
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:23,978
That's the US currency, man,
that's the fruit of your labors.

923
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:26,013
That's gonna go right
in our pockets.

924
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:29,216
This is uh...

925
01:12:30,683 --> 01:12:32,719
this is modern-day slavery.

926
01:12:33,686 --> 01:12:35,456
I would...
I wouldn't call it "slavery".

927
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:36,556
Come on now.

928
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:37,969
I... I would call it um,
you know,

929
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:39,927
let's called is "free labor".

930
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:42,695
It's the American way.

931
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:46,766
Think about it.

932
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:48,735
All right.

933
01:12:50,337 --> 01:12:52,306
Come on, come on.

934
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,960
Why are you showin' me all this?

935
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:05,252
Because I want you
to be the first top dog

936
01:13:05,352 --> 01:13:09,356
to enjoy all the full perks
of your labor.

937
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:10,456
All right?

938
01:13:10,491 --> 01:13:11,859
Why not?

939
01:13:15,496 --> 01:13:16,230
You know why.

940
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,898
Think about it.

941
01:13:24,737 --> 01:13:25,606
You good?

942
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:26,473
Yeah.

943
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:27,441
You good?

944
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:28,775
I'm gonna think about it.

945
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:30,743
- Yeah, there you go.
- Just think about it.

946
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,747
Ruminate on it.

947
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:35,748
Good job, fellas.

948
01:13:35,849 --> 01:13:36,716
Keep... keep playin' through.

949
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:38,219
Good work, everybody.

950
01:13:39,286 --> 01:13:40,821
Come on in.

951
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:42,441
I want you to take a look
at something.

952
01:13:42,523 --> 01:13:43,824
Come on, over here.

953
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:45,192
Can you... excuse me.

954
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:47,194
Can you show this to him,
please?

955
01:13:47,294 --> 01:13:49,430
I want you to take a look
at this right here.

956
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,165
Take a good look, okay?

957
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:52,799
You wanted justice...

958
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,402
All right, for the guard
that saved your life.

959
01:13:55,502 --> 01:13:57,371
This is justice right here.

960
01:13:57,471 --> 01:13:59,840
Take a look. Okay?

961
01:14:02,443 --> 01:14:05,212
I want you to know
that I am here for you.

962
01:14:05,312 --> 01:14:07,014
There's nothin'
I won't do for you.

963
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:09,950
I wanna show you that I am loyal

964
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,186
to those people
that are loyal to me.

965
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,221
Sir.

966
01:14:17,992 --> 01:14:20,127
Nobody goes this far.

967
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:23,397
Understand?

968
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:26,533
Well.

969
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:27,635
I just want my daughter.

970
01:14:27,835 --> 01:14:28,945
Okay,
we're gonna get your daughter.

971
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:29,969
Yeah?

972
01:14:30,004 --> 01:14:32,172
Yeah. I'm... I'm here for you.

973
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:38,245
- I am loyal.
- Yeah.

974
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:39,480
This is loyalty.

975
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,580
Mmhmm.

976
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:43,350
Cover that up.

977
01:14:58,866 --> 01:15:00,167
Come on in.

978
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:06,073
I'll... I'll wait back here.

979
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,976
I'm done with this.

980
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:10,978
You're done...

981
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:16,183
when we say you're done.

982
01:15:18,485 --> 01:15:19,586
Have a seat.

983
01:15:21,488 --> 01:15:23,757
Fuck is goin' on?

984
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:25,159
Yeah, that's right.

985
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:28,062
What the fuck?

986
01:15:28,228 --> 01:15:31,498
Sorry, it uh, took me a minute
to respond to your last text,

987
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:34,702
but I... I figured it'd be better
if we all got together

988
01:15:34,802 --> 01:15:36,337
and spoke in person.

989
01:15:36,503 --> 01:15:39,740
Now I thought you said he'd be
willing to go all the way.

990
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,642
Oh, he will be.

991
01:15:41,742 --> 01:15:43,277
This was uh...

992
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:46,180
It's all a game, hmm?

993
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,348
You see,

994
01:15:47,448 --> 01:15:50,951
my good friend,
the commissioner and myself...

995
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:52,453
Oh yeah, we're good friend.

996
01:15:53,454 --> 01:15:55,789
We're gonna split
this whole thing 50-50,

997
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:56,990
all right?

998
01:15:57,157 --> 01:15:58,702
And I wanted to cut you in
on the profit,

999
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:01,195
but you didn't want
any part of it.

1000
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:03,697
Really too bad,
because it's quite profitable.

1001
01:16:03,797 --> 01:16:05,399
Yeah.

1002
01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:07,177
Especially, when you add
the gambling ring that we run

1003
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:11,705
and seven other private prisons
in nearby counties,

1004
01:16:11,806 --> 01:16:14,575
pitting top dogs
against our top dog.

1005
01:16:14,675 --> 01:16:17,211
And you're our top dog now.

1006
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:19,146
You work for us.

1007
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:23,384
Hell, you exceeded expectations.

1008
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:24,585
I even won the wager.

1009
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:26,129
Oh, come on, really?
I thought you forgot about that.

1010
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:27,588
- Come on, give it up.
- Uh, dammit.

1011
01:16:27,688 --> 01:16:28,789
Give it up.

1012
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:30,491
Rub it in, huh, Harvey?

1013
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:33,660
There we go.

1014
01:16:34,863 --> 01:16:38,499
Okay. I'm done... done with this.

1015
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:42,169
Now I knew he'd go soft on us.

1016
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:43,269
Uh-huh?

1017
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,372
That's why I got a plan B
for your ass.

1018
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:46,573
Well, how about that?

1019
01:16:46,673 --> 01:16:48,242
Bring him in here.

1020
01:16:52,312 --> 01:16:53,514
No!

1021
01:16:54,648 --> 01:16:56,116
Bones.

1022
01:16:58,385 --> 01:16:59,286
Damn, that's gotta...

1023
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:00,587
Okay!

1024
01:17:00,687 --> 01:17:01,989
Okay!

1025
01:17:02,089 --> 01:17:04,458
Okay, I'll fight.

1026
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:05,827
Okay?

1027
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:08,328
Get 'em out of here,
both of 'em.

1028
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:09,563
Stand up, soldier.

1029
01:17:10,531 --> 01:17:11,866
Stand up.

1030
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:13,434
Finally.

1031
01:17:13,534 --> 01:17:14,368
Move.

1032
01:17:14,535 --> 01:17:15,702
Told you he was the man.

1033
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:17,404
God, I hope so.

1034
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:20,073
I'll call the warden
at the Aurora State Prison,

1035
01:17:20,842 --> 01:17:23,744
get his top dog for a rematch.

1036
01:17:23,845 --> 01:17:25,946
Good. Good.

1037
01:17:26,046 --> 01:17:27,748
Now I gotta get out of here.

1038
01:17:27,849 --> 01:17:29,283
All right.

1039
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:32,252
I can't be seen hangin' around
with an evil man like you.

1040
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:34,621
Give me a break.

1041
01:17:35,824 --> 01:17:37,090
Got an image.

1042
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,793
Yeah, I could take lessons from
you, you little freak.

1043
01:17:39,894 --> 01:17:41,795
You're the goddamn devil.

1044
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:53,207
Fuck.

1045
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:57,411
Well, that electricity, man,

1046
01:17:57,511 --> 01:18:00,581
that's a mood modifier
for your ass.

1047
01:18:01,682 --> 01:18:03,450
You can't argue with it.

1048
01:18:07,654 --> 01:18:11,058
Look, man, now you know
they ain't gonna let you go.

1049
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,627
You know that, right?

1050
01:18:13,727 --> 01:18:14,727
I know.

1051
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,165
So what in the hell
you gonna do, man?

1052
01:18:28,008 --> 01:18:30,744

this motherfucker down.

This is my top dog, man.

1136
01:21:49,143 --> 01:21:50,277
No, no, no.

1137
01:21:50,477 --> 01:21:52,546
W... what about the rematch
that we agreed on?

1138
01:21:53,081 --> 01:21:53,881
This is...

1139

What...

1140
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:56,726
The fighter from last time,
where is he?

1141
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:00,754
Uh, well, Chaka here
transferred in three nights ago

1142
01:22:00,855 --> 01:22:04,491
and he killed my last top dog
two nights ago.

1143
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,960
What the fuck, man?

1144
01:22:06,994 --> 01:22:07,794
Come on... come... now come on.

1145
01:22:07,895 --> 01:22:08,996
What the fuck what?

1146
01:22:09,197 --> 01:22:11,431
What in the name of Wakanda
is this shit?

1147
01:22:11,531 --> 01:22:13,251
This is a different weight class
right here.

1148
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,002
He's not right for me, okay?

1149
01:22:15,103 --> 01:22:18,206
This is my fighter, my top dog.

1150
01:22:18,305 --> 01:22:19,807
Take it or leave it.

1151
01:22:19,907 --> 01:22:25,146
Or forfeit, and I'll gladly take
my $100,000,

1152
01:22:25,245 --> 01:22:27,882
and we'll go back to our prison.

1153
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:31,251
You're an evil bastard,
all right?

1154
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:34,454
Uh, evil just runs here.

1155
01:22:36,057 --> 01:22:37,892
I don't have a choice, do I?

1156
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,761
All right, bring book,
let's do it.

1157
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:42,696
Come on. Fuck you.

1158
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:03,851
Welcome back
to the dungeon, family!

1159
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:09,556
Now, now, now, I know you know

1160
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:11,458
that tonight
is a very special night.

1161
01:23:11,558 --> 01:23:14,061
We are here
for the finale fight.

1162
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:17,965
We have our hometown brother
Savage!

1163
01:23:18,065 --> 01:23:22,036
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1164
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:25,572
Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1165
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,441
All right, all right, all right,
all right!

1166
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:32,079
Now on the opposin' corner,
this poser here,

1167
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,580
coming from
the Aurora Penitentiary

1168
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,984
when they got some sweet,
silk sheets night,

1169
01:23:37,084 --> 01:23:39,187
his name is Chaka!

1170
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:43,191
- Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
- Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!

1171
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:46,928
Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!

1172
01:23:53,366 --> 01:23:56,803
Hey, good luck
to your fighter today.

1173
01:23:56,904 --> 01:23:59,406
Fuck you, Super Mario.

1174
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,476
Get goin', let's fight!

1175
01:24:05,246 --> 01:24:08,049
- Yeah! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1176
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:09,984
There are no rules!

1177
01:24:10,184 --> 01:24:13,821

Wooh!

1205
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:31,032
Die!

1206
01:25:40,473 --> 01:25:42,076
I'll be back.

1207
01:25:45,846 --> 01:25:47,214
Let's go!

1208
01:25:47,315 --> 01:25:50,851
Wooh! Fuckin' get 'em, boys!

1209
01:25:51,785 --> 01:25:53,486
We can't have a bloodbath.

1210
01:26:04,698 --> 01:26:06,067
You and the commissioner
assured me

1211
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:07,268
this was a safe zone!

1212
01:26:07,368 --> 01:26:09,303
I have no idea
what's goin' on here!

1213
01:26:09,403 --> 01:26:10,838
You set me up!

1214
01:26:11,005 --> 01:26:12,783
You think that I would sabotage
our entire fuckin' operation?

1215
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:14,075
Get the fuck out of there.

1216
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:15,343
Go, get the fuck out.

1217
01:26:31,826 --> 01:26:33,526
Freeze!

1218
01:26:33,626 --> 01:26:35,795
Everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

1219
01:26:44,438 --> 01:26:45,538
Get out of here.

1220
01:26:45,638 --> 01:26:47,975
Drop the weapon, guard!

1221
01:27:22,977 --> 01:27:24,278
Fuck.

1222
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:43,864
It's me and you now,
motherfucker.

1223
01:27:43,964 --> 01:27:45,698
No, it's just me, motherfucker.

1224
01:27:53,274 --> 01:27:54,607
You're in the system now

1225
01:27:54,707 --> 01:27:56,410
and you leave
when I say you leave.

1226
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:58,112
Now it's time to fucking go.

1227
01:28:14,161 --> 01:28:14,528
You all right?

1228
01:28:14,661 --> 01:28:15,863
Yes.

1229
01:28:22,002 --> 01:28:22,602
You did it.

1230
01:28:22,702 --> 01:28:24,171
Well done, bro.

1231
01:28:32,179 --> 01:28:33,347
Freeze!

1232
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,956
Fuck you! Oh!

1233
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:46,060
You know who the fuck I am?

1234
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,928
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1235
01:28:48,028 --> 01:28:50,297
Look at me, motherfucker.

1236
01:28:50,397 --> 01:28:52,632
I ain't goin' nowhere! Nowhere!

1237
01:28:52,732 --> 01:28:54,268
I'm the fuckin' law.

1238
01:28:54,368 --> 01:28:56,137
You'll be in fucking lockdown!

1239
01:28:56,237 --> 01:28:57,872
I'll be back, boy!

1240
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,875
I am the fuckin' law!

1241
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:03,110
Get your fuckin'... get off!

1242
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:05,112
Get down, get down!

1243
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,516
Hands up, hands up!

1244
01:29:08,616 --> 01:29:09,383
Hands, hands!

1245
01:29:09,517 --> 01:29:11,051
Let me see your hands!

1246
01:29:23,497 --> 01:29:25,099
Why am I in here

1247
01:29:25,966 --> 01:29:28,068
and is this shit over with yet?

1248
01:29:29,403 --> 01:29:31,771
I was able to use the video
on the chip you gave me

1249
01:29:31,872 --> 01:29:33,841
to get the state authorities
involved

1250
01:29:33,941 --> 01:29:35,775
and to bring the corruption
in this facility

1251
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:37,311
to their attention.

1252
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:41,815
And I think you should know,
the commissioner,

1253
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,384
he's in custody, too.

1254
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:45,752
You see it's hard to regulate

1255
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:48,088
these corporate
prison institutions.

1256
01:29:48,189 --> 01:29:50,624
We just have no control over
these private penitentiaries,

1257
01:29:50,723 --> 01:29:53,760
so your evidence pushes the case
for regulation.

1258
01:29:54,562 --> 01:29:55,695
I mean regardless

1259
01:29:55,896 --> 01:29:57,730
of what the men
inside these walls have done,

1260
01:29:58,432 --> 01:30:00,534
they're still human beings

1261
01:30:00,634 --> 01:30:03,037
and they deserve
to be treated as such.

1262
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:07,441
The state has also agreed
to give you a full pardon.

1263
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,449
I... I coordinated
with the secretary's office

1264
01:30:15,549 --> 01:30:18,085
for you to be released today.

1265
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:27,928
Thank you.

1266
01:30:30,598 --> 01:30:31,832
The state has also agreed

1267
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:34,935
to take care of your daughter's
medical costs.

1268
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:38,038
I mean it's the least
they can do for you, right?

1269
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:46,981
Maybe.

1270
01:30:49,817 --> 01:30:51,852
Do you need a ride?

1271
01:30:51,952 --> 01:30:53,020
Yeah, I do.

1272
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,624
Just gotta say goodbye
to someone.

1273
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:57,724
Sure.

1274
01:30:57,757 --> 01:30:59,226
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1275
01:31:08,902 --> 01:31:12,039
Just want you to know
I appreciate you, OG.

1276
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:17,344
I can't even say thank you
for what you gave me, man.

1277
01:31:17,444 --> 01:31:18,946
Gave you?

1278
01:31:20,247 --> 01:31:22,047
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be goin' home

1279
01:31:22,082 --> 01:31:24,784
with my daughter right now.

1280
01:31:24,885 --> 01:31:28,055
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't care if I was alive.

1281
01:31:29,023 --> 01:31:31,458
That's what you gave me.

1282
01:31:31,558 --> 01:31:34,128
The will
to wanna be alive again.

1283
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:36,397
Something that I can't
even say thank you for.

1284
01:31:37,598 --> 01:31:38,899
Just don't forget
about a brother

1285
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:40,601
when you get to the outside,
you know?

1286
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,802
Send somebody back for me.

1287
01:31:44,571 --> 01:31:46,006
My word.

1288
01:31:52,646 --> 01:31:54,315

♪ Bring back a star ♪

1311
01:34:53,694 --> 01:34:57,030
♪ Maybe I'll do whatever ♪

1312
01:34:58,232 --> 01:35:00,902

1315
01:35:10,744 --> 01:35:12,713
Oh God, this ain't real!

01:35:19,854 --> 01:35:21,555
I own it!

1321
01:35:21,655 --> 01:35:23,457

1322
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:25,325
