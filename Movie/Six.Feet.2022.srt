1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,251
(explosion)

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,132
(high pitch sound)

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,900
(scrubbing)

4
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:18,409
You can't see germs, but they can see you,
mingling and scurrying

5
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:22,417
about without consequence
while they silently destroy our world.

6
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,381
(scrubbing)

7
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:27,595
The only way to stop them from spreading

8
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:30,686
is to kill every last one of them.

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,905
Tonight, a new travel warning, now
requiring all airline

10
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,288
passengers to test negative
before they can enter the U.S..

11
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:47,762
In the last 24 hours, 3866
Americans have died due to the virus.

12
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:50,935
Many in the new American
epicenter of California.

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,112
I'd say even
as we go into a Level 4,

14
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:59,744
we will continue to see a rise in cases
for at least 15 days

15
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:03,126
so that numbers will continue to increase
before they turn around.

16
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,346
Hospital staffs are working around
the clock to keep these people from dying.

17
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:12,560
(coughing)

18
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:16,441
This morning, a highly contagious strain
detected overseas for the first time

19
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,034
in England has now made its way
to the United States for the first time.

20
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,709
It was found in a man
in his twenties who had not traveled.

21
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,884
(coughing)

22
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:37,568
We are now seeing so
many people who

23
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,410
are congregating indoors
where we know the virus concentrated.

24
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,999
A lot of Americans
demonstrating the worst type of behavior

25
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,128
unmasked in close quarters.

26
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,512
So this is invariably gonna be
a superspreader event.

27
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:55,981
More than 22,000 people in the state
now hospitalized with the virus.

28
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:59,822
Paramedics describe scenes inside
emergency rooms like a war zone.

29
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:03,494
Morgues and funeral homes are running
out of space to put the bodies.

30
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,414
L.A. County bringing in refrigerated

31
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,878
trucks to store them.

32
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:17,105
(camera flashing and whirring)
An increase in daily cases more than 88,000,

33
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:21,365
America has also just set a one week
record for new cases.

34
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,942
Today, the L.A. County

35
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:43,577
health director said that
ten people become infected every minute.

36
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:47,332
But if you remember, at the beginning
of the pandemic, California

37
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,549
was one of the first
to shut down and flatten the curve.

38
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,010
Where did things go wrong?

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,018
Insects ruled the
skies long before any other creatures.

40
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,356
- If you're wondering
where things went wrong,

41
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:01,861
then you haven't been paying attention.

42
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,744
Look around. Things have been going
wrong for a while.

43
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:07,958
- Relentlessly adapting in shape and function.

44
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:10,044
Nothing could stop.

Your work wife, Rodriguez, she’s

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,679
He's still stuck in Texas. He's
too afraid to fly in a plane.

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,388
I got nothing but a bunch of pussies

62
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,516

63

64
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,319
so, it's just me?

65
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:07,200
- This is your chance to shine.
I wanna see you up on that wall

66
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:10,289
for once.
-  I'm...

67
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,671
It's just, I get swamped with the

68
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,757
the front desk and room calls,

69
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,928
I don't think the
housekeeping is something...

70
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,013
- Take a deep breath.

71
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:21,228
(long breathing)

72
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,190
Okay? It’s just for a short time

73
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:24,944
until everything gets better.

74
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,406
- I don't know how to...

75
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:28,701
I can't do the housekeeping

76
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:32,543
with the linens and the germs
and cleaning the toilets and...

77
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:34,170
and the front desk.
- Okay, okay.

78
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,093
I'll pay you time-and-a-half. Okay?

79
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:38,557
- Well, that helps...

80
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,646
It's not something I'm comfortable doing.

81
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,148
- You wanna shut down?
- I can’t...

82
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,111
- Corporate’s not gonna like it
if we go bankrupt.

83
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:48,577
No motel, no job. Do the math.

84
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,916
- I think there's someone
in the motel with the virus.

85
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,753
I hear coughing through the walls.

86
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:57,968
- What? You've been keeping an eye
on them through the cameras, haven't you?

87
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,932
- Yeah.
- Okay, then there's no one, Tarik.

88
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,769
- I swear someone’s definitely sick.

89
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,565
- There’s no one here that has the virus.

90
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,236
I would know.
Trust me!

91
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,326
Just use the PPE, gloves,

92
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,627
masks, sprays, the outerwear.
You'll be fine.

93
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:20,641
Oh, Tarik, the most important --
Six feet, okay? Six feet!!

94
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:28,322
When faced with stress,
you have to remain calm.

95
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:30,950
You have to take care of yourself.

96
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:32,665
People are relying on you.

97
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,421
This is what it means to be essential.

98
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:42,559
And now it's just me. Flying solo.

99
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:52,451
- Almost 100,000 small businesses have
permanently closed due to the pandemic.

100
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:56,671
And unlike the Spring, there is no help
in sight from taxpayers through Congress.

101
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:00,050
You are your own best defense.

102
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,514
These people aren't
going to stop the virus.

103
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:04,645
Some of these people are the virus.

104
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,356
They don't sanitize.

105
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,943
They don't wear masks.

106
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,697
They don't social distance.

107
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,786
Just a bunch of selfish fucks.

Oh, I... I meant musically. Sorry!

159
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:13,979
- Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

160
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,442
He's good. He's really good.

161
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,448
He's actually a rapper.

162
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,701
(tv noises)

163
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:24,628
Yea, a producer heard him on SoundCloud
and invited him out to L.A.

164
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,424
Cool. A SoundCloud rapper.

165
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,513
Like the world doesn't have enough of those.

166
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:41,117
- Waddup, baby?
- Hey, hey...there’s a guy

167
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,161
- Oh, what’s up?

168
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,248

(tv noises)

170
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,260
- Thanks for unjamming my
log, bro.

171
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:52,306
- Chad!!
- What?

172
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:55,312
(tv noises)

173
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:58,151
- That Mexican place fucked
my stomach.

174
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,573
- You don't have to tell the guy that.

175
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:08,087

176

Association of New York City says

00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,879
it is the worst crisis they’ve experienced.

182
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,760
One of the hardest hit states
during the pandemic...

183
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,392
- On the verge of the most promising contact,

184
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,273
there is too often unexpected frustration.

185

(phone chimes)

186
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:40,736
More than half of the time,

187
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:43,661
the outer is soaky and shrouded in rain or mist.

Tarik, did you clean the three rooms
I asked you about?

194
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,241
- Yeah, of course I did.

195
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,079
- You missed room 222, dumbass.

196
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,124
I just checked.

Wait, I thought you were at the other location.

You're at the motel?

I had to come quarantine myself.

Okay, but are you sure about the room?

I thought I did it right around 10 a.m..

It's 9:45, Tarik.

Come on, Tarik. You
gotta stay on top of things.

204
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,541
You gotta take charge here.

205
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,423
I can't keep checking on every little
detail. It’s the slowest time in history.

206
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:54,466
We don't have that many guests.

207

You're doing a sloppy job like this.

I don't get paid enough to clean up
after these people.

212
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:18,517
Sometimes I wonder if they were raised
like this or if this was just gradual.

213
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,320
Shit! What the fuck?

214
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:26,740

No one’s gonna find out.

Fuck, it won’t go away.

223
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,738
Everything is going to be fine
if you remain calm.

224
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,536
Just breathe.
You have to breathe.

Hi, Tarik, it's Melanie from
Dr. Avery’s office again.

230
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:01,977
Just trying to get a hold of you to see

231
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:04,568
when you'd like to reschedule
your sessions from last month.

232
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,991
Give me a call back when you can, so that we can
squeeze you in sooner rather than later.

233
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:09,493
(phone hangs up)

234
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:19,094
- Waddup dawg!!!
- What the fuck are you doing?

235
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:21,307
My bad, man, I didn’t mean to scare you.

236
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,440
Hey, I was going to ask you,
do you have any AA batteries for the remote?

237
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,985
- No, I don't know. I'll
bring them over if I have any.

238
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,699
- Alright, man. Appreciate you dawg,

239
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,078
I'll just be waiting by the room.

240
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:33,667
(coughing)

241
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,886
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

242
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:43,100
If he has it, she could have it.

243
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,271
Anyone in the motel could have it.

244
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:48,235
They both violated the six feet,
so that doubles my chances

245
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:51,787
and then doubles again for everyone
I come into contact with. Shit!!!

246
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,210
Fuck!!

You selfish circus freak.

Justin Bieber. Fuck you!!

250
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:07,900
- Yes, that is not what I was talking about, man.

251
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:08,486
(mouse clicking)

252
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:10,739
That verse with that hook.

253
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:12,910
(coughing)

254
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:14,999
The fucking bastard gave me the virus.

255
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:20,051
That was the one I agree with you works.

256
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:22,139
That verse with that hook.

257
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,305
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

258
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:25,938
Jay help me write that one. It’s fire, right?

259
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:29,153
I know. Oh, let me. Oh, shoot.
Let me call you right back, bro.

260
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:30,821
Yes, I'll call you back. Alright, peace.

261
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:32,825
What’s up man? Did you ever find
those batteries, bro?

262
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,165
- No!! You gotta leave, pal!!

263
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,169
- What do you mean?

264
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,425
Dude can't smoke a cigarette
without getting kicked out of the motel?

265
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,722
- No, it's the coughing and sneezing.

266
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,103
- I’m sorry? What? Were you spying on me?

267
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:50,736
Fucking FBI looking at you.
- Hey don’t

268
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:53,493
don't touch that.
It's for the safety of the motel.

269
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,332
I just saw you coughing
out in the hallway.

270
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:57,960
You're not even wearing a mask.

271
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:00,714
-  Are you fucking insane bro?

272
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,052
- Hey, hey, hey..

273
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:02,968
What's going on?

274
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,933
- What is up with this dude, Katy?

275
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:07,143
- It's for the safety of the guests.

276
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,272
- I told you I got nothing.

277
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:12,239
Are you deaf? Shit, man.

278
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,867
I’m gonna give you some rave reviews, alright?
- Alright. Okay.

279
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,996
He was trying to kick us
both out of the motel

280
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,834
‘cause I coughed.
- Chad, that’s enough.

281
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,550
- No, he's sick.
- No, he is not sick. He has allergies.

282
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:22,633
- It's probably ‘cause you got

283
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:25,641
some skunky-ass dead
animal laying around this lousy motel.

284
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:28,187
- Yeah, well, that sounded
more like the dying type of cough.

285
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,860
- Dying kind. Hey man,
get out of here, alright?

286
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:33,072
You are stupid.
- Ok, alright.

287
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,580
Look, he, he doesn't have anything.

288
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:41,297
Alright? I would know. He's fine. Okay?

289
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,552
Can you trust me?

290
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:51,191
- We have clear scientific evidence that
they work and they are our best defense.

291
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,870
- The head of the CDC there once again
imploring people to wear a mask.

292
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,586
(coughing)

293
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:04,969
- As blood flows, bitter rivalry has aroused.

294
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,896
As always, the kill is watched
from the shadows.

295
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:13,902
The hyenas identify the lions.

296
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:15,031
(knock on window)

297
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:21,670
(buzzing)

298
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,019
- Hey. I'm sorry about
what happened back there.

299
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,986
He's sort of got a short fuse.

300
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,954
- What's up?
- Do you have any aspirin or anything

301
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:40,747
really? I've just,

302
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,795
I've got a little headache.
- Wish I could help.

303
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,258
I took the last one.

304
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:49,180
- I normally have something on me
and my stash is in the bottom

305
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:52,478
of my moving truck right now.
- You have a stash?

306
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,867
- Uh, no. I worked at a pharmacy
and we got a special discount. Hmm.

307
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:01,666
- Huh, sounds like a good job.

308
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,799
- Are those shot around here?

309
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:12,145
I love that!
- Yea, it’s just a dumb hobby of mine.

310
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,859
- You took these? They're
beautiful.

311
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:23,334
- Yea, there’s just something about the wide open sky
and the sunrise that calms me.

312
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,714
It's like a new day, a new

313
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:29,764
a new life every day, you know?

314
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:33,522
- Yeah. They kind of remind me of home.

315
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,074
So is there like a CVS

316
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,957
or anything around here?
- Nope.

317
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,086
But we got one of them

318
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,593
fancy Rite Aids.
- Okay!

319
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:52,098
Down the 58, exit Silver Queen Road.

320
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,273
It's about 20 minutes away.
- Thank you.

321
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:57,734
I'll see you later.

322
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:00,868
- The daily struggle for survival is a total drama.

324

- Super Six front desk, how can I help you?

325
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,764
- The creation of new life.

326
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:16,021
- I don't know what happened.

327
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:20,323
I was watching the Ted Powers sermon
and it just cut out.

328
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:22,576
- Yeah, that's not good.

329
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,497
We all need God right now.

330
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,884
- You said it right, brother.

331
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,642
We're right in the middle of it.

332
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:37,608
- Of what?

333
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,783
- The Apocalypse, man. It’ll gobble you up.

334
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,001
- Hey, gotchu!!

335
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:51,594
Got your ass. You're a hard man to keep up with,
I'll tell you that.

336
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,723
Hey, um, this towel.

337
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:55,976
It’s getting crusty in here.

338
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:58,608
Someone need you to switch that out for me
if you'd be so kind. Okay?

339
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:02,700
- Okay. Just throw it in the hallway
when you're done.
- And the wifi.

340
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,535
- Six feet, please.
- Yeah.

341
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:07,333
The wifi sucks. Okay!
So that's going to have to be fixed.

342
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,670
Alright?
- I know. I know.

343
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:14,431
- Kaboom!! Good night!
- Good night!

344
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:20,318
Just keep clean, be cool,
and stay the course.

345
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,282
Most of them are only here for a few days.

(buzzing)

349
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:45,742
- Hey, sorry to bother you again, but

350
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,288
I have something for you.

351
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,018
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

352
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:02,316
- How much do I owe you?
- No, please.

353
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:05,157
I got the special discount.
- Special discount?

354
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:07,076
- Mm hmm.
- I should send you on runs.

355
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,288
- Maybe you should.

356
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,050
- How's your headache now?
- Good. Better.

357
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,368
Does your work cover that?

358
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:32,919
- Some, but it's complicated
and definitely not all of it.

359
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,592
- Well, a motel chain
like this should cover that.

360
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:38,305
I mean, there are
probably hundreds of these.

361
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:40,100
They make millions.

362
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:41,060
- It's not that bad.

363
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:43,190
I mean, boss man takes care of me.

364
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:47,993
He gave me a a job, health
insurance, place to stay.

365
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:51,166
And just now, he even gave me
time-and-a-half.

366
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,717
I really need this job, so.

367
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,180
Don’t want to ruin a good thing.

368
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:05,027
My, my dad needs help paying for home care.

369
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:11,456
He got the virus
a few weeks ago. Some jerk

370
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,547
got too close to him at the grocery store.

371
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,801
- I'm really sorry to hear that.

372
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:23,523
And don't forget
to take care of yourself. Okay?

373
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:27,236
I should get back to my room.

374
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:28,866
Chad's probably wondering where I'm at.

375

But. um, if you ever

but I'm not going to go back to my room
until I find Chad. Alright!

473
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:34,601
So I would appreciate it if

474
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:36,230
you would just help me.

475
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:44,581
- Hey, wait up!

476
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:50,133
(door opening)

477
00:26:57,523 --> 00:27:00,193
- Well, there’s no use in
go and look in my room again.

478
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,074
I've gone back to
check a dozen times already.

479
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:10,296
(door closing)

480
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:12,679
- What was the last thing he said to you?

481
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:16,269
We got in a fight.

482
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,356
- I'm sure he's fine.

483
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:20,778
He'll come back.

484
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,114
- Thank you for helping me.

485
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:28,669
- You're welcome.
- I’ll see you around.

486
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:43,154
- The pandemic is straining relationships,
in some cases beyond repair.

487
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:48,957
Divorce rates spiking, friendships fraying, and families
want attention as they navigate

488
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,755
uncharted territory.

489
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:17,015
- Don't let yourself get suckered
in by this girl.

490
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:19,351
She doesn't want you.

491
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:21,107
She wants to be with her boyfriend.

492
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,488
Plus, you have Carolina.

493
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:27,494
You okay?

494
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:36,137
- Yeah. He's just such a child.

495
00:28:37,557 --> 00:28:41,355
I told him that one of his songs
could be better and he flipped out.

496
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:44,571
He just can't take critique.

497
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:47,785
And now I'm here alone.

498
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:03,316
(giggling)

499
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,445
It's a little it's a little cold.

500
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,371
But it's nice, though.

501
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,839
- It is nice.

502

come back positive

503
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:31,163

of 8%. It’s the equivalent of a new diagnosis every second.

504

It's probably just Gus
messing with you again.

Don't fall for it.

- No, no, no. Leave it. Leave it.

526
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:03,974
It's good for muscle dilation.

I'm not really into weights.

All of them. It's a steal.

536

00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:13,752
- What are those cameras?

630
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:17,426
- I told you never ever under any circumstances

631
00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:21,269
allow anyone to see the goddamn monitors.

632
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:23,856
Over your fucking dead body.

633
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:25,902
- What are those cameras in the rooms?

634
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:29,241
- I have to keep an eye
on the guests in the motel

635
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:32,374
for our own safety. It’s a matter of life and death.

636
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,963

going to go now, Terik?

637
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,426
She knows all about my cameras.

638
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:39,848
- No. She won't call the cops.

639
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:43,104
She likes me.
- Tarik, it's horseshit. It's not real.

640
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:44,733

643
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:02,059
Hey, please. I didn't know about the other cameras.

644
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:05,021
- Don't talk to me.

645
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:07,694
- You gotta believe me please!
- Get out of my way

646
00:38:07,696 --> 00:38:09,282
or I'm gonna call the cops.

647

- Oh, really?

649
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,962
I find that hard to believe
when literally all you do all day is

650
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,172
look at those monitors.
- No, no, no,

651
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:20,722
it was logged on as Gus.
- Oh, okay!

652
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,640
How was it logged on to Gus then?

653
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:24,938
- I don't know. He's
hiding out somewhere in the motel.

654
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:28,652
Must have remote access
to all the cameras. Katy, please.

655
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,157
Please don't tell the police.

656
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,617
We'll get in trouble.

657
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,038
They'll shut down the motel.
I'll lose my job.

660

Without this job,

661
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:40,008

-Yes! Chad Baker!!

665
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:56,415
- Can you give a description?
- Six foot brown hair.

666
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,461
- Was he seen today?
- Yes. Yes.

667
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,298
- How long ago?
- 24 hours.

668
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,094
- Okay, and what is your name, miss?

669
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:03,346
- My name is Katy.

670
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:05,603

I think Gus is taking advantage of you.

680
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,963
I think he's made you his prisoner.

Damn, we've actually been looking for a guy

834

matching his description.
Squatting businesses all over town.

835

Absolute lunatic.

Anyway, about your boyfriend.

I've notified the local authorities
so they'll be looking out for him, alright?

00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,624
Thank you.
- Roger that!

Hey yo, Fife! You got some Lysol?

to leave by dawn.

00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:03,042
- Tarik!?!

946
00:58:04,754 --> 00:58:10,221
(panting)

947
00:58:10,223 --> 00:58:13,062
Tarik! Come back, Tarik!!

948
00:58:14,649 --> 00:58:16,567
(thumping of the door)
- Katy!!

949
00:58:16,569 --> 00:58:18,278
Katy!!
- Tarik, over here!

950
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,867
- Oh shit!
- Tarik, come back, Tarik!!

951
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:23,038
- Katy! Katy!! We gotta go out of here.

952
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,457
We gotta go!
- Why?

953
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,169
- We just, just trust me!

954
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,171
We gotta go!

955
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:29,259
- Well, I can't just leave.

956
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:30,346
What about Chad?

957
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:33,645
- I'm sorry. He's not coming back!

958
00:58:34,897 --> 00:58:37,695
- What do you mean?
- He found out!

959
00:58:38,864 --> 00:58:40,868
- Who found out what? What’re you..
- Gus!!

960
00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:45,418
He found out that Chad had the virus
and he killed him!

961
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:51,303
- No, no, he didn't have the virus!
- Katy, we don't have time. We have to go!

962
00:58:51,305 --> 00:58:52,723
- Stop! Stop! Stop!! Chad didn't have the virus.

963
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:55,645
- Yes, he did! I saw him coughing and hacking!

964
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:57,106
- It was his allergies. That’s it!

965
00:58:57,108 --> 00:58:59,446
- Katy, he's dead! He's dead!!

966
00:59:01,158 --> 00:59:09,297
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
- No. No. No. No.

967
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:12,598
- We have to go! He's coming for us now!

968
00:59:15,729 --> 00:59:18,983
- I have his gun. I have Chad’s gun!

969
00:59:18,985 --> 00:59:21,908
- No! No! No! We should drive off.
Believe me, it won't end well.

970
00:59:22,242 --> 00:59:23,242
- Tarik! Tarik!!

971
00:59:23,244 --> 00:59:25,079
- Did you hear that?
- Come back, Tarik!!

972
00:59:25,081 --> 00:59:26,458
- Shh shh!
- Come back!

973
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:30,005
- Why is he after us?
- Because we have the virus, too.

974
00:59:30,007 --> 00:59:33,596
- That’s what I was trying to tell you - The pandemic
has been improving for months now!

975
00:59:33,598 --> 00:59:36,309
- What?
- They found a vaccine!!

976
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:38,023
I don’t have the virus!
- No!

977
00:59:38,315 --> 00:59:43,242
- Oh Tarik!!
- Shit!! Gus!! He doesn't know!

978
00:59:43,785 --> 00:59:45,288
He won't spare anybody.

979
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:46,998
We gotta get out of here. Now!!

980
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,545
- Tarik!! Tarik!!

981
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,964
- Come on! Come on!!

982
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:53,345
You okay?
- Where’re we going?

983
00:59:56,143 --> 00:59:58,270
- Oh Tarik!!!
- Oh fuck! Where is he?

984
00:59:58,272 --> 01:00:00,234
- Hey, the moving truck is out front! Let’s go!

985
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:08,417
Come on!
- Shit!

986
01:00:08,835 --> 01:00:09,629
- Shit!

987
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,595
The keys are in my room. Come on!

988
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:17,143
- Tarik! Come back Tarik!!
- Oh shit!

989
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:18,395

- Let’s go! Let’s go!!

993
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:10,041
I know where to hide.
Give me the gun!!

994
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:11,878
- Do you know how to use it?

995
01:01:25,655 --> 01:01:27,073
(metal rattling)

996
01:01:27,075 --> 01:01:28,576
- Come on, Tarik!!

997
01:01:28,578 --> 01:01:31,793
Come to daddy, Tarik!! Come on!!!

Come on, Tarik!!

999
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:41,687
(gunshots)
(screaming)

1000
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:49,701
(grunting)

1001
01:01:49,703 --> 01:01:51,789
- Oh, shit! Oh sit!!

1002
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,920
- Oh shit!!
- Oh my God!!

1003
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:56,674
- What the fuck is she doing here?

1004
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:59,387
(grunting)

1005
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:03,606
- He! He!! Run!!

1006
01:02:03,731 --> 01:02:06,236
- Tarik!! Come back!!

1007
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,369
- Wait, wait, wait. What is she trying to say?

1008
01:02:17,175 --> 01:02:19,095
(sobbing)

1009
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:24,355
- Follow me, Tarik! Follow me, Tarik!!

1010
01:02:25,399 --> 01:02:27,403
- Follow me!
- Katy!!

I’m here!

1013
01:02:35,962 --> 01:02:40,135
(heavy breathing)

1014
01:02:40,137 --> 01:02:41,095
- Tarik! Come on!!

1015
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:42,391

1019
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:51,702
Oh Tarik!!

1020
01:02:53,038 --> 01:02:58,338
Tarik! You can’t run away from me!!

1021
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,843
- Tarik, help me, please!

1022
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,764
Tarik, help!

(laughing maniacally)
(screaming)

1027
01:03:10,657 --> 01:03:11,657
- What’s wrong?

1028
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:13,285
- Tarik!! Come on!!

1029
01:03:13,287 --> 01:03:15,122

1032
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:21,552
- Come on!!
- What the fuck is going on?

1033
01:03:21,554 --> 01:03:25,645
- Oh, shit! Fuck!!
(screaming)

1034
01:03:25,854 --> 01:03:27,814
- Holy shit!! Katy, we gotta go!!

1035
01:03:27,816 --> 01:03:30,112
We gotta go!! We gotta get out of here!

1036
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:34,203
- Tarik!

1037
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:36,458
I’m here!!

1038
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,378
I’m here!!

1039
01:03:38,546 --> 01:03:39,923
- Katy!!!

1040
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:41,215
No!!!

1041
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:44,556
(sobbing)

1042
01:03:44,558 --> 01:03:45,516
No!!!

1043
01:03:45,518 --> 01:03:48,606
(sobbing) Tarik!!

1044
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:52,572
No!!!

1045
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:53,826
- Tarik!!

1046
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,755
(sobbing)

1047
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:01,967
- Oh Tarik!!

1048
01:04:04,973 --> 01:04:06,686
- Where the hell are you motherfucker?

1049
01:04:08,271 --> 01:04:09,983
Come on and show your face!

1050
01:04:12,614 --> 01:04:13,407
Where are you?

1051
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,912
Where the fuck are you?

1052
01:04:16,162 --> 01:04:18,208
- I'm right here!
- Where?

1053
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,129
- Look closer!

1054
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,882
- What?

1055
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,470
- Take a closer look!!

1056
01:04:27,476 --> 01:04:29,272
- What the fuck is going on?

1057
01:04:32,194 --> 01:04:33,823
- You don't recognize me?

1058
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:40,628
- You're not me!
- No. Of course I am!

1059
01:04:41,756 --> 01:04:43,133
- What did you do to everybody?

1060
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,222
- Mhm, you don't remember?

1061
01:04:47,976 --> 01:04:51,523
- I stood upon the sand of the sea,
and I saw a beast rise up

1062
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:56,157
out of the sea, having 7 heads and 10 horns,
and upon his horns 10 crowns, and upon his heads

1063
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:57,913
the name of blasphemy.

1064
01:04:58,205 --> 01:05:02,631
The Apocalypse is here! This is the end!!
The Apocalpyse...

1065
01:05:07,682 --> 01:05:16,657
(muffled screaming)
(grunting)

1066
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:21,792
(heavy thwack)

1067
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:23,587
(laughing maniacally)

1068
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:24,881
(knocking)

1069
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:25,842
(door opening)

1070
01:05:25,844 --> 01:05:28,223
- Heh. What’re you doing here?

1071
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:30,016
What!

1072
01:05:30,018 --> 01:05:30,937
(smashing)

1073
01:05:31,605 --> 01:05:32,396
- Aaah!!

1074
01:05:32,398 --> 01:05:32,858
(thrashing)

1075
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,459
- Aaaah!!!

1076
01:05:42,794 --> 01:05:47,802
- Dammit, Tarik. How many times do
I have to remind you to clean the goddamn rooms?

1077
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:50,808
It should only be once!
- I cleaned the rooms!!

1078
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:53,898
- Well, get your head out of your ass
so you can actually hear me!!

1079
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:54,860
You got your ass...

1080
01:05:55,402 --> 01:06:04,671
(sparks and buzzing)

1081
01:06:22,707 --> 01:06:23,542
(thud)

1082
01:06:29,095 --> 01:06:36,652
- I didn't. I didn’t!
- Oh, you did! You did!!

1083
01:06:37,486 --> 01:06:38,988
You even killed Katy!!

1084
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:42,539
(laughing maniacally)

1085
01:06:50,137 --> 01:06:51,222
- What's going on?

1086
01:06:53,978 --> 01:06:55,063
Why do you have that knife?

1087
01:06:56,399 --> 01:06:59,028
- You're sick!!
- No, I'm not.

1088
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,115
I told you I'm not.

1089
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,535
- You need help!

1090
01:07:02,537 --> 01:07:04,583
- Did you hurt the other people
in the motel, too?

1091
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,964
- I helped them.
- Did you kill Chad?

1092
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,010
(sobbing)

1093
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:12,222
- You're too good for him!!

1094
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:16,103
(sobbing)

1095
01:07:16,105 --> 01:07:17,439
- Was it a voice in your head?

1096
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:19,236
Did a voice in your head tell you to do it, Tarik?

1097
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:23,326
You don't have to do this, okay?

1098
01:07:23,328 --> 01:07:25,497
You don't have to listen to the voice!

1099
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,334
(sobbing)

1100
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:30,425
- Okay, I don’t.
- Do it!!

1101
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:32,555
Do it!!

1102
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:36,270
Test results don't lie!!

1103
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,485
She's got the virus!!
- You need help!

1104
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:41,320
You just need help.

1105
01:07:41,322 --> 01:07:42,990
I can help you!

1106
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,409
It's alright. It's okay. It's okay.

1107
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:45,540
Just put down the knife!

1108
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:48,002
- Please help me!

1109
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:53,388
- It’s gonna be ok. It’s ok!

1110
01:07:53,764 --> 01:07:55,935
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

1111
01:07:56,102 --> 01:07:58,939
(sobbing)

1112
01:07:58,941 --> 01:07:59,439
(knife stabbing)

1113
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:04,868
(grunting)

1114
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:07,540
(sobbing)

1115
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,166
No!!

1116
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,334
(sobbing)

1117
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:10,965
I’m so sorry, Katy!!

1118
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:14,138
I am so sorry!!

1119
01:08:14,598 --> 01:08:16,850
(knife stabbing)

1120
01:08:16,852 --> 01:08:20,192
(sobbing)

1121
01:08:20,651 --> 01:08:21,737
- No!!

1122
01:08:22,237 --> 01:08:23,697
No! But I loved her.

1123
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,788
(laughing maniacally)

1124
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,959
- That's funny!
- Why the fuck is that funny?

1125
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:32,088
- Oh, ‘Rick, ’Rick, ‘Rick!

1126
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:35,096
She was the only one
who could have come between us.

1127
01:08:35,765 --> 01:08:36,975
And you killed her!

1128
01:08:39,355 --> 01:08:45,200
That's funny. She could have saved you,
but you killed her!

1129
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:48,331
But they deserved it.

1130
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,542
They never listened to you.

1131
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:52,505
Never put their masks on.

1132
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:53,842
Selfish fucks!!

1133
01:08:55,303 --> 01:08:56,389
And Gus!!

1134
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:02,023
That fuck!! He never gave a shit about
anybody but himself!

1135
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:02,650
(coughing)

1136
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:06,574
So dirty!! That greedy bastard
probably had the virus himself.

1137
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,035
You did a favor!! But.

1138
01:09:08,037 --> 01:09:08,872
- Aah.

1139
01:09:09,164 --> 01:09:10,333
- Well,

1140
01:09:12,045 --> 01:09:13,966
I’d say I kinda liked him, you know.

1141
01:09:14,592 --> 01:09:18,559
You know. ‘Cause he was always
pushing you towards me!

1142
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:21,771
Me and you!!

1143
01:09:21,773 --> 01:09:23,109
We're all we got.

1144
01:09:24,445 --> 01:09:30,330
(laughing maniacally)

1145
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,167
Listen!

1146
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:35,050
They all needed to learn a lesson.

1147
01:09:38,056 --> 01:09:40,310
- They did?
- They did!

1148
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,409
- They did!!

1149
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:57,052
- And you did good!! You hear me?
You did real, real good!!

1150
01:10:00,392 --> 01:10:01,978
I'm proud of you!

1151
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:04,358
Now, go clean up!

1152
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:13,669
But remember - Six feet!!

1153
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:21,058
(laughing maniacally)

1154
01:10:23,396 --> 01:10:27,530
(zipping)

1155
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,368
(gloves snapping)

1156
01:10:32,748 --> 01:10:42,768
(scrubbing)

1157
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:25,854
(scrubbing)

1158
01:11:31,115 --> 01:11:32,825
- New hope on the vaccine front!

1159
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:38,335
So far, more than 45 million Americans,
13.6% of the population have received

1160
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:43,304
at least one dose of the two-shot vaccine.
Now released encouraging data

1161
01:11:43,306 --> 01:11:47,022
just ahead of the FDA meeting on Friday,
the single dose vaccine.

1162
01:11:47,105 --> 01:11:49,861
(camera flashing and whirring)

1163
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:59,505
- Layoffs, the financial pressure
and the caregiving,

1164
01:11:59,756 --> 01:12:02,511
they’re all taking a toll on people
across the country.

1165
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,972
Numbers are hard to come by,
but a recent survey

1166
01:12:04,974 --> 01:12:09,692
found that 65% of people say that worry
or stress tied to these outbreaks

1167
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:13,740
have led to at least one negative effect
on their well-being, including things

1168
01:12:13,742 --> 01:12:16,581
like trouble sleeping, eating and alcohol use

1169
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,380
People right now
who are already in support groups

1170
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:24,972
or seeking treatment for things
like substance abuse or mental illness

1171
01:12:25,181 --> 01:12:28,104
are having an even more
difficult time than most.

1172
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,579
Rarely these days do
we get to report on good news about the virus.

1173
01:12:36,746 --> 01:12:38,832
But we have these new studies.

1174
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:42,171
- There's another major research,
not peer reviewed yet,

1175
01:12:42,173 --> 01:12:45,846
but promising which seems to suggest that people

1176
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:49,647
hospitalized develop antibodies
within one week.

1177
01:12:49,897 --> 01:12:53,778
This means that even before
a full recovery, the risk of infection

1178
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,788
to hospital personnel
and frontline workers is reduced.

1179
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:01,588
- The other studies have found
that it takes a little longer.

1180
01:13:02,005 --> 01:13:05,344
But almost every study is finding
that after you've been infected

1181
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:08,390
and clear the infection,
you develop antibodies.

1182
01:13:08,392 --> 01:13:12,233
And right now, all the evidence
point to the idea that...

1183
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:15,072
(mouse clicking)

1184
01:13:15,616 --> 01:13:18,663
You can't see germs, but they can see you.

1185
01:13:20,374 --> 01:13:23,253
Mingling and scurrying
about without consequence

1186
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:25,594
while they silently destroy our world.

1187
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:33,067
The only way to stop them from
spreading is to kill every last one of them!!
