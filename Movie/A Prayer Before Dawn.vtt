If the guards find anyone gambling,

15:32.975 --> 15:39.606

you'll be punished.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.150

Don't fucking touch me!

28:38.635 --> 28:41.805
- I need painkillers.
- I don't have.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.557
What do you mean, you don't have?
You're an infirmary.

28:44.641 --> 28:46.643
I was told you did tramadol for free.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.061
Not free for you.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.063
What do you mean, it's not free?

28:50.146 --> 28:52.146
I've just seen you give it
to five people in a row.

28:52.190 --> 28:54.400
You need to pay.

28:54.484 --> 28:56.486
No, I've got no money.

28:56.569 --> 28:59.155
I've got no money.
I've been told it's free.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.824
You have cigarette for me?

29:00.907 --> 29:02.867
No, I don't have no...

29:03.868 --> 29:06.162
I have no cigarettes, okay?
I've got no...

29:06.246 --> 29:08.790
I have got no--
and I just want tramadol.

29:08.873 --> 29:11.626
This is not right. Give me...
No, fuck you, man.

29:34.190 --> 29:36.943
Eh? Who wants to fucking go next?

29:39.362 --> 29:41.197
Who wants to fucking go next?

33:11.324 --> 33:13.159
You love ladyboys?

33:13.242 --> 33:15.745
You love ladyboys!

33:24.087 --> 33:25.379
Hey.

33:28.591 --> 33:31.094
Yes.

33:31.177 --> 33:34.764
Do you remember me?

33:34.847 --> 33:37.475
I just wanted to, um...

33:37.558 --> 33:40.394
say thank you for the other day.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.314
For what?

33:44.315 --> 33:46.818
For helping me when--
when I was in a bad way.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.407
Okay.

33:53.491 --> 33:57.620
And I wanted to ask as well if I--
if I could get some cigarettes?

34:03.209 --> 34:05.086
Your family put money
in your account, right?

34:05.169 --> 34:07.046
I've got no family.

34:10.967 --> 34:14.387
No family, no money, no cigarettes.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.598
I'm going to get some money
next week, okay? In my account.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.475
I just need you borrow me
some cigarettes,

34:19.559 --> 34:21.226
and I'll pay you back.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.188
I give you only one. This way.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.860
- Which one?
- Red ones.

34:32.947 --> 34:36.492
- Tell me your name, please.
- Billy.

34:36.576 --> 34:39.579
- What's your name, by the way?
- My name is Fame.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.706
Nice to meet you, Fame.

34:41.789 --> 34:43.791
Nice to meet you, Billy.

34:43.875 --> 34:48.045
Uh, can I just get
one more packet, please?

38:09.663 --> 38:13.959
Why is the fan blade missing?

38:14.043 --> 38:16.962
- Cell boss! Where is the blade?
- I don't know, sir!

38:17.046 --> 38:18.964
How the hell don't you know!

38:19.048 --> 38:21.842
Everybody! In the yard!

38:23.135 --> 38:24.428
Someone got killed.

40:35.726 --> 40:37.144
I found yaba, sir.

40:43.067 --> 40:48.030
It's not mine. It's not mine.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.907
Confess, Billy.

40:49.990 --> 40:52.284
It's not mine.

40:52.368 --> 40:55.663
Look. Look, this is mine.

40:55.746 --> 40:58.165
That's mine. That's my top.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.501
That's my top.
That's not mine, I swear to God.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.295
That's not my shirt!

41:03.379 --> 41:05.297
That's fucking not mine!

41:05.381 --> 41:07.883
That's fucking not mine!
Look, it doesn't even fit.

41:07.967 --> 41:11.136
It doesn't even fucking fit.
Look, it's fucking too small.

41:11.220 --> 41:12.972
It doesn't even fucking fit.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.309
It's not mine.
I promise you, it's not mine.

43:23.393 --> 43:24.812
Hey.

43:24.895 --> 43:25.938
- Later.
- Heroin?

43:26.021 --> 43:27.022
Later.

43:39.326 --> 43:40.619
Get inside.

44:13.986 --> 44:15.237
Hey, you.

44:22.244 --> 44:24.496
Yaba?

44:24.580 --> 44:25.998
It's my yaba.

44:31.753 --> 44:33.422
- Huh?
- My yaba.

44:37.593 --> 44:39.678
It's from a ladyboy.

45:07.623 --> 45:09.958
You've got the stuff, man?

45:10.042 --> 45:11.418
Step back.

45:14.630 --> 45:16.715
Fuck you!

45:16.798 --> 45:19.635
Fuck you, man!

45:20.636 --> 45:24.014
Where is your fucking heart, man?
Where is your fucking heart?

45:24.097 --> 45:25.807
You just pay me.

45:25.891 --> 45:29.186
If you don't have money,
the Muslim guys...

45:29.269 --> 45:31.063
just beat them for me.

45:31.146 --> 45:32.522
Smash them.

45:32.606 --> 45:35.275
They're not good for my business.

45:36.735 --> 45:41.281
I'm not gonna beat up
some fucking Muslims, all right?

45:41.365 --> 45:44.076
You're a boxer, man. Don't be scared.

45:44.159 --> 45:46.495
I'm not fucking scared!
I'm not fucking scared.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.830
I don't give a fuck about that.
I'm not scared.

45:48.914 --> 45:52.000
I'll fucking beat up everyone
in this fucking prison, if I have to.

45:52.084 --> 45:54.294
I'm saying to you,
I just need a hit now.

45:54.378 --> 45:58.090
If you fucking give me a hit now,
I'll fucking do whatever you want, man.

45:58.173 --> 46:00.384
I'll do whatever you fucking want.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.906
They almost died.

47:04.990 --> 47:06.241
Take it.

47:06.325 --> 47:10.662
I told you, just beat them,
not try to kill them.

47:10.746 --> 47:11.997
Take it.

48:18.647 --> 48:20.107
Billy!

48:55.016 --> 49:00.772
<i>Family visit
for prisoner William Moore!</i>

49:05.861 --> 49:07.571
<i>Prisoner William Moore!</i>

49:30.594 --> 49:31.970
You see me?

49:34.514 --> 49:35.974
I'm happy to see you.

49:38.185 --> 49:39.603
Are you okay?

49:45.400 --> 49:47.486
I had a fight.

49:51.239 --> 49:54.242
I won. Number one.

50:12.802 --> 50:14.804
I'm sorry to see you like this.

50:18.141 --> 50:19.434
It's all right.

50:29.736 --> 50:32.739
Take care, Billy.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.970
Stop! Sit down!

51:39.180 --> 51:41.391
Why don't you care about each other?

51:43.727 --> 51:45.353
You eat together.

51:46.688 --> 51:48.982
You sleep in the same room.

51:49.065 --> 51:50.900
You do activities together.

51:50.984 --> 51:53.570
Don't you have any sense of unity?

51:53.653 --> 51:56.323
Prison is for men,

51:56.406 --> 51:58.366
not for dogs!

51:58.450 --> 52:00.869
Can't you speak to one another?

52:00.952 --> 52:03.204
Why do you fight?

52:03.288 --> 52:05.332
What is there to gain?

52:34.361 --> 52:35.362
I want to train.

52:37.822 --> 52:39.240
I want to train!

52:41.409 --> 52:42.661
Hey.

52:50.752 --> 52:52.837
- I want to box.
- Go!

52:52.921 --> 52:55.548
I'm a boxer. I can show you.
I can fight.

52:55.632 --> 52:56.966
I need to fight.

52:57.967 --> 52:59.344
Let me In!

53:02.055 --> 53:04.641
Come on, just...
Just let me show you.

53:04.724 --> 53:06.768
All right? Same, same. I'm a boxer.

53:09.104 --> 53:10.105
Go!

53:10.188 --> 53:11.773
Come on, man, let me in...

53:28.456 --> 53:29.457
Hey.

53:34.170 --> 53:36.131
How are you?

53:39.801 --> 53:42.345
Look, I'm sorry about not
bringing the cigarettes back.

53:47.475 --> 53:49.978
I've had a fucking rough time.

53:54.649 --> 53:57.819
And I was wondering maybe if I can
get some more cigarettes...

54:00.029 --> 54:01.656
join the boxing team.

54:02.657 --> 54:03.658
I wanna fight again.

54:05.827 --> 54:08.747
Just give me this one chance, and I
promise you I'll fucking pay you back.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.790
I swear to God, Fame.

54:11.916 --> 54:14.419
I'll prove it to you.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.970
I'll make it up to you.

54:24.053 --> 54:25.805
I'll make it up to you.

54:29.267 --> 54:32.353
Hey. Hey!

54:32.437 --> 54:33.980
I got these for you.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.655
Come.

55:55.019 --> 55:57.355
- You okay?
- Okay.

57:03.421 --> 57:05.256
You fight?

57:05.340 --> 57:06.633
- Boxing.
- Oh, boxing!

59:34.614 --> 59:37.241
I wanna bet. Cigarette.

59:37.325 --> 59:38.993
- How many?
- Two packs.

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:35.466
Two packs.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.177
Come on, hey.
Two packs. Cigarettes.

01:00:38.261 --> 01:00:39.637
- No.
- My fucking fish won.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:43.141
My fish won.

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:45.184
Give me two packs of cigarettes.

01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:46.978
I fucking won, man!

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:48.688
I fucking won!

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:50.731
Fucking...

01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:05.454
The rule is the rule. He won.

01:01:05.538 --> 01:01:08.416
No, boss, this prick is tricky.

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:11.127
Follow the rules. How much did he bet?

01:01:41.324 --> 01:01:42.783
Hey.

01:01:47.914 --> 01:01:49.749
It's from your girlfriend?

01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:52.543
No, no, no. Fighting fish.

01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:55.213
- I won a bet.
- Okay.

01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:57.381
No girlfriend, no family.

01:01:57.465 --> 01:01:59.759
No. No girlfriend.

01:01:59.842 --> 01:02:02.720
I wanted to apologize actually,

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:06.390
because I lied to you about me dad.

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:09.227
Not having a family.

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.562
I've got a dad, I've got brothers.

01:02:11.646 --> 01:02:14.148
They don't know I'm in prison.

01:02:15.608 --> 01:02:16.943
It's okay.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:22.448
- Why are you in here anyway?
- I killed my father.

01:02:26.369 --> 01:02:28.079
Why?

01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:31.666
He beat me.

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:37.046
He was not happy with who I am.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.080
Sorry.

01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:50.161
Put 'em up. Put 'em up.
Put 'em up! Come on!

01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:51.996
Put 'em up.

01:03:58.919 --> 01:04:00.337
Go on.

01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:02.048
Just fucking do it.

01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:03.549
Eh? One, two.

01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:07.553
See and decide.

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:10.014
You... No! Okay?

01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:11.348
Again.

01:04:45.091 --> 01:04:46.342
One-two.

01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:46.026
Seventy-eight kilos.

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:28.319
Hey!

01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:30.988
Fucking go! Fucking go!

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:31.872
Your fight at Songkran
was a fucking mess.

01:11:32.873 --> 01:11:35.709
You will be transferred.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:38.545
You're going to move
to the boxing team cell

01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:41.673
and share their privileges.

01:11:41.757 --> 01:11:45.511
You're the first foreigner to compete
to qualify for national tournament.

01:11:45.594 --> 01:11:48.138
Consider this an honor.

01:11:48.222 --> 01:11:50.724
The tournament will take place
in another prison.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:52.893
You have only two months to train.

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:55.521
If you don't want to represent
our prison, say now.

01:11:55.604 --> 01:11:57.064
I can.

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:00.984
- I wanna fight.
- Good.

01:12:04.613 --> 01:12:06.406
Thank you, sir.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.830
Oh. Wait.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:19.169
From your father.

01:12:37.312 --> 01:12:39.815
Thank you, sir.

01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:51.994
See you later.
Look after yourself, all right?

01:14:56.201 --> 01:15:00.455
When I was arrested,

01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:04.960
I pleaded guilty for my girlfriend.

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:07.587
I got five years.

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:11.091
When I realized
I was gonna be in for five years,

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.635
I went wild.

01:15:13.719 --> 01:15:17.806
I killed three people in prison,
stabbed them.

01:15:17.889 --> 01:15:20.559
Three?

01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:22.477
He killed three.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:25.981
It's been 13 years now.

01:15:26.064 --> 01:15:31.319
Seeing people leaving this prison
makes me want to go home.

01:15:31.403 --> 01:15:34.489
So I joined the boxing team,
trying to be a better man.

01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:37.909
You know what you get
from being a boxer?

01:15:37.993 --> 01:15:41.496
Your life inside here
is better than any regular prisoners.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:46.084
Sometimes, you can fight outside
and see your family.

01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:51.965
Even if it's just for a few minutes, it
warms your heart.

01:15:52.966 --> 01:15:56.219
Me...

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.514
South Thailand and Bangkok.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:03.018
- I killed...
- Two people.

01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:07.314
My family is poor,
so I decided to be a hitman.

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:11.026
Life sentence for a hitman.

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:41.736
You...

01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:44.614
No good.

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:49.786
Yes?

01:22:25.859 --> 01:22:27.110
Fame.

01:22:28.236 --> 01:22:31.531
- Fame.
- Sorry, I'm busy now.

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:33.491
I'm busy now, okay?

01:22:33.575 --> 01:22:35.910
I'm not talking to you.

01:22:38.288 --> 01:22:40.307
What the fuck are you doing?
You move fast, don't you?

01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:41.958
I'm not fucking talking to you!

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:44.460
I'm not fucking talking to you!

01:22:44.544 --> 01:22:46.212
You fucking piss me off.

01:22:49.507 --> 01:22:52.343
You fucking wanna go?
You wanna fucking go?

01:22:52.427 --> 01:22:55.054
You're boring. You're boring.
You're a fucking liar.

01:22:55.138 --> 01:22:56.514
- You're boring.
- I don't lie!

01:22:56.598 --> 01:22:58.683
You're a fucking liar!

01:23:21.789 --> 01:23:23.917
I said fucking hit me.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.711
Fucking hit me.
Come on, fucking hit me.

01:23:26.794 --> 01:23:28.421
Fucking hit me, come on.

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:29.964
Fucking hit me.

01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:32.884
Fucking hit me, then, eh?

01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:37.347
Fucking hit me, eh?
Fucking hit me, eh?

01:23:54.155 --> 01:23:55.281
Fucking gloves.

01:26:19.634 --> 01:26:20.968
Lek, I'm sorry.

01:26:23.638 --> 01:26:26.224
Lek, I'm sorry, okay? I fucked up.

01:26:26.307 --> 01:26:27.558
I made a mistake.

01:26:27.642 --> 01:26:28.893
Sorry?

01:26:33.231 --> 01:26:35.566
Lek, I'm fucking sorry.

01:27:07.348 --> 01:27:08.641
One-two, one-two, one-two.

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.480
Okay, push-up.

01:28:43.778 --> 01:28:46.614
This song is about a woman

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:51.911
who is ready to wait forever
for the man she loves.

01:30:32.053 --> 01:30:33.429
One, two.

01:30:50.196 --> 01:30:52.698
- Okay.
- One more, one more!

01:31:01.749 --> 01:31:03.292
Hey, Billy.

01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:06.837
Money!

01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:10.508
I'm gonna get
your money, all right?

01:31:10.591 --> 01:31:12.718
I'm gonna get it.
I've got a fight coming up.

01:31:12.802 --> 01:31:14.303
I'm gonna win, okay?

01:31:14.387 --> 01:31:17.056
I'm gonna win. I'm gonna fight.
I'm gonna win, okay?

01:31:17.139 --> 01:31:19.141
I'm gonna fucking win, all right?

01:31:19.225 --> 01:31:20.976
I'm gonna fucking win, okay?

01:31:38.411 --> 01:31:39.930
I'm gonna get the money
for you, all right?

01:31:39.954 --> 01:31:41.330
I'm gonna win the fight.

01:31:43.708 --> 01:31:47.378
I got AIDS. You want?

01:31:53.342 --> 01:31:54.844
You lose...

01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:48.230
I'm okay.

01:33:50.626 --> 01:33:53.003
I've got a tournament coming up.

01:33:53.087 --> 01:33:56.632
It's all I've got.

01:33:56.715 --> 01:33:59.552
The reason why you have
a rupture is because of boxing

01:33:59.635 --> 01:34:03.138
and the massive abuse
of drugs and alcohol.

01:34:03.222 --> 01:34:05.349
Any more trauma, and frankly,

01:34:05.432 --> 01:34:07.518
you could bleed to death.

01:34:10.479 --> 01:34:12.523
Look, Mr. Moore,

01:34:12.606 --> 01:34:14.441
I'm sorry.

01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.447
I'll keep me guard up.

01:39:27.796 --> 01:39:30.424
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:44.618
Okay?

01:46:05.068 --> 01:46:06.444
Hello?

01:46:08.863 --> 01:46:11.533
Hello?

01:51:34.814 --> 01:51:37.775
William Moore.
