00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:10,539
But it is simply to allow

182
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,367
remittance of your
compensation agreements

183
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,325
immediately upon completion.

184
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,152
- Of what?

185
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,547
- Of the evening, Master Jeff.

186
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,157
- What do we have to do?

187
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,203
- Simply be yourselves.

188
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,118
That's all your
gracious host requires.

189
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:27,425
- Shit, as long as
we get paid, right?

190
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,949
- You can say that again.

191
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,821
I am drowning in
grad school debt.

192
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:32,692
- Splendid.

193
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,651
And as per the master's wishes,

194
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:37,740
we will be indulging in a
technology free evening.

195
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,959
I'm sure you understand.

196
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,745
Your smartphones if you please.

197
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,879
- I'm not really sure-

198
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,795
- Old school rule, no
devices at the table,

199
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,579
my mother would be proud.

200
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,102
- Kind of refreshing.

201
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,625
I mean, who wants to try
to get to know someone

202
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,497
who's staring at
their phone, right?

203
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,499
Besides it's just dinner.

204
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,415
- Exactly and then we walk
out of here $10,000 richer.

205
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,460
- Yeah, I mean what's the
worst that can happen?

206
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,985
Besides my evening
feels lucky already.

207
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:10,512
- I mean, I don't
normally give up my phone.

208
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,689
I'm somewhat of
an influencer, so-

209
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,300
- Your parents must be
very proud, Miss Cindy.

210
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,127
- Thank you.

211
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,521
- Champagne.

212
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,957
- Are you following me?

213
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,350
- Am I following you?

214
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,917
- On Instagram?

215
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,789
- Oh, no, no, I don't
follow you on Instagram,

216
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,836
but I guess as soon as we
get our phones back I could.

217
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,751
- [Eric] Is an influencer
even a real job?

218
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,014
Like is how you pay your rent?

219
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,667
- Well, I do a little
bit of everything.

220
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,408
I do like, modeling and

221
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,801
acting.
- Okay, so why don't you

222
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,542
just tell people
you're a server?

223
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,587
- What do you do
for a living, Eric?

224
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:44,807
- I'm a motivational speaker.

225
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,766
- Wait, you're a
motivational speaker?

226
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,203
- Yeah, I could probably make
everyone's lives better here

227
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,161
in like five minutes.

228
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,641
You're all doing
something wrong.

229
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,773
- Like what?

230
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,296
- [Eric] Well for starters,

231
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,124
you responded to this
circus invitation.

232
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,690
- As did you.

233
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,866
- Are you gonna be an
ass the entire night

234
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,172
or just the first hour?

235
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,696
- Hm, you know I figured
everyone living around here

236
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:08,135
was in tech or acting.

237
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,050
- I'm getting my master's
in bioengineering

238
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,573
so that's not quite tech.

239
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,533
- So can you please tell us

240
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,622
why there's no surveillance
footage from last night?

241
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,149
Surely, a man as grand
as the one you're working

242
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,933
needs constant protection.

243
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,067
- It is a beautiful
home, isn't it, miss...

244
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,764
- My name isn't important,

245
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,114
but what's important is
you answer my questions.

246
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:33,813
Look just because
your boss is rich

247
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,292
doesn't mean he's above the law.

248
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,425
- Did you say your
name wasn't important?

249
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,340
- That's right.

250
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,646
- Well here I was thinking
nobody was above the law.

251
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:45,389
- What?

252
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,130
- It's my rudimentary
understanding of
this country's laws

253
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,740
that when being interrogated

254
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,873
by police officers
such as yourself,

255
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,440
you have a right

256
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,050
to ask for their name
and their badge number.

257
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,225
Is that not correct

258
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:56,879
or is it you that thinks you're

259
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,273
above the law?
- 2840.

260
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,405
That's her badge number.

261
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,103
- Its Agent Denver.

262
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,540
- Agent Denver, 2840.

263
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,541
- [Agent Denver] Mhm.

264
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,934
- How can I help?

265
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,199
- The CCTV recording
from last night?

266
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,984
- Yes, master's
very clear on this,

267
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:18,858
no recording of any kind
during social engagements.

268
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,381
- And why is that?

269
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,078
- Well, he's a
very powerful man.

270
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,993
Dines with the highest
members of society,

271
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,603
I'm sure you understand.

272
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:29,477
These men and women
value their privacy.

273
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,611
I'm sure you mean
anonymity, right?

274
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,048
- I couldn't say.

275
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,877
- Actually your
guests from last night

276
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
were not from high society.

277
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,359
As a matter of fact, they
were a bunch of 20 somethings

278
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,058
with pretty run off
the mill jobs, right?

279
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,624
- Yes, I mean nevertheless,

280
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:49,192
the social engagement
protocols are the same.

281
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:52,195
We switch off the
internal security cameras.

282
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,371
Who am I to question
my master's directive?

283
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,941
- Okay, so let me, let
me get this straight.

284
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,857
You never question your master,

285
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,904
even when four dead
bodies show up?

286
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,341
Did I state that correctly?

287
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,560
- Yes, it was a tragedy,

288
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,868
but how were we supposed to
know what would've happened?

289
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,304
- [Eric] What about you Eva?

290
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:17,264
- I work for the
state, social services.

291
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:20,789
- Ah, I can't imagine what
you see day in and day out.

292
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,312
- It's not always pretty,

293
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:24,401
but I get to be part
of the solution so

294
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,883
that some bad things be fixed.

295
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,450
- Well, if you're
looking for a broken boy,

296
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,930
you don't have to
look much further.

297
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,239
- [Cindy] Isn't that
like depressing?

298
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,371
- I think it's heroic.

299
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,027
I mean if you're not gonna
do something for money,

300
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,419
you might as well do something
that people respect, right?

301
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,335
But even I don't have
this kind of money.

302
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,949
- Should I be checking
these for like drugs?

303
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,516
- Don't worry, girl, I'll
watch your drink for you.

304
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,390
- Did you just call me girl?

305
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,306
Don't start sounding like a
motivational speaker over there.

306
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:00,611
- Lady, woman?

307
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,136
- Cindy works.

308
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,790
- Why don't we toast

309
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,620
to Valentine's Day and
social experiments?

310
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,764
- Um, the performer,
will they be joining us?

311
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:23,939
Where'd they go?

312
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,767
- Just to change, Miss Eva,

313
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,682
just to change.

314
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:30,641
Now if everybody would
like to accompany me,

315
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,774
please make your way
up to the dining room.

316
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,646
Our host is very eager for
the breakthroughs to begin.

317
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,518
I'll take your glasses.

318
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,172
Miss Eva.

319
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,086
Master Eric.

320
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,001
Master Jeff.

321
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,047
Master Jason.

322
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:45,917
Miss Cindy.

323
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:48,224
Mr. Calvin.

324
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,446
[ominous music]

325
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:09,811
- Well if nothing else,
the champagne's good.

326
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:10,942
- Yeah, it's decent.

327
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,033
- And the help's even better.

328
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,252
- I could certainly
get used to this.

329
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:18,037
- This is a beautiful house.

330
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,648
- Here's to this beautiful
house full of beautiful people.

331
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,693
- [Host] I'll drink to that.

332
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,739
- Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please stand?

333
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,262
Your host has arrived.

334
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:33,008
- Oh, no need for ceremony
with me, darlings, please sit.

335
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,706
- We thought you were
entertainment, no offense.

336
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:38,970
- No dear, that'd
be you, no offense.

337
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,407
Welcome.

338
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,148
Hello.

339
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,454
It's so nice to have you
gorgeous people with me tonight.

340
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,982
Eva, dear, you look stunning.

341
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,898
And look at that
figure, so nice.

342
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,339
It's a shame you cover
it up so much, mind.

343
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:01,645
Don't be bashful around me.

344
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,907
- Thank you.

345
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,170
- Don't be embarrassed.

346
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:08,348
- Cindy, look at you dear.

347
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,524
Look at you putting your
best stiletto forward.

348
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,179
May I borrow them sometime?

349
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,835
- I mean, considering how much
you're paying us to be here,

350
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:18,880
you can have them.

351
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,142
- Dear.

352
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,665
- I agree with Cindy,

353
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,841
that 10K was a
great fucking lure.

354
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:26,975
- Oh, what about love?

355
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:33,242
Eva, surely you must value
love over any amount of money?

356
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,766
- Oh, well it's like
a primal need, right?

357
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:37,942
Maslow and all.

358
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,728
- Yes, primal indeed.

359
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:47,648
And Jeff, didn't you
come here for love?

360
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,305
- Well, I figured I
can't do any worse here

361
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:57,092
than the local gay
bars and free drinks.

362
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:03,142
- Yes, free drinks, of course.

363
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:08,451
[ominous music]

364
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:14,762
Welcome.

365
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,594
[ominous music]

366
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:21,595
Be a dear.

367
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,596
- Of course.

368
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:28,602
[ominous music]

369
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,742
- Each one of you has
been invited here tonight

370
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,483
for this special evening,

371
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:43,138
specifically, you were chosen,

372
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,661
and each one of
you will experience

373
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,010
your own personal
breakthrough tonight

374
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,925
within the next few hours.

375
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,753
There is love in the air.

376
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,581
You just have to be open to it.

377
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,496
- Thank you for having us, sir.

378
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,283
- Thanks, I'm really
enjoying this view.

379
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,330
- That's meat, right?

380
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,246
- Is this?

381
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,640
- Of course, it's vegan dear.

382
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,859
We wouldn't want to
upset your little system.

383
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,687
- No offense Jeff, but
I don't give a damn

384
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,212
about your vegan
lifestyle or whatever.

385
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,040
What I do care about
is making sure we get

386
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,390
what we were promised
here tonight.

387
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,393
- Yes, $10,000.

388
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,177
- Yes, Master Eric,
we must remind you

389
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,832
that you need to complete
your whole evening

390
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,616
in order to receive
your remittance.

391
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,967
- Damn, this is hot. Are
you trying to kill me?

392
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,491
- Please be careful, please,

393
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,449
I wouldn't want you to
get burned on my watch.

394
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:40,456
- Um, so the whole evening, how
many courses are we talking?

395
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,503
- It's not a question
of time, Miss Cindy.

396
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,766
You must complete your
personal breakthrough

397
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,029
and then you'll get
everything you deserve.

398
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,030
- Okay.

399
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,858
- Yes, Cindy, it's true.

400
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,773
You must stay and receive your
own personal breakthrough.

401
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:57,691
All of us, we must all stay
and receive our breakthroughs.

402
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,214
- Well, I pay $100 an hour

403
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,434
to a therapist once a week

404
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:04,306
and I haven't had
any breakthroughs,

405
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,743
but hey, if you're paying me.

406
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:10,834
- And we're here already, we
might as well enjoy ourselves.

407
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,749
- Yeah, we only live once.

408
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,708
- I might as well
have some carbs then.

409
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:16,971
Can I?

410
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,538
[dramatic music]

411
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:21,192
- Of course, dear, to
your heart's content.

412
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:25,153
[mysterious music]

413
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,335
- [Agent Denver] Are you
afraid of your employer?

414
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:38,122
Have you ever seen him
do anything worrisome?

415
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,298
- Good heavens.

416
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,952
No Agent Denver, I'm not afraid.

417
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:43,911
What a ridiculous question.

418
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:47,001
- She never questioned it,
but you're not afraid, right?

419
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,524
So what about the other guests,

420
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,221
anybody there you
were afraid of?

421
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,136
- Perhaps I've not been clear.

422
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:54,008
- How about this?

423
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,531
How about this?

424
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,751
Did your master use
illegal substances

425
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,927
when he entertained often?

426
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,190
- I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

427
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,017
- Hmm.

428
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,152
Friends in high places aren't
gonna be able to protect you.

429
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,155
- We'll see.

430
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,592
[dramatic music]

431
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,158
- We certainly
will see, won't we?

432
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:17,858
[ominous music]

433
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,215
- And last but not least,
a salad for Master Jeff.

434
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,744
- There seems to be
a pink and red theme

435
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:35,832
with the food tonight.

436
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:38,748
- You noticed.

437
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,968
It is Valentine's Day after all.

438
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:43,536
- Excuse me, I think mine
is a little undercooked.

439
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:44,537
- Oh dear.

440
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:45,712
- Speak for yourself.

441
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:46,800
Meat is supposed to be raw.

442
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:49,803
- I can assure you, Miss Cindy,

443
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:53,546
it's all sustainably sourced,
perfectly fresh and very safe.

444
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,418
Absolutely delicious.

445
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,987
- I wish I had my phone so I
could take a picture of it.

446
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,166
- Miss Eva, would you
prefer something else?

447
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,430
- Oh no, this is fine.

448
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,779
- Master Jason?

449
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,131
- Well I think if they
can handle it, I can too.

450
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,698
- Oh dear Jason,

451
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:16,917
you never know what you
might be able to handle.

452
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,397
Just like tonight,

453
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,747
you try it, you
might just like it.

454
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,924
[dramatic music]

455
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:27,318
- I mean, I'd try an
awful lot for $10,000.

456
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:30,147
- You're so sweet, dear,
I'm counting on it.

457
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:31,671
Thank you.

458
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:32,976
- I bet you'd try
a lot for 10 bucks.

459
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,456
- Hey, that's rude.

460
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,590
Apologize, now!

461
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,721
- Come on.

462
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,244
- Apologize!

463
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:42,899
[host giggling]

464
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:47,034
- Master Eric, we will
have a civilized dinner.

465
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,384
- I'm sorry.

466
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:53,301
The mind just gravitates
towards dark humor.

467
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,129
- Oh, it's okay.

468
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,305
The brain is a complicated
instrument after all.

469
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:11,580
- Is there a problem, Jason?

470
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,973
Can I help you with something?

471
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:15,323
- No, I just don't feel the need

472
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,673
to ask a host to make a
completely different meal

473
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,153
for my fleeting diet.

474
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:24,158
- Oh boys, so much
testosterone in the room.

475
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,466
Would you be a dear
and fetch my kitty?

476
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,467
- [Butler] Of course.

477
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,772
- Oh, I love cats.

478
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,557
- You're so cute.

479
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:35,778
- [Butler] Your kitty, sir.

480
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,525
[host sniffing]

481
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,700
- Angel wings.

482
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:48,965
Ketamine, anyone?

483
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,534
- I guess it's
that type of party.

484
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,057
- You're no fun.

485
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,630
The brain is a
complicated instrument,

486
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,982
but it can be predicted
and even manipulated.

487
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,072
- Manipulated?

488
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,597
- Oh, in only the best
kinds of way, dear Eva.

489
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,512
I bet your brain is
already telling you

490
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,339
that the person capable

491
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:18,038
of fulfilling those
deepest fantasies of yours

492
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,561
may be already in this room.

493
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,432
[dramatic music]

494
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:24,348
That person that could maybe
rescue you for a change,

495
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:25,959
even though you've
only just met.

496
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:29,179
- Come on, bro, she
deals with crazy all day.

497
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,313
- Are you saying you don't
believe in love at first sight?

498
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:35,969
- Are you saying you believe
in love at for sight, Calvin?

499
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:40,190
- I don't know, but I don't
want to count it out just yet.

500
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,673
- Oh dear, I think this
might just be lust speaking.

501
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,894
She is what the kids would
call a fine piece of ass.

502
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,025
- Hey.

503
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,113
- Oh, come on.

504
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:53,421
- I mean, I am.

505
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,378
- She is.

506
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:58,469
- I imagine it's rare,
love at first sight.

507
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,952
Maybe people sometimes
throw away all common sense

508
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:05,433
in pursuit of some
forever love but

509
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:10,394
it doesn't mean it's
impossible or crazy.

510
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:12,571
- You don't believe
love is crazy?

511
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,137
[Jeff clears throat]

512
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:19,142
- Sir, I mean, wait,
what do we call you?

513
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,493
- I don't think I'd mind
it if you called me sir.

514
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:26,976
- Okay sir, have you ever been
in love before or married?

515
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:31,415
[mysterious music]

516
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,292
- I was once.

517
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,296
They're not here anymore.

518
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,300
- The host isn't here to
answer your questions.

519
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,303
This evening is
about everybody else.

520
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:52,219
[mysterious music]

521
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,661
Sir, they're not here right now,

522
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,098
but we have six
wonderful guests.

523
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:03,709
- Okay.

524
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:04,710
Okay.

525
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,581
Six wonderful guests.

526
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:14,197
- Sir, perhaps they'd
like a demonstration, sir.

527
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:16,765
- To demonstrate what?

528
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,333
- Please.

529
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,642
[mysterious music]

530
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:29,038
- The insanity of
love of course.

531
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,652
Now which one of you is
brave enough to go first?

[mysterious music]

533
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,699
- Go first?

534
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,569
For what?

535
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:40,920
- Oh dear.

536
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:45,141
[ominous music]

537
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,842
- So these guests,

538
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,626
they were supposed to
perform party tricks for you,

539
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,106
is that it?

540
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,673
That's what you were
paying them for?

541
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,327
- Do not answer the question.

542
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,374
- I prefer not to
answer that question.

543
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:07,076
- So was it sexual
entertainment,

544
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,471
hmm?

545
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:13,735
I mean, we did find an
undergarment in the dining room.

546
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:17,870
- My client will not be
answering that question.

547
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,655
- Her client will not be
answering that question.

548
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:27,357
- And how did you pick
these six individuals?

549
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:29,446
I mean there must have
been something specific

550
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,231
about each one of them, right?

551
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,973
- My client will not be
answering that question.

552
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:36,671
- I prefer not to
answer that question.

553
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,238
- Are there any
God damn questions

554
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:40,066
that your client will
be answering today?

555
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:44,113
- Okay, hey, hey, how 'bout
we just do an easy one?

556
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,680
- An easy one.

557
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,508
- Why'd you invite 'em?

558
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,338
- Now this one's
worth answering, yes?

559
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,996
Have you ever been
in love, detective,

560
00:28:56,996 --> 00:29:00,564
not lust, but true love,

561
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,610
the kind you'd give
your life's last breath

562
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,785
just to be next to them?

563
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:09,660
- Have you ever?

564
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:14,970
- See, lust is a
very powerful thing,

565
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,843
but it's fleeting.

566
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,497
My guests all needed
someone to love,

567
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:23,413
someone to belong
to in a real way.

568
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,067
So desperate were each of
them for a breakthrough

569
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,766
that they RSVP'd
for a circus show,

570
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,552
and my detectives,
what a show it was.

571
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,510
- You were the
ringleader, right?

572
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,903
- Ring leader, I think
that would be giving away

573
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,949
too much information, yeah?

574
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:39,255
So her client refuses
to answer that question.

575
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,561
- Lion tamer?

576
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,997
- Lion tamer?

577
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,390
No daddy, perhaps maybe
I'm just the lion.

578
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,176
[ominous music]

579
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,746
- Sir, perhaps I
could prepare you

580
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,922
a little something from the
kitchen that you might like?

581
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:54,793
- No.

582
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,232
- Sir, you do need to eat
something in order to do-

583
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,755
- Fine.

584
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:01,582
Hmm?

585
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,672
Happy?

586
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,717
- Fuck it, I'll go first.

587
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,112
- I knew you would, dear.

588
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,071
Think of me as your
own personal cupid.

589
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,422
I can give you
anything you like.

590
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:16,945
You just have to
tell me what that is.

591
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,686
- To get laid and get paid.

592
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:20,035
It doesn't have to
be in that order.

593
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:21,863
- Damn straight.

594
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,386
- Of course, who wouldn't
expect such a response

595
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,954
from a red blooded
boy such as yourself?

596
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,609
[dramatic music]

597
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,525
[mysterious music]

598
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:40,664
Let the party begin.

599
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:46,453
Oh lovely.

600
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,677
Hi dear.

601
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,070
This is my friend.

602
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,898
The room as well as she

603
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,857
is free for you to do
with whatever you'd like.

604
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,773
- If I wanted to pay for sex,

605
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:04,210
I would've done it a
lot closer to home.

606
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,821
- Pay for sex, please,
you're my guest.

607
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:08,867
You're the one being
paid, remember?

608
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,999
She's completely free for you.

609
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:13,915
- I mean, I don't know
anything about this chick.

610
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,483
How do I know if she's, you know

611
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,747
clean?

612
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:24,012
- So many excuses after
all of the bravado earlier.

613
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:26,928
What, she not attractive
enough for you?

614
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:29,931
Do you need to see just a
teensie weensie bit more?

615
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:34,327
Love, please be a dear,
take off your clothes.

616
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:42,422
- This is turning into
some "Eyes Wide Shut" shit.

617
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:48,167
- This is getting
a little weird.

618
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,909
- Now could you
possibly find anything

619
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,258
to object about this body?

620
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:55,870
- This is messed up.

621
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,437
I'm not fucking a hooker

622
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,960
in front of a room
full of strangers.

623
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,875
- Oh sir, there's
a room upstairs

624
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,051
being made available for you
if you'll just follow me.

625
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:05,401
- No, see this is what
I'm talking about.

626
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:09,666
Predictable, your heart.

627
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,930
Here it is, it's
Valentine's Day, Eric,

628
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,107
you're single and
yet you won't bite.

629
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:20,329
- I don't need
this, bro, I'm out.

630
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,723
- Master Eric, you're
free to leave at any time,

631
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:24,203
but I must remind you

632
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:26,292
if you do leave before
your breakthrough,

633
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,902
you forfeit your compensation.

634
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:31,297
- Might be kind of hard
on a mechanic's salary.

635
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:32,472
- Mechanic?

636
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:34,387
- Oh, did I say too much, dear?

637
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:38,608
He was probably
trying to impress you.

638
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:42,699
Wait, perhaps we can come
to some kind of agreement,

639
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:43,918
a compromise of sorts.

640
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:48,183
- What kind of compromise?

641
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,666
What kind of compromise?

642
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,103
- Simple, you can
leave with your cash,

643
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:58,411
you just have to do one
little thing for me, please.

644
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,890
- And what's that?

645
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,589
- Strip, just down your boxers.

646
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:04,460
It's more than that
poor dear had on.

647
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,376
- I don't know
what that'll prove.

648
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:09,248
- Oh, come on.

649
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,858
And here I was thinking I
was doing you a favor, Eric.

650
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:12,773
Eric.

651
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,037
Don't worry, we won't
see any more than if

652
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:18,997
we were just frolicking
on a beach together.

653
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,042
It would be just like
wearing a bathing suit.

654
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:26,134
- No, I'm not stripping in
front of a room full of people.

655
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,309
- Why not?

656
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:28,919
- Because it's fucking weird.

657
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,965
- There's nothing
more I can do for you.

658
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:31,879
Show him the door.

659
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:35,448
[ominous music]

660
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,149
- Right here, huh?

661
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,848
What just there!

662
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,633
Is this what you wanted?

663
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,243
Take a good look, you sick fuck.

664
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:51,029
You obviously knew, right?

665
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,595
Is this why you chose me?

666
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:55,163
[host giggling]

667
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:56,599
- There's no need
to degrade him.

668
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:03,519
Hey.

669
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:05,739
It's okay.

670
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,438
It's okay to feel,
this isn't your fault.

671
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,182
- Do you see?

672
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,187
Do you?

673
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,149
Days of chatting,
hours wasted on Tinder,

674
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,629
weeks of meaningless dates,

675
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:29,676
and see these two, they would've
never found the connection

676
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,417
that I just gave to them.

677
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:37,205
- I'm sorry for being a
jerk tonight, I'm sorry.

678
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,687
- It's okay, I've been there.

679
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,300
- Maybe you would've found
this connection all on your own

680
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,127
after all.

681
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,870
Perhaps when you walked
in here, dear Eric,

682
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,875
you already knew Eva was going
to be your future, lovely.

683
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,747
- You really expect
us to believe

684
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,967
that your master is
some sort of matchmaker?

685
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:03,318
- No, you fool, he was trying
to teach the boy something.

686
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,103
- Teach him what?

687
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:09,150
It's what's inside that counts?

688
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,110
That age old beauty
and the beast bull.

689
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,241
Give me a break.

690
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,765
- He taught the boy confidence.

691
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,289
- Oh.

692
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,464
- And he did that by
stripping him down

693
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,422
both mentally and physically.

694
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,076
Once that boy removed his shirt,

695
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,556
he had no longer a need

696
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,688
to hide behind that
disgusting male bravado

697
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,473
he was demonstrating.

698
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:30,215
- So that charade was supposed
to teach him confidence?

699
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:34,132
Showing the whole room
his childhood scars?

700
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,264
Your master humiliated him.

701
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,790
- Confidence is the
ability to feel beautiful

702
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,315
without needing
to be told you are

703
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:44,968
and I'm done talking about it.

704
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,411
- What?

705
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,370
Do you think it's strange?

706
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:58,591
I just think it's
basic psychology.

707
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,810
- You and your basic psychology
can go fuck yourself.

708
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:04,074
- Oh, look at that breakthrough.

709
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,208
Make sure to give him
double the compensation.

710
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:10,646
- Double his compensation, sir?

711
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:11,778
- Did you not hear me?

712
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:14,824
Make it happen, please.

713
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:15,651
- It'll be done.

714
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,177
- Oh Eva,

715
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,964
don't be so upset, it's okay.

716
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:25,444
Please sit.

717
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:26,706
- Double just for
taking his shirt off?

718
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,404
I mean, I can top that.

719
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:37,586
- Darling, don't worry.

720
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,637
See, tomorrow Eric will wake up

721
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,204
a richer and more confident man

722
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:50,164
because you see,
he realized tonight

723
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:53,080
that there was just
nothing to fear.

724
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,517
There was just the little voice

725
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,738
right here inside of his head.

726
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,924
Please, don't be upset.

727
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,061
- You know what, guys like that,

728
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:21,369
really gets under their
skin when you make 'em wait.

729
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,067
They think their money
and their fancy lawyers

730
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:26,113
will let 'em get away
with murder, right?

731
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,203
Maybe it's time we taught him

732
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:30,900
that that's not
always the case, huh?

733
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,729
- So what are we gonna do?

734
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,557
- Wait.

735
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,647
- Alright.

736
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:49,354
- Master Eric, your car
will be here momentarily.

737
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,224
- Good.

738
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:55,403
- Sir, if I might be so bold,
your breakthrough just now,

739
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:57,753
it was, well it was inspiring.

740
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,627
Is everything all right, sir?

741
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:06,371
Oh, of course, I
beg your pardon.

742
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,069
Master Eric,

743
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,771
ah, your car, Master Eric.

744
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,383
- You think she's
worth all this?

745
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,212
- Master Eric, if something
is for you in life,

746
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,562
it will not pass you.

747
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:25,912
Godspeed, sir.

748
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:29,350
[gentle music]

749
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:59,206
[mysterious piano music]

750
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:08,171
- Ugh, I wish I had my phone.

751
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:12,872
I feel like, like
naked without it.

752
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:14,395
- Careful now,

753
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,788
you don't want to give
the host any ideas.

754
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:20,314
- Yeah, this is way
better than Tinder.

755
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,448
- Well, there's
certainly less weird ways

756
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,405
of meeting someone

757
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:28,061
and I'm not minding the
company so much tonight.

758
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:28,888
- Please eat.

759
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,543
Eat my lovelies.

760
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:34,633
[gentle piano music]

761
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,464
Bon appetit.

762
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,249
[dramatic music]

763
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,818
- My, what a show this will be.

764
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:21,419
- No, no, don't look
at me like that.

765
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,985
I'm not stripping down

766
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,726
and I don't have any
interesting scars.

767
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:28,643
Do Calvin next, he seems eager.

768
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,516
- Oh dear, I don't have
that kind of plan for you.

769
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,432
What our dear Eric needed
for his breakthrough

770
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,390
was completely unique to him,

771
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,261
as will yours be to you.

772
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,350
- Well, I'm not really a
breakthrough kind of guy.

773
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,351
- Oh.

774
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:42,918
I'm quite ordinary.

775
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:43,745
- Ordinary.

776
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,836
- Yeah, yeah, I know where
you're going with this,

777
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,447
but I mean you,

778
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,449
you haven't really given
as much of a choice.

779
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:54,408
I don't think this
is gonna work out so

780
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,629
I don't know
dramatically for us.

781
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:00,675
I mean you've only given me one,

782
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:03,112
you've only given
us one option and I,

783
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:07,290
I'm not really into black guys.

784
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,117
- Oh.

785
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:11,164
- What?

786
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,777
No offense, it's
just a preference.

787
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:20,434
We all have preferences.

788
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,392
- That's racist.

789
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,220
- No, no, it's not racist,

790
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,614
my sister is married
to a black guy.

791
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,050
- You know, having a
black family member

792
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,313
doesn't cure your racism, right?

793
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,490
- Yeah and it
certainly doesn't erase

794
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,927
hundreds of years
of conditioning

795
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:38,931
from slavery and
inequality and Jim Crow.

796
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,281
- Okay, so we're
all woke now, great.

797
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:42,674
[host giggling]

798
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,197
- The caucasity.

799
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:48,506
Would any of the white people
at the table care to know

800
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,290
what Jeff thinks perhaps?

801
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,815
- Yeah, it's racist as fuck.

802
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:57,558
- You can't call me racist just
because I have a preference,

803
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,733
a type.

804
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,430
- No, we can't call you racist

805
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,955
because it's not a
preference, it's a prejudice.

806
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:04,173
You've already made up your mind

807
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:05,392
about anyone with my skin color

808
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,525
and how they're unattractive.

809
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,571
A preference would be
not liking my hairstyle

810
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,225
or my taste in movies

811
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:13,705
or me getting to
know you this evening

812
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,707
and realizing you're
a fucking dick.

813
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:17,535
But you made your mind
up already at the outset

814
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,275
that you don't
like my skin color.

815
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:23,976
Of the two of us,

816
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:25,673
I'm better looking and
I have a better body

817
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,806
and judging by your
tired Zara suit,

818
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:31,461
I also have a
bigger bank account.

819
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,812
And judging by your
fucked up attitude,

820
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:35,204
I'm a better lay too.

821
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:36,728
And while you sit there

822
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,425
up on your high horse
with your pink pussy

823
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:40,775
and acting like your
shit don't stink,

824
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:43,430
know that it's me
who's too good for you.

825
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:48,870
So listen, snowflake,
I don't want you.

826
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,834
[group clapping]
[host giggling]

827
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:56,661
- Bravo.

828
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,362
- I'm sorry.

829
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:03,929
I didn't mean to offend you-

830
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:07,454
- Your problem, Jason,
is that you overthink,

831
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:09,891
you overthink everything.

832
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:15,157
I know all about your
preferences, dear.

833
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,248
If you'd follow me.

834
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:21,903
[ominous music]

835
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,743
Master Jeff, right
up front there.

836
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,444
Master Jason, right
in the center,

837
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,881
this show is for you.

838
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:45,405
- Please.

839
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:52,238
These are your exes, yes?

840
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,240
They're certainly
not unattractive.

841
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:58,287
- So how did your master

842
00:43:58,287 --> 00:44:02,770
end up with so much private
information about his guests?

843
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,642
- As I'm sure you're
aware, detective,

844
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,992
there is very little that
is sacred these days.

845
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:11,039
All this so-called
private information,

846
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:12,911
it's very publicly available.

847
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,130
All you have to do is spend
more than a cursory minute

848
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,003
on these young people's
social media platforms.

849
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:21,833
- Mm and did the guests know
that you were on their socials?

850
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,314
- I can assure you, detective,

851
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,621
that everything we
did was very legal.

852
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:30,537
Are you forgetting that
they signed waivers?

853
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,060
- Hmm.

854
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,193
- You know the problem
is they post so much

855
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:36,674
and on so many
different platforms,

856
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,242
it's really just a case
of piecing together
the information,

857
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:42,331
like one would with a puzzle.

858
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,290
- As you can see, I know
all about your tastes dear

859
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,770
and I think I also know

860
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,423
why none of these
relationships lasted.

861
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:50,600
You see Jason's always
looking down the road,

862
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,603
never happy in the here and now.

863
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,257
- How did you find them?

864
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:58,260
- Not to mention they
all look awfully pale.

865
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,046
- That's not fair, I've
definitely been with black men.

866
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,830
- Fucked black men, you mean?

867
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,440
And then you ran
your sweet little ass

868
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,007
back to your dorm room

869
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,879
to confide in your
cookie cutter gays

870
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:09,837
about how naughty
you were, didn't you?

871
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:11,926
Did you feel powerful?

872
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,712
Did they fawn over you

873
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,626
as you told them how
you did the one thing

874
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,977
their mommies and daddies
would never approve of?

875
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:21,980
- You're all ganging up on me.

876
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,243
- Dear, dear, dear.

877
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:26,375
I know this must
be so hard for you.

878
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:32,338
Aren't you just the teeniest
bit attracted to him?

879
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:36,124
You both like to travel,

880
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:38,039
I thought you'd have
so much in common.

881
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,389
Guess where his
favorite place to go is?

882
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:43,088
Thailand, just like you.

883
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:46,047
Jeff even has a little place
there on the beach, don't you?

884
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:50,269
You even drink the same brand
of whiskey for God's sake.

885
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:51,705
- Wait, how'd you know that?

886
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,360
- You should know Jason

887
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,188
that Jeff has never
cheated on a lover.

888
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:57,798
It means you can
trust him, dear.

889
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,019
I know trust is hard for you.

890
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,674
It's not surprising all
things considered, dear.

891
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,813
- I'll take you, for
example, detective.

892
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,425
Haven't you ever been
tempted to cyber stalk an ex,

893
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:17,992
find out what they're doing?

894
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:21,387
It's not hard and
everybody does it.

895
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:27,741
- How exactly did you find
out about the cheating?

896
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:30,831
'Cause we checked Jason's
socials, there's nothing.

897
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:34,792
- It was an interrogation
much like this one.

898
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,663
Oh, don't mistake my meaning,

899
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:38,839
they were free to leave at any
time, they weren't coerced.

900
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,495
I can give you the names of
Jason's ex-lovers right now.

901
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:43,975
They'll tell you

902
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:45,803
that they were more than
happy to talk to us.

903
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,891
Of course, they were
being handsomely rewarded

904
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:48,588
for their time.

905
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:49,937
I have a question,

906
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:51,721
is there anything illegal

907
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:54,768
about conducting a voluntary
45 minute polygraph,

908
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:57,075
especially if they've
signed consent forms?

909
00:46:58,554 --> 00:47:01,166
- No, actually,

910
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:05,300
nothing at all wrong
with a voluntary test.

911
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:08,869
It just depends on what you do
with the information though,

912
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:09,739
doesn't it?

913
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:14,005
- Well the truth can never
be used as a weapon, surely.

914
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:16,921
- [Detective Denver] Hmm.

915
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:21,534
- Well, I guess we'll
find out, won't we?

916
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:27,453
- But of course,

917
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:30,108
this night was built as a
little less conversation,

918
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,414
a little more action.

919
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:36,157
[mysterious music]

920
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:43,904
So would you like
to know, Jason,

921
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:46,341
which one of these
cheated on you?

922
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:48,169
- What?

923
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:49,562
- You see, I know that
all of these relationships

924
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:51,433
ended with accusations
of cheating.

925
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:53,392
- Well, how could you
possibly know that?

926
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:55,350
- But you see, you were wrong,

927
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,571
at least two out
of the three times.

928
00:47:58,571 --> 00:47:59,572
Isn't that sad?

929
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:03,010
Two out of three of
those relationships

930
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,620
might have worked out

931
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,320
if Jason didn't have
an issue with trust.

932
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,147
- That's not,

933
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:13,629
I don't know how you can know
anything about any of this.

934
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:15,022
You weren't there.

935
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:19,200
- No, I wasn't there,

936
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,508
but would you like to know
which one is the cheater?

937
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:25,641
- But how?

938
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:28,209
- Oh, a magician never
reveals his secrets,

939
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:29,036
but for you,

940
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:32,910
I offered each one
of your exes $5,000

941
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,782
to take a polygraph
test, a lie detector.

942
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,611
See, I rarely find people

943
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,526
that aren't willing
to spill their guts

944
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:43,007
about their exes,
especially to strangers.

945
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:47,098
So, would you like to know

946
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:53,147
which one of these
three is a cheater?

947
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:55,933
- It doesn't matter.

948
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,978
- It's all that matters, dear.

949
00:48:57,978 --> 00:49:01,242
What if I offered to punish
one of the exes on your behalf?

950
00:49:01,242 --> 00:49:02,069
Would it matter then?

951
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:03,941
- What?

952
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,899
- If you'd wish to know,
I'll double your take home,

953
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:09,598
right now, $20,000 just
like I did for Eric.

954
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:10,599
- But why?

955
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,210
Why are you doing this?

956
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,168
- This could be your
clean slate, Jason,

957
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:16,649
your tabula rasa.

958
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,259
And after you've done this,

959
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:21,001
you know that you
were wrong twice

960
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,176
and that the offending lover

961
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,918
will be punished on your behalf.

962
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:27,181
They'll never know
it's you though.

963
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:31,881
And then, I can work
on the rest of you.

964
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:34,536
[ominous music]

965
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:44,242
- So it turns out you might not
be as clever as you thought.

966
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,161
You confiscated everybody's
phone at the party, didn't you?

967
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:52,163
- Yes.

968
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:54,730
- Because you wanted everybody

969
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:59,213
to have a screen
free experience,

970
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,172
be in the moment?

971
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:03,087
- Yes, detective,

972
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:04,914
we wanted them to focus on
themselves and each other,

973
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:06,612
not their phones.

974
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:08,135
- [Detective] Right.

975
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:10,790
- Well, we have records

976
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,662
from all the phones at
the party that night.

977
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:15,447
And it turns out one of them

978
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:17,971
was still being used
after you collected them.

979
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:23,542
- I'm afraid that's not possible
unless it was Master Eric.

980
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:24,717
Master Eric left early.

981
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:28,286
- Nope, not Eric, uh huh.

982
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:30,027
Yeah, you took their phones,

983
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,898
but did it ever occur to you

984
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:34,727
that many people have other
devices that can send messages,

985
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,424
for example, a watch?

986
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,562
- Well, I didn't see any
smart watches on our guests.

987
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:45,738
- Well, it turns out
one of the new ones,

988
00:50:45,738 --> 00:50:48,045
they look pretty much
like normal watches

989
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:51,961
and Jeff was a lover of gadgets.

990
00:50:52,788 --> 00:50:55,443
[ominous music]

991
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:06,237
- Look, it's not worth it,

992
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,413
all right, trying to find out
what happened in the past.

993
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:09,544
Don't worry about that.

994
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:10,415
Who cares?

995
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:15,507
Don't be controlled
by money or revenge.

996
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:17,770
- Jeff,

997
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:23,950
I'm sorry, okay?

998
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:25,604
- For what?

999
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:30,217
- For earlier.

1000
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:33,655
I mean no one's ever called
me out like that before and I,

1001
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:36,397
I deserved it, every bit of it.

1002
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:40,880
I hope you'll forgive me.

1003
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,362
Look maybe, I don't know,

1004
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:45,885
maybe I've been wrong

1005
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:47,060
about the kind of
guys I'm attracted to.

1006
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,107
Do you want to get,

1007
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:52,892
do you want to get
a drink after this?

1008
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:58,245
- I said I didn't
want you, all right?

1009
00:51:58,245 --> 00:51:59,855
- Seriously?

1010
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:02,728
- I'm just, I don't
hate myself enough.

1011
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:05,383
- Well, all this back and
forth is just exhausting,

1012
00:52:05,383 --> 00:52:06,775
isn't it?

1013
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:08,429
Are you leaving or not, Jason?

1014
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,083
- Yes.

1015
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,867
- Sir, you're free
to leave at any time,

1016
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,695
but of course, I must remind you

1017
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,176
that if you do so before
your personal breakthrough,

1018
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:18,135
you forfeit any compensation.

1019
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,005
- I'd like to go.

1020
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,181
- Are you sure, sir?

1021
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:21,877
It's a lot of money.

[mysterious music]

1023
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:29,711
- Which one?

1024
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:32,323
- You knew we would
never work, Jason and I.

1025
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:33,715
What's my breakthrough

1026
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:35,152
or was I just collateral damage?

1027
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,022
- Who was it?

1028
00:52:37,545 --> 00:52:39,504
- Master Jason,
I'm terribly sorry,

1029
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,506
but from the moment
you asked to leave,

1030
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:45,466
the host can no longer help
you or answer any questions.

1031
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:47,599
You're done, sir.

[mysterious music]

1033
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:02,527
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I've taken the liberty

1034
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:04,877
of preparing a rather
delicious charcuterie board.

1035
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:07,140
In the living room, if
you care to follow me.

1036
00:53:09,925 --> 00:53:11,971
And Miss Cindy, I
have more champagne.

1037
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:19,283
Don't worry, Master Jeff,
all part of the show.

1038
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:22,199
[mysterious music]

1039
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:43,742
Please, enjoy.

1040
00:53:43,742 --> 00:53:45,309
Who'd care for some champagne?

1041
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,615
- If you know, you
need to tell me.

1042
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,749
- Master Jason, as
we've already stated,

1043
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:53,752
the host cannot divulge
any further information.

1044
00:53:53,752 --> 00:53:55,754
However, he may not
be the only person

1045
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:57,756
with something to share.

1046
00:53:57,756 --> 00:54:00,106
Master Jeff, Perhaps
you'd like some champagne.

1047
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:03,631
- I'm sorry, I
truly had no idea.

1048
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,200
- It was you.

1049
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:09,768
- I suppose if
you'd like to know,

1050
00:54:09,768 --> 00:54:10,812
you'd have to take a seat.

[host humming]

1052
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,651
- Do you know that Jeff
sent several messages

1053
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:24,913
to his friends at dinner?

1054
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,701
They were voice notes actually,

1055
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,792
which means we could hear all
the voices in the background.

1056
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,187
- And?

1057
00:54:39,624 --> 00:54:41,887
- I wonder if you
could explain this.

1058
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,238
- This could be your
clean slate, Jason,

1059
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:47,240
your tabula rasa.

1060
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,763
And after you've done this,

1061
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:50,330
you know that you
were wrong twice

1062
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:52,593
and that the offending lover

1063
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:55,030
will be punished on your behalf.

1064
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,641
They'll never know
it's you though.

1065
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,948
Is that it?

1066
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:02,386
You can punish people
with the truth.

1067
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:03,648
It's not a crime, is it?

1068
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,434
- You want to explain
to your client

1069
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,784
that inciting
violence is a crime?

1070
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:11,308
- Me?

1071
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,180
Can you prove I did
all the horrible things

1072
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,530
you're suggesting, detective?

1073
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,576
My knowledge of the law
may be a little rusty,

1074
00:55:18,576 --> 00:55:23,581
but if a threat was made
and then no one was harmed,

1075
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:26,453
did an actual crime take place?

1076
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:33,591
- Huh, exactly what threats
are we talking about here?

1077
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:37,116
- Oh, none at all, my question
was merely hypothetical,

1078
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,119
yes, hypothetical.

1079
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:52,349
- I, I think I'd like to leave.

1080
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:56,091
I can leave, right?

1081
00:55:56,091 --> 00:55:57,658
It's just, I don't know,

1082
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:59,007
this feels like one
of those nightmares

1083
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:00,922
where I can't wake up or like,

1084
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,098
maybe I'm in the
middle of surgery

1085
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:04,839
and I'm supposed to
be in a deep sleep,

1086
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,581
but I can see the
surgeon and the scalpel

1087
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:09,366
and I'm trying to
talk but I can't.

1088
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:14,501
I just really don't feel good
about Eric leaving like that

1089
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,374
and now Jason.

1090
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,464
- Eva, my dear empath,

1091
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,031
you're of course free to
go wherever you'd like,

1092
00:56:23,031 --> 00:56:24,816
but I assure you Eric is fine.

1093
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:30,909
Would you like us
to give him a call?

1094
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:35,174
I can give him a call
right now if you'd like

1095
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:37,611
and then you'd see that
he's perfectly safe

1096
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:40,832
and also $20,000 richer.

1097
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,268
And then you can be free

1098
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:44,052
to continue your
journey with us tonight.

1099
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:44,879
Eric?

1100
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:45,706
- [Eric] Hello?

1101
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:47,186
- Hi dear.

1102
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:48,666
We were just wonder,
well actually,

1103
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,145
Eva was just wondering
if you were okay.

1104
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:51,712
She thought our driver

1105
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:53,018
might have left you
for dead somewhere.

1106
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:54,585
- Oh, I didn't say that.

1107
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:56,151
- I assured her you
were perfectly fine.

1108
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:57,936
- [Eric] I'm good.

1109
00:56:57,936 --> 00:57:00,112
In fact, I just got to my
favorite neighborhood dive bar.

1110
00:57:00,112 --> 00:57:01,896
You ever been to Hank's?

1111
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:04,290
If Eva ever wants to
find me, I'm there a lot,

1112
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,118
maybe too much.

1113
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:08,903
- Yes, dear, I'm sure they have
perfectly lovely cocktails.

1114
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:11,297
Listen, for the rest
of us, we're curious,

1115
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:12,994
did you check your bank account?

1116
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:14,518
- [Eric] Oh yeah

1117
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:17,259
and I was damn happy to
see a $20,000 payment.

1118
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:19,958
Hey, is there any way I can
talk to Eva for a second?

1119
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:20,785
I just-

1120
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:21,699
[phone beeping]

1121
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:24,702
- See, perfectly fine.

1122
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:26,051
- He said Hank's, right?

1123
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:27,531
- I think so.

1124
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:28,923
Sounds dirty.

1125
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:30,316
- Sounds perfect right now.

1126
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,016
Don't worry, I think
that's my cue to go.

1127
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:36,670
I really do think
I should leave.

1128
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:41,327
- It has been a
bit intense tonight

1129
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:45,462
and I think I should go too,

1130
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,813
but thank you for
a lovely dinner.

1131
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:50,858
- If she's leaving,
my intended date,

1132
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:53,208
then there's not much
left for me to do here.

1133
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,688
- Eva, darling,

1134
00:57:54,688 --> 00:57:56,603
I understand love is
finally waiting for you.

1135
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:58,518
Your car will be
called immediately.

1136
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,694
Who would I be to stand
in the way of that?

1137
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:05,394
And Jason, you've made
it perfectly clear

1138
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:06,961
that you don't want us

1139
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,485
analyzing all your
past relationships

1140
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,095
so if you'd like to
go, please leave.

1141
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:14,752
Calvin, Cindy, I wonder if
you'd stay with me for a while

1142
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:16,405
if I offered you
Jason's compensation,

1143
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:18,320
$10,000 a split
between the two of you.

1144
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:20,105
- Oh,

1145
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:25,589
is there dessert at least?

1146
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:28,679
- She can have mine, I
don't do sugar really,

1147
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,811
but I'm game, this is fun.

1148
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:35,076
- Jason, I did not know
it was you, I swear.

1149
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:37,252
- No, but you knew about me.

1150
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,472
You knew there
was some poor fuck

1151
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:42,649
who's lover was walking
out on him for you.

1152
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:44,608
Isn't that just as bad?

1153
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,524
[ominous music]

1154
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,873
Who was it?

1155
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:52,833
Richard, Steve or Allen?

1156
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,531
- [Jeff] I will not dignify
that with an answer.

1157
00:58:57,403 --> 00:58:58,622
- So tell me about Eva.

1158
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,494
- I already told you.

1159
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:03,452
- No, you said
she asked to leave

1160
00:59:03,452 --> 00:59:04,758
right before Jason
lost his mind.

1161
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:06,978
- So I escorted her out.

1162
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:08,153
- And that's it?

1163
00:59:08,153 --> 00:59:09,546
- What else would there be?

1164
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:27,955
Ah, Miss Eva, I paged your
car, it'll be here momentarily.

1165
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:32,481
I am so sorry about
things getting a
little heated upstairs.

1166
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:34,353
These things do happen,

1167
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,747
but fear not, the car's on
the way, no need to run.

1168
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:39,314
There.

1169
00:59:39,314 --> 00:59:41,099
- I'm just worried about Jason.

1170
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:43,667
I feel like maybe he
should leave and cool off.

1171
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,583
- Miss Eva, some men's
tempers can't be quelled,

1172
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,062
best not to get involved.

1173
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:53,372
Miss Eva, was there
something else?

1174
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:56,810
- I was wondering,

1175
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,986
is there any way I could
have Eric's number?

1176
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,033
- Miss Eva, I'd be delighted to,

1177
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:05,863
but as per your waiver
agreement, I'm sure you know,

1178
01:00:05,863 --> 01:00:07,386
you're not allowed
to communicate

1179
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:08,909
with anybody in the
breakthrough experiment

1180
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,911
unless you made a
joint breakthrough,

1181
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:14,915
which I'm sure Master Eric
would've intended but alas.

1182
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,049
- So there's no way?

1183
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:20,965
- I really wish I could.

1184
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:24,795
But perhaps, Miss Eva, the
universe will hear your prayers.

1185
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,754
Your car should be
here momentarily.

1186
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:28,755
Would you excuse me?

1187
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:32,324
[gentle music]

1188
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,332
- Jeff stopped sending voice
notes at 9:53, why is that?

1189
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:43,552
- I do feel quite badly
about what happened then.

1190
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:47,382
That's about the time
things got just out of hand.

1191
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,558
- Out of hand?

1192
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,518
Four people were killed.

1193
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:56,391
- And you know, technically
that is mass murder.

1194
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:58,089
- How was I to know
what would happen next?

1195
01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:00,482
- Four fucking people.

1196
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:06,358
- Yes, four fucking people.

1197
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:13,844
You will not dignify
that with an answer?

1198
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,672
You gonna let him
get away with that?

1199
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,196
Wouldn't you like to know
which one of your exes

1200
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:22,113
didn't think you were any
better than some black guy?

1201
01:01:26,944 --> 01:01:29,729
- I'm not playing this
sick game, you hear me?

1202
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:30,599
- Who was it?

1203
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:33,428
- Do something.

1204
01:01:33,428 --> 01:01:38,346
- So for the record,
who attacked who first?

1205
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,827
- I beg your pardon?

1206
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:42,002
- Which guest at your
dinner party from hell

1207
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:43,482
killed which other guest first?

1208
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:47,442
- You know, it all
happened so fast,

1209
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:49,793
I don't know if I
could definitively say.

1210
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:53,100
- Right, and you said that
Jeff acted in self-defense,

1211
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:53,927
are you sure?

1212
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:55,712
- Yes.

1213
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,539
- So if we asked your
master, would he be able to--

1214
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:59,063
- He wasn't there.

1215
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:00,934
After I came back from
escorting Miss Eva out,

1216
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:02,370
he'd stepped out for a moment.

1217
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:05,025
- Stepped out?

1218
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:11,336
- Just for a moment, yes.

1219
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:14,469
[ominous music]

1220
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:55,075
- Who was it?

1221
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:56,468
- Why does it matter now?

1222
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:58,035
- Guys, stop.

1223
01:02:58,035 --> 01:02:59,340
- I'll stop when he
tells me who it is.

1224
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:05,042
[mumbling in other room]

1225
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,263
I'm gonna count to three

1226
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:10,656
and you're gonna
tell me who it was.

1227
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:11,788
Okay?

1228
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,747
Was it Richard, Steve, or Allen?

1229
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:16,575
One.

1230
01:03:17,663 --> 01:03:18,925
- Party's over guys, seriously.

1231
01:03:18,925 --> 01:03:20,100
- Two.

1232
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,362
- Please, just stop it, okay?

1233
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:22,537
- Three.

1234
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:23,712
Who was it?
- Guys!

1235
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:26,193
- Who was it?

1236
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:28,935
[mysterious music]

1237
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:37,509
Tell me who-
- Relax, relax!

1238
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:39,076
- Tell me the name!

1239
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:40,077
Tell me who it was!

1240
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:42,079
[glass shattering]

1241
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:46,605
- [Cindy] Call 911.

1242
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:48,476
[ominous music]

1243
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:50,000
- Oh shit.

1244
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,437
- Your butler says you
stepped out of the room

1245
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:54,874
when Jason and Jeff
began fighting.

1246
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:56,484
- Mmhmm.

1247
01:03:56,484 --> 01:03:58,269
- In the middle of
a heated argument?

1248
01:03:58,269 --> 01:03:59,966
- Yep.
- Where'd you go?

1249
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:03,927
- To change, dear.

1250
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:06,930
- Are you serious?

1251
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,367
[ominous music]

1252
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:12,109
[Jason groaning]

1253
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,634
- Call 911.

1254
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:17,027
Do something!

1255
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:20,204
There's too much
blood, I can't stop it.

1256
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:22,380
Do something, please.

1257
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,642
What the fuck are you two doing?

1258
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:25,165
Seriously, call somebody.

1259
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,864
He's dying, help him.

1260
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,345
Jesus christ.

1261
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:33,826
There's too much
blood, I can't stop it.

1262
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:36,568
- Oh, you're never gonna
get all that blood to clot.

1263
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:38,004
Jason's a hemophiliac.

1264
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:39,571
- I can't take the rap for this.

1265
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:41,138
Am I gonna take
the rap for this?

1266
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,748
- The rap? Oh, we're
all your witnesses.

1267
01:04:42,748 --> 01:04:45,185
Right, we all saw Jeff
cut Jason's throat?

1268
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:48,580
- [Cindy] Oh my God.

1269
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,407
Oh my God.

1270
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,367
- You could have stopped this.

1271
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:54,760
You made this happen.

1272
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,804
You did this.

1273
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:56,936
Fuck!

1274
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:58,372
- Jeff, calm down, please.

1275
01:04:58,372 --> 01:04:59,547
- You calm down.

1276
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:00,635
- Jeff, you're making it worse.

1277
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,159
Please calm down.

1278
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:04,901
- Just shut up, just
shut up, let me think.

1279
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,119
- Jeff, stop.

1280
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,120
- [Jeff] Oh my God.

1281
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,383
[dramatic music]

1282
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:10,210
- Calvin.

1283
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,821
Calvin, no.

1284
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,042
Calvin, stop, please look at me.

1285
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,391
- How's it going?

1286
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:19,176
- Calvin, no, no, no, no, stop.

1287
01:05:19,176 --> 01:05:21,918
[dramatic music]

1288
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:28,968
- It's okay.
- You killed him.

1289
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:32,537
- Well at least they didn't
kill the black guy first, huh?

1290
01:05:32,537 --> 01:05:34,191
- [Detective Denver]
You didn't stop them?

1291
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:35,496
- How could I have?

1292
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,107
I had no weapons.

1293
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:39,631
Obviously no superior strength.

1294
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:44,157
- So even as things
progressed, you did nothing?

1295
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:47,944
- I certainly had no idea what
was about to happen, okay?

1296
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:51,208
And when it did, uh.

1297
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:52,035
- Yes?

1298
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,690
- How were we to know we
invited a sociopath to dinner?

1299
01:05:57,344 --> 01:05:59,825
Not my fault, mere coincidence.

1300
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:04,003
- What are you doing?

1301
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,962
Why would you kill him?

1302
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,441
Calvin!

1303
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:09,443
- There you are, Calvin.

1304
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,142
- Oh my God.

1305
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:14,187
- I was hoping you'd come
out to play with us tonight.

1306
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,104
It's okay, you're
safe here with us.

1307
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:22,848
- Did you guys call 911?

1308
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:23,849
- Of course I did.

1309
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,416
- No, you didn't.

1310
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:26,417
- There's nothing you
can do more now, dear,

1311
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:28,462
than just breathe.

1312
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:30,421
[breathing heavily]

1313
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:32,205
- What are you guys doing?

1314
01:06:32,205 --> 01:06:33,728
You killed him.

1315
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:34,903
You fucking killed him.

1316
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:36,644
Calvin, why would you kill him?

1317
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:37,906
Who the fuck are you?

1318
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:39,908
Who are you?

1319
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:41,998
- Who the fuck are you?

1320
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:46,045
See, I don't like being played.

1321
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:50,093
- Oh dear, we didn't mean
to make you feel used,

1322
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,529
certainly not our intention.

1323
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,884
Should we let Cindy
in on the secret?

1324
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:01,539
[ominous music]

1325
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:05,760
- So help me out with
something, will you?

1326
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:11,592
- I'm being as open
and transparent as
I can at all times.

1327
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:14,204
- Good.

1328
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:16,902
Well, imagine you
were me, all right?

1329
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:20,819
And as me, the person
sitting in front of you,

1330
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:23,561
well you know they're
guilty, but something,

1331
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:26,216
boy, something's just not right.

1332
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:28,348
- My client will not play.

1333
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:31,873
- Oh it's okay, I don't
mind a little role play.

1334
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:33,658
- Well, thank you.

1335
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:35,616
- Oh, consider your
fantasies indulged, daddy.

1336
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:38,706
- I appreciate that.

1337
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,882
So something, something's
just not right,

1338
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:41,927
or more to the point,

1339
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,670
maybe it's just that
something's not quite adding up.

1340
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,801
- What would that be?

1341
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:48,238
Please tell.

1342
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:49,065
- Why?

1343
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:53,504
A motive for him
doing what he's doing?

1344
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:54,722
- Maybe there isn't one.

1345
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:58,552
- Well, 30 years on the
force would tell me,

1346
01:07:58,552 --> 01:08:00,337
if you don't have a motive,

1347
01:08:01,773 --> 01:08:02,600
then you don't know
the whole story.

1348
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,427
- Like a puzzle?

1349
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:05,211
- Exactly.

1350
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:06,212
- You think you're missing
a piece, don't you?

1351
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:07,866
- That's because I am.

1352
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:08,910
I'm missing a piece.

1353
01:08:12,914 --> 01:08:14,090

[host giggling]

1355
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:17,876
- How dramatic of
you, I love it.

1356
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,747
- What's that?

1357
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:24,578
- Well, I'm no technical expert,

1358
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:27,538
but looks to me
like a shitty TV.

1359
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:32,151
- No, see, you have 12
state of the art TVs

1360
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,110
in and around the house

1361
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,200
but that is a very,
very special monitor

1362
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,202
designed solely to
receive a live feed.

1363
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,813
- Is that so?

1364
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:44,120
- That is so, tech
guys just confirmed it.

1365
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,731
- Well take another look.

1366
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:48,950
Yeah, it still looks
like a shitty TV to me.

1367
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,388
- You know what it
looks like to me.

1368
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:52,215
- What?

1369
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:54,042
- A motive.

1370
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:58,351
A motive.

1371
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:59,744
- A motive?

1372
01:08:59,744 --> 01:09:01,572
- Did you know, dear,

1373
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:04,749
that there are only an
estimated 20 serial killers

1374
01:09:04,749 --> 01:09:06,620
in the US at any given time?

1375

Our Calvin has a tendency to
fill into his basest of needs

1377
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:13,627
So have you shown up?

1378
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:16,543
- What?

1379
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:20,460
Why did you lie to me?

1380
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,853
- Such a bad boy, Calvin.

1381
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:23,507
- Stop it, you're scaring her.

1382
01:09:23,507 --> 01:09:24,812
- You lied to me.

1383
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:26,510
- I'm scaring her?

1384
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,033
That's not even the best part.

1385
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,732
You know, Calvin here's been
watching you for months and,

1386
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:35,823
I'm sorry to be the
bearer of bad news but

1387
01:09:35,823 --> 01:09:37,303
the boy isn't even a Pisces.

1388
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:39,349
- Who are you?

1389
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:42,221
You lied to me.

1390
01:09:43,831 --> 01:09:46,486
[ominous music]

1391
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:49,794
Oh my God.

01:09:55,016 --> 01:09:55,843
Oh my God.

1393
01:09:58,585 --> 01:09:59,934
- Hey, hey, hey.

1394
01:10:04,896 --> 01:10:07,899
I'd never hurt you, huh?

1395
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:10,075
In fact, I just want to love you

1396
01:10:10,075 --> 01:10:11,468
like the princess you are.

1397
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:16,212
Jeff was, well
Jeff killed Jason.

1398
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,474
What was I supposed to, huh?

1399
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:19,389
What if he turned on you?

1400
01:10:19,389 --> 01:10:22,261
Hey, it's gonna be okay,
I promise, I promise.

1401
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:24,742
I just want to love you.

1402
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,267
I can be whoever you
want me to be, okay?

1403
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:33,533
I can be like Frederick then
with the heart of a mason.

1404
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:36,362
I can work out like that
guy you liked, Michael,

1405
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:40,714
and I'll get you a
coffee every morning

1406
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:43,108
from your favorite coffee house.

1407
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:44,849
Arbeus, right?

1408
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,677
White chocolate mocha.

1409
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:50,985
- Fuck you, get away from me!

1410
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:52,378
[ominous music]

1411
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:55,033
Get away from me, all of you.

1412
01:10:55,033 --> 01:10:57,209
- Hey, we're gonna
be fine, okay?

1413
01:10:57,209 --> 01:10:58,950
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1414
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:00,560
- Stay away, I'm serious,
get away from me.

1415
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,258
- What are you gonna do, Calvin?

1416
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,824
You killed this poor boy

1417
01:11:03,824 --> 01:11:05,609
on Valentine's Day
for Christ's sake

1418
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:07,959
in front of all these
witnesses with your history.

1419
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:09,352
- Stop it.

1420
01:11:09,352 --> 01:11:10,222
I need to think.

1421
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,051
- What happened?

1422
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:13,965
What'd you do?

1423
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:14,966
- Stop.

1424
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:15,967
- [Eva] What'd you do?

1425
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,273
- Eva, stop, let go.

1426
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:20,101
- Shit.

1427
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:23,322
[host and butler giggling]

1428
01:11:31,852 --> 01:11:33,550
- What have you done?

1429
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:34,507
- I didn't mean to.

1430
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,858
I'm so sorry, I
wouldn't hurt anybody.

1431
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,733
- You know what I
just can't figure out?

1432
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:43,734
- I should think
you can't figure out

1433
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:44,996
a great deal of things,

1434
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:46,214
detective.
- The why.

1435
01:11:46,214 --> 01:11:47,825
Like why did he do it?

1436
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,742
- Sociopaths must be
so hard to predict.

1437
01:11:51,742 --> 01:11:54,005
- No see, that's
just it, they're not.

1438
01:11:54,005 --> 01:11:56,312
They're not hard
to predict at all.

1439
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,271
You just gotta know how
to stimulate 'em, right?

1440
01:11:59,271 --> 01:12:01,099
Like a dog wanting a bone.

1441
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:03,188
- It's not my area, I'm afraid.

1442
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:04,624
- My question to you is,

1443
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:06,974
are you that dog?

1444
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:09,716
Are you that dog

1445
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:12,806
just waiting to respond
to his master's command?

1446
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,331
Is that you?

1447
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,157
- Detective,

1448
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:19,639
you really are clutching
at straws now, aren't you?

1449
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:22,163
- 'Cause I'll tell
you what I think.

1450
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:25,471
I think the two of you
invited a sociopath to dinner

1451
01:12:26,951 --> 01:12:28,866
and you just made
an educated decision

1452
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:32,348
to trigger him exactly
when you needed to.

1453
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:35,394
Is that what happened?
- Could you tell me why

1454
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:36,961
we would want to do
something like that?

1455
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:38,571
- See that's what
I can't figure out.

1456
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:40,356
- You can't,

1457
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,269
not with all that wonderful
imagination you have?

1458
01:12:41,269 --> 01:12:42,662
- I can't.

1459
01:12:42,662 --> 01:12:44,272
- Tell me, detective,

1460
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:45,404
is it a requirement
of the police force

1461
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,841
for you to be so creative?

1462
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:50,931
- It is.

1463
01:12:54,805 --> 01:12:56,894
- Calvin, Calvin, Calvin!

1464
01:12:58,635 --> 01:12:59,723
Witnesses.

1465
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:04,554
[ominous music]

1466
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:07,208
- Calvin!

1467
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:11,952
[ominous music]
[Eva breathing heavily]

1468
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:16,348
Someone help!

1469
01:13:16,348 --> 01:13:20,744
[ominous music]
[Eva breathing heavily]

1470
01:14:31,162 --> 01:14:32,424
[doors shaking]

1471
01:14:32,424 --> 01:14:35,166
[dramatic music]

1472
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:07,633
[Eva screaming]

1473
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,418
[dramatic music]

1474
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:13,900
- Eva.

1475
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:17,425
What made you do that?

1476
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:22,430
[ominous music]
[Eva crying]

1477
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:25,085
[gunfire blasting]

1478
01:15:25,912 --> 01:15:28,524
[gentle music]

1479
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,267
[Eva crying]

1480
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:43,408
- Hey, hey Eva, hey, you okay?

1481
01:15:43,408 --> 01:15:44,496
Are you okay?

1482
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:52,722
[Eva crying]
[gentle music]

1483
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:55,115
- [Eva] You came back?

1484
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:57,509
- For you.

1485
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,946
For you.

1486
01:15:59,946 --> 01:16:04,951
[Eva crying]
[gentle music]

1487
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:12,263
- [Detective Denver] Thank
you for taking the time

1488
01:16:12,263 --> 01:16:14,134
to talk to me again together.

1489
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:16,789
I know this whole thing was
quite the ordeal for you.

1490
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:18,965
- Of course, we
just want to help.

1491
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:24,667
- So you came back
to the mansion?

1492
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:26,494
But why?

1493
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:29,323
After the host humiliated
you, you came back.

1494
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:36,330
- There was something not
right about those two.

1495
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:38,158
And when they hung up on me,

1496
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:41,727
well I just had a feeling in
my gut that Eva was in trouble.

1497
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:46,558
You ever have that,
that gut feeling?

1498
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:51,041
- Yeah, it's called instinct.

1499
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,870
I'd probably be dead
without it in my job

1500
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:56,612
and it's a damn good thing
that you listened to yours,

1501
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:00,746
but you brought a gun.

1502
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:03,357
So why not call the police

1503
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:05,359
if you're worried
enough to bring a gun?

1504
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:06,970
- And say what?

1505
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,406
I was at a dinner party earlier

1506
01:17:08,406 --> 01:17:10,277
where they humiliated
me for $20,000

1507
01:17:10,277 --> 01:17:12,845
but now all of a sudden,
I think they're murderers?

1508
01:17:12,845 --> 01:17:15,152
It wouldn't have made any sense.

1509
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:16,719
It still doesn't make any sense.

1510
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:21,462
I do have a permit
though for the gun.

1511
01:17:24,944 --> 01:17:28,426
- Thanks for cooperating.

1512
01:17:28,426 --> 01:17:29,993
We may need this later.

1513
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:32,822
For now you can have it back.

1514
01:17:32,822 --> 01:17:33,649
Don't lose it.

1515
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:39,655
- I mean I just, I had
to get back to Eva.

1516
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:43,310
I just thought, you know, to
bring the gun just in case.

1517
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,573
All right, that place
was sketchy as hell.

1518
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:51,841
When I got there, heard
screams, her screams.

1519
01:17:52,624 --> 01:17:54,670
- I...

1520
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,627
- So I ran to them.

1521
01:17:57,237 --> 01:17:59,109
My heart just kind of took over.

1522
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:01,720
I didn't want to hurt
Calvin or anything,

1523
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,982
all right I really didn't,

1524
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:06,246
but there wasn't another option.

1525
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:09,032
- I understand.

1526
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:13,166
I don't think you have
anything to worry about,

1527
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:16,082
seems like pretty cut
and dry self-defense.

1528
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,654
Eva, I know this is difficult,

1529
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:28,573
but do you remember
anything else?

1530
01:18:28,573 --> 01:18:30,444
Anything that could help us

1531
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:33,056
piece together who these men
are and what they wanted?

1532
01:18:35,188 --> 01:18:39,715
- I've racked my brain trying
to think of anything else but,

1533
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:46,112
I was gone for probably 15
minutes waiting for that car.

1534
01:18:48,245 --> 01:18:49,725
When I got back,

1535
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:56,035
the host, it was like
a different person.

1536
01:18:58,298 --> 01:19:00,387
I can verify what Eric
was saying though,

1537
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:02,912
at least about,

1538
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:05,392
about the stuff when
I was in the room.

1539
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,095
You know what?

1540
01:19:14,662 --> 01:19:15,663
I didn't mean to-

1541
01:19:15,663 --> 01:19:16,490
- Honey, that's enough.

1542
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:23,628
- It's okay, the brain
takes over in these moments,

1543
01:19:23,628 --> 01:19:25,456
it's fight or flight

1544
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,675
and your fight instinct
told you to get that knife.

1545
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:29,503
- Look, she needs her rest.

1546
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:31,201
- Sure.

1547
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:34,073
It might have saved your life.

1548
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,641
You did good.

1549
01:19:38,556 --> 01:19:39,383
Don't worry.

1550
01:19:41,515 --> 01:19:43,039
We're gonna untangle this mess.

1551
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:55,529
Don't let him leave.

1552
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:07,411
- Thank God that's over.

1553
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,377
- Hey,

1554
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,557
how did you know
I was in the room?

1555
01:20:24,558 --> 01:20:25,821
- What do you mean?

1556
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:28,519
- I wasn't screaming.

1557
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:32,001
- Well, I heard something.

1558
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:35,221
You're just tired.

1559
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:36,483
You need to get some rest, okay?

1560
01:20:39,051 --> 01:20:40,531
Just let me take care of you.

1561
01:20:57,678 --> 01:21:01,639
- So I got four dead kids
and two traumatized for life.

1562
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:04,685
Then there's you
and your butler.

1563
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:07,993
And you know you don't have
to actually pull the trigger

1564
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,386
to be a murderer,
right, you know that?

1565
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:15,348
- Surely the serial killer
wanted in one, two, three states

1566
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:17,568
is your first suspect.

1567
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,309
I don't want to tell you how
to do your jobs detectives,

1568
01:21:19,309 --> 01:21:21,528
but for me it's
just an obvious now.

1569
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:25,228
- I'm sorry, what
did you just say?

1570
01:21:27,056 --> 01:21:30,798
- Calvin, I heard the
lady cop over there

1571
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:32,931
say that Calvin was
a serial killer.

1572
01:21:34,759 --> 01:21:37,501
- No, you just said he was
wanted in three states.

1573
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:39,242
- Calvin told us.

1574
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:40,721
When things got violent,

1575
01:21:40,721 --> 01:21:42,158
he told us he was
wanted in three states.

1576
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:46,118
- See but you
didn't mention that.

1577
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:49,992
You said he attacked Jeff to
protect Cindy, is that right?

1578
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:51,515
- Yes, that's what I said.

1579
01:21:51,515 --> 01:21:53,560
There was also a lot
of other shit going on.

1580
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,214
It just must have
slipped my mind.

1581
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,695
- Right.

1582
01:21:59,871 --> 01:22:01,177
- Let's talk about Calvin.

1583
01:22:02,569 --> 01:22:06,269
He was wanted, right,
in three states?

1584
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:09,663
- I'm not sure I would
know that information.

1585
01:22:09,663 --> 01:22:12,579
- I don't think I need to
tell you this at this point,

1586
01:22:12,579 --> 01:22:15,713
but your buddy has
thrown you to the wolves,

1587
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,936
but you can still save yourself,

1588
01:22:22,024 --> 01:22:23,721
we can make a deal.

1589
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:28,726
Why don't you just tell us
everything that happened

1590
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:31,729
and we'll call the DA?

1591
01:22:33,035 --> 01:22:34,732
- Detective, all we did

1592
01:22:34,732 --> 01:22:37,474
was host a Valentine's
Day dinner party

1593
01:22:37,474 --> 01:22:41,260
and we told our
young impressionable
guests some truths.

1594
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,045
But you know what
the real truth is?

1595
01:22:44,307 --> 01:22:45,264
Love hurts.

1596
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,267
- Copy that.

1597
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:55,492
Sorry, detective, but
we just got a call.

1598
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:56,928
- [Detective Denver] From who?

1599
01:22:58,538 --> 01:23:00,192
- The DA.

1600
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:01,237
- How is Charlie?

1601
01:23:02,325 --> 01:23:04,370
- But he hasn't made a deal yet.

1602
01:23:05,937 --> 01:23:06,807
- Not for a deal.

1603
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:12,291
Turns out we are to suspend
interviews immediately.

1604
01:23:14,772 --> 01:23:17,688
[mysterious music]

1605
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:21,735
- Friends in high places.

1606
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:31,310
- I wanted to say thank you.

1607
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:35,053
- For what?

1608
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:41,407
- For coming back, saving me.

1609
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:44,932
[gentle music]

1610
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,428
- I'll always be here for you.

1611
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,259
You need to get some rest.

1612
01:24:27,975 --> 01:24:29,716
- Will you be here
when I wake up?

1613
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:31,805
- I will.

1614
01:24:41,772 --> 01:24:42,903
I always will.

1615
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:54,741
- Look I wish I had more
but that's all I got.

1616
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:56,569
The DA said we gotta let him go.

1617
01:24:58,049 --> 01:24:59,920
- Well what kind of
bureaucratic bullshit.

1618
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,488
- That guy's just seized
Calvin Thompson's laptop.

1619
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:04,534
Thousands of pictures
of Cindy Bellshaw,

1620
01:25:04,534 --> 01:25:06,753
the gym, coffee shop,

1621
01:25:06,753 --> 01:25:08,277
this guy had been
stalking her for months.

1622
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:10,975
- He knew, he knew
he'd been caught

1623
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:12,107
'cause I asked him about Calvin

1624
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,717
being wanted in three states.

1625
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:15,936
- He was wanted in five states.

1626
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:16,937
- I know.

1627
01:25:16,937 --> 01:25:18,113
- Well I'll tell you,

1628
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,679
they've been researching Calvin

1629
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,725
probably for months
prior to the dinner.

1630
01:25:21,725 --> 01:25:22,900
I'll tell you another thing,

1631
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,728
if Calvin's ever admitted

1632
01:25:24,728 --> 01:25:27,644
how many states he was wanted
in, he would've said five.

1633
01:25:27,644 --> 01:25:28,514
- They fucked up.

1634
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:33,084
They fucked up and now the DA
says we have to let them go.

1635
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:34,477
What kind of justice is that?

1636
01:25:39,482 --> 01:25:41,571
- Detective, you know
you have no right

1637
01:25:41,571 --> 01:25:43,138
speaking to our client.

1638
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,878
- Oh, it's quite all right.

1639
01:25:44,878 --> 01:25:46,358
You know we're innocent
now, don't they?

1640
01:25:46,358 --> 01:25:48,752
- No, we know you did it.

1641
01:25:48,752 --> 01:25:50,971
We know you're responsible
for those kids' deaths

1642
01:25:50,971 --> 01:25:52,582
and that you pulled
the strings somehow

1643
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:54,453
and we're gonna prove it.

1644
01:25:54,453 --> 01:25:57,021
We'll get a break,
you just wait.

1645
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:59,066
- Master, I do wonder,

1646
01:25:59,066 --> 01:26:00,372
perhaps we should
invite the detectives

1647
01:26:00,372 --> 01:26:02,026
over for dinner sometime.

1648
01:26:02,026 --> 01:26:02,896
- Perhaps.

1649
01:26:04,637 --> 01:26:05,725
- Detectives.

1650
01:26:17,476 --> 01:26:19,609
- [Man] Eva.

1651
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:20,784
Eva!

1652
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:21,611
Murderer!

1653
01:26:23,961 --> 01:26:27,660
- [Nurse] Dr.
Remington, dial 2226.

1654
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:29,314
- Can I help you guys?
- No.

1655
01:26:31,098 --> 01:26:33,405
- Oh, we're here just visiting
an old friend, thank you.

1656
01:26:33,405 --> 01:26:37,279
[mysterious music]

1657
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:48,725
- I hope everything
was as ordered, sir.

1658
01:26:48,725 --> 01:26:50,553
- You've done well.

1659
01:26:50,553 --> 01:26:52,903
You're really not
a half a bad actor.

1660
01:26:52,903 --> 01:26:55,340
I'm lucky to have such
great talent at my disposal.

1661
01:26:56,863 --> 01:26:59,039
Oh yeah, of course.

1662
01:27:02,565 --> 01:27:03,566
They're still there.

1663
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:07,091
But I'd get there sooner rather
than later if I were you.

1664
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:08,223
- My family had nothing
to do with this,

1665
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,268
you fucking monster.

1666
01:27:10,268 --> 01:27:12,227
- I just needed the insurance

1667
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,403
to make sure you were
on top of your game.

1668
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:16,318
- Was everything
as expected, sir?

1669
01:27:16,318 --> 01:27:19,190
- Oh yeah, played out perfectly.

1670
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:20,191
- Wonderful.

1671
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:20,974
- And he was right,

1672
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:24,282
she was just a girl
who needed to be saved.

1673
01:27:24,282 --> 01:27:25,588
The things we do for love.

1674
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:27,807
- Indeed, sir.

1675
01:27:31,985 --> 01:27:32,812
Be a good boy.

1676
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:36,947
[mysterious music]

1677
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:46,217
- For Eva.

1678
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:49,046
- Aw, I almost forgot.

1679
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:52,615
Happy belated Valentine's Day.

1680
01:27:54,704 --> 01:27:55,531
You can go now.

1681
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:08,587
- Enjoy the rest of
your evening, sir.

1682
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:10,807
- I think I will.

1683
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:13,462
