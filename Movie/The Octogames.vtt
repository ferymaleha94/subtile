WEBVTT

00:24.315 --> 00:25.441
I was watching videos on the

00:25.442 --> 00:28.778
internet the other night,
I like to stay educated, you know?

00:29.404 --> 00:31.947
And I saw this one about octopuses.

00:31.948 --> 00:36.035
Turns out
they have mini brains in each of their

00:36.036 --> 00:39.706
eight legs, allowing them to act
independently of one another.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.793
And that gave me an idea.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.630
The OctoGames,

00:48.631 --> 00:51.926
eight games, eight players, one winner,

00:52.635 --> 00:54.721
each player acts independently,

00:55.472 --> 00:58.016
but are all part of the same game.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.728
My game, my totally sick.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.187
Totally epic.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.231
Totally awesome game.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.944
How sick is that, bro?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.447
Oh, that's harsh

01:13.448 --> 01:14.783
Can you turn that down.

01:21.956 --> 01:22.582
Name?

01:23.875 --> 01:24.959
Carrie Miller.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.213
Okay, sign here.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.675
What's a place this big doing
in the middle of nowhere?

01:33.009 --> 01:34.636
It's JaxPro's studio.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.639
Wow, okay!

01:41.267 --> 01:43.977
Oh, your devices, please.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.062
Oh, uh...

01:45.063 --> 01:46.773
We'll return them to you
at the end of the games.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.067
OK. Yeah, I get that

01:51.027 --> 01:51.861
this way.

01:51.945 --> 01:52.611
Alright.

01:52.612 --> 01:53.571
Thanks.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.088
Have y'all seen JaxPro yet?

02:13.591 --> 02:15.635
Don't bother, he barely talked to me.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.637
I'm focused.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.013
That prize is mine.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.723
We don't even know what it is yet.

02:21.724 --> 02:24.811
JaxPro is running this,
so it's going to be huge.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.355
Maxine, I'm a comedian.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.524
Carrie, I'm a singer songwriter.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.483
It's nice to meet you.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.069
Nice to meet you.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.403
Oh my gosh.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.990
Aren't you so excited?
We get to be in the new JaxPro video.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.117
I'm just here to get more followers.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.078
Okay.

02:42.954 --> 02:43.662
What do you think?

02:43.663 --> 02:44.913
Oh, I'm going to win this.

02:44.914 --> 02:45.664
Is that so?

02:45.665 --> 02:47.333
Yeah. How hard can it be?

02:50.086 --> 02:51.545
Walt Brentwood. Entrepreneur.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.297
Carrie.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.508
You look like you'd be great

02:56.509 --> 02:57.677
at selling real estate.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.471
What?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.486
Hey, Moneybags.

03:16.487 --> 03:17.822
Switch with me.

03:20.033 --> 03:20.825
Who, me?

03:27.749 --> 03:28.999
What's up, guys?

03:29.000 --> 03:33.087
My name is JaxPro, and welcome
to game one of the OctoGames.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.344
I hope you all found everything OK.

03:40.345 --> 03:44.057
You have each been invited here due
to your promising social media presence.

03:44.599 --> 03:49.187
This is the first of eight games
and only eight of you will move forward.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.607
Now you've probably seen
the room is full of cameras.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.650
Once the games are over,

03:54.651 --> 03:58.529
everything will be uploaded to my channel
for the world to see.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.948
What's the prize?

04:00.949 --> 04:03.158
Well, I was going to wait
until after the first game

04:03.159 --> 04:04.368
to say but.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.620
Oh, come on!

04:05.703 --> 04:06.955
Boo! Come on!

04:08.206 --> 04:09.207
All right.

04:09.374 --> 04:13.211
After the games,
I'll be retiring from social media.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.837
Wait, what? You can't!

04:15.838 --> 04:16.964
Whoa whoa! It's OK.

04:16.965 --> 04:21.969
It's all right because the winner
is going to win all of my social media

04:21.970 --> 04:27.349
accounts, my sponsorships
and my one hundred and fifteen

04:27.350 --> 04:28.476
million followers.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.106
So let's not waste any time.

04:34.107 --> 04:38.611
The first game is, Simon Says.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.738
Simon Says like the kids game?

04:41.739 --> 04:43.032
The game is simple.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.078
All players must obey
any command, beginning with the words.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.748
"Simon Says", If I say,
"Simon Says take a step"

04:51.749 --> 04:53.501
then all players must take a step.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.421
But if I say "jump" without saying,
"Simon Says" first

04:57.422 --> 04:59.465
the players must not jump.

05:00.133 --> 05:05.221
If you do a command without "Simon Says"
in front of it, you'll be eliminated.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.058
The last eight
standing will move on to Game two.

05:09.976 --> 05:10.518
Good luck.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.731
This is the Eliminator.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.608
He will escort the losers out.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.781
You've gotta be kidding me!

05:25.908 --> 05:27.952
What is he,
like a dog or something?

05:42.300 --> 05:43.926
Simon says.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.471
Clap once.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.685
Simon says.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.479
Touch your nose.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.865
Simon says, put your hand down.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.453
Put your hand on your head.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.042
Simon didn't say to put
your hand on your head.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.504
Sadly, you are eliminated.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.156
No! No!

06:49.992 --> 06:50.743
Oh my god...

06:55.456 --> 06:57.124
Stay calm.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.627
Anyone
attempting to leave will be eliminated.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.386
What's up, guys?

07:09.387 --> 07:11.555
I thought I made the rules clear.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.558
You never said you were going to kill us.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.981
Yeah, Simon didn't say speak.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.108
Only twelve players remain.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.235
Good luck,

07:28.030 --> 07:29.114
Simon says.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.159
Stand on one foot.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.180
Carrie.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.431
What?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.809
He's leaning against the wall.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.353
He's cheating.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.422
Simon says.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.384
Hold your breath.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.785
Oh, Jesus.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.264
Hey!

09:25.773 --> 09:28.484
Simon says the game is over.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.151
Congratulations.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.613
The eight of you were able to complete
Game one.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.700
You've qualified for the chance
to win my accounts.

09:36.033 --> 09:39.245
And my one hundred and
fifteen million followers.

09:39.704 --> 09:43.291
Approach the camera
and state your name and occupation.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.044
Anyone who disobeys will be eliminated.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.730
Carrie Miller,

10:06.731 --> 10:08.190
I'm a singer songwriter.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.192
I'm AJ_620.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.820
I'm a video game streamer.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.238
Maxine.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.448
I'm a comedian.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.910
I'm Ruth Martin,
and I have the next big cooking show.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.162
Name's Stephen Randal.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.747
People call me "Squish"

10:23.748 --> 10:25.415
I'm a motivational speaker.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.835
Walter Brentwood, entrepreneur.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.294
Jess Hardbody

10:29.295 --> 10:30.545
I'm dedicated to helping people

10:30.546 --> 10:33.257
achieve their dream body through hard
work, determination and focus.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.093
Kids, call me Ms. Sunshine.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.929
I make online content for children.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.275
Please follow me to the barracks.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.158
Today's footage, sir.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.870
Ooh, Simon says, thank you.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.331
Go.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.710
Luna!

11:10.044 --> 11:12.505
Honey, I got it.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.633
Luna, honey?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.139
Are you tanning?

11:23.140 --> 11:24.349
It's freezing!

11:24.350 --> 11:26.393
My followers want me tan!

11:26.394 --> 11:27.436
Oh my god...

11:28.270 --> 11:31.399
Well, I have the footage from Simon says.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.235
I cannot wait to see it all cut together.

11:35.236 --> 11:39.615
Gosh, honey, I am so excited to retire
and run away with you.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.367
I can't wait to get fat.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.080
Oh, we're going to get so fucking fat
with no one around to judge us.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.081
You'll finally, let yourself go bald

11:48.082 --> 11:50.208
and you'll stop tanning
and the cold.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.669
We'll be hideous.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.587
Oh, you're so out of my league.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.340
Not for long.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.511
But like, how fat?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.240
Clothes.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.790
This is so surreal.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.501
I'm still in shock.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.963
You and everyone else.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.550
I gotta call, my sister. I gotta...

12:46.015 --> 12:48.475
Hey. You okay?

12:48.476 --> 12:49.559
I'm scared.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.352
Yeah, us too.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.565
I'm just a preschool
teacher, I'm not going to make it far.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.612
Hey, the
three of us, we'll stick together.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.613
Alright?

13:02.448 --> 13:03.490
Oh, please.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.241
Are you serious?

13:05.242 --> 13:06.993
This surprises you?

13:06.994 --> 13:09.078
This is the big time, honey.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.583
Famous people drink the blood of babies
to stay young all the time.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.378
You really thought winning a hundred
million followers would be easy?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.090
Good luck, sweetheart.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.553
Hey. Take a deep breath.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.137
Think about it, we're dead!

13:26.138 --> 13:27.514
Just breathe! Hey!

13:27.515 --> 13:28.265
In.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.184
Out.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.439
You're right.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.191
I've got this.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.195
I'm motivated, I'm driven, I'm fit.

13:41.862 --> 13:42.695
I can do this.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.488
We can do this.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.574
We're going to be all right. OK?

13:51.997 --> 13:55.125
What a bunch of stinkers am I right?

13:56.168 --> 13:57.253
Stinkers?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.379
Yeah.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.589
You and me.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.466
We're smart.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.468
We know stuff.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.304
Everybody else is just ruled
by their emotions.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.853
Yeah, I'm not looking to make friends.

14:14.436 --> 14:15.396
You sure?

14:16.272 --> 14:19.065
I can start charming these ladies.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.109
Get us an advantage.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.947
Yeah? Think so?

14:24.989 --> 14:28.659
Dude, I could charm the
panties off Mother Teresa.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.708
Yeah, I'm not looking to make friends.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.545
But I could use an ally.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.131
Maxine.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.424
Look.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.721
Here we go.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.650
Where are we?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.778
Lights on!

15:11.869 --> 15:12.828
Whoa!

15:14.246 --> 15:15.496
What's up, guys?

15:15.497 --> 15:18.082
Game number two is hopscotch.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.335
The rules are simple.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.420
First, you'll draw a number.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.007
That number will represent the order
you'll go.

15:25.382 --> 15:31.513
Each player must hop across to win, but
if the board turns red, you can't move.

15:32.014 --> 15:36.185
If you do move when the board is red,
you will be eliminated.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.355
The game ends after the first elimination.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.440
Good luck,

15:42.358 --> 15:43.901
First contestant!

15:45.694 --> 15:46.737
Okay...

16:13.097 --> 16:14.390
How are you feeling?

16:15.641 --> 16:16.308
Good.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.561
Like I said, I'm a preschool teacher,

16:20.354 --> 16:23.107
hopscotch is my specialty.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.609
What were you whistling?

16:26.860 --> 16:27.861
You'll see.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.031
Next contestant.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.290
OK. All right.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.250
Here we go.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.021
That. What is that?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.648
Shh!

17:16.285 --> 17:17.077
Almost there.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.329
Almost there. Almost there. Almost there.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.124
You think she'll make it?

17:22.833 --> 17:24.209
Quiet!

17:35.763 --> 17:36.763
Trade with me.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.098
What? Why? You have the best number.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.224
I feel good about this.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.478
I'm trying to do you a favor.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.395
OK. Sure.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.397
Thanks.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.110
Next contestant.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.021
Yes!

18:26.897 --> 18:29.650
Yes! Send the flowers,
she's done! She's done!

18:29.900 --> 18:32.236
She's done! Oh, yes!

18:35.072 --> 18:36.698
No, no, no, no, no!

18:38.033 --> 18:40.077
No! Stop!

18:40.285 --> 18:42.329
Please! Stop!

18:43.330 --> 18:45.374
No no no no!

18:45.499 --> 18:48.210
No! Stop! Please!

18:50.254 --> 18:51.964
Please, stop! Stop!

18:56.760 --> 18:59.138
Stop it, you're torturing her!

19:28.333 --> 19:29.458
That wasn't smart.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.753
I couldn't just let him torture her.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.464
You could have been killed.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.842
Hey.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.635
You were really brave back there.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.595
The hell do you want?

19:40.596 --> 19:41.138
Wait.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.640
Let him talk.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.976
Why'd you switch numbers with me?

19:49.563 --> 19:51.106
I told Squish

19:51.732 --> 19:53.566
I was on his side.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.860
I told him I'd get in with you
for his benefit.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.403
So are you on our side?

19:57.404 --> 19:59.990
I'm on whose
ever side helps me to take him down.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.157
How can we trust you?

20:01.158 --> 20:01.825
You can't.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.787
So what do you say?

20:06.955 --> 20:07.706
You in?

20:13.086 --> 20:15.630
You look like you could use a friend.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.339
Do I?

20:16.340 --> 20:17.341
Sure.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.969
You're a strong young man
and that helps me in the games

20:21.386 --> 20:25.474
and I'm a woman and I might be able
to help you in a different way.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.643
Really?

20:27.684 --> 20:28.518
Yeah.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.437
No.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.111
Hey, handsome.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.365
I have a question.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.076
Hey, I'm talking to you.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.371
Go away.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.997
I'm meditating.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.667
Leave me alone.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.628
You know, I've seen your videos before,

20:55.254 --> 20:58.882
all that motivational stuff
you did after you got out of prison.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.884
It's empowering.

21:01.885 --> 21:02.802
Where are you going?

21:02.803 --> 21:03.844
Anywhere else.

21:03.845 --> 21:04.595
Hold on.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.472
I want to tell you about my cooking show,

21:06.473 --> 21:08.976
Why? Only one of us
are going to make it out of here anyway.

21:09.017 --> 21:13.396
I have a cooking show and I have great
ideas for cookware and kitchen items.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.439
If you don't leave me the fuck alone

21:15.440 --> 21:17.275
I swear I will beat the shit out of you.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.528
You can't do that. I'm a woman.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.904
It's never stopped me before.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.908
You really need to learn
to control your emotions.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.167
Hey, are you OK?

21:35.168 --> 21:36.211
(Mumbling)

21:37.129 --> 21:38.797
I'm warning everybody right now

21:39.006 --> 21:42.384
do not fuck with me!

21:50.475 --> 21:51.726
Fucking jackass.

21:51.727 --> 21:52.727
I could have taken him.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.520
I just didn't see it coming.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.023
How? He warned you?

21:56.356 --> 21:57.316
Tilt your head back a bit.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.610
You seem to really know what you're doing.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.946
I was in med school before I was a gamer.

22:03.947 --> 22:06.533
Talk about a real downgrade, huh?

22:10.829 --> 22:12.163
I'm AJ, by the way,

22:12.164 --> 22:13.247
I don't think we formally met

22:13.248 --> 22:14.040
Maxine

22:14.041 --> 22:15.208
Carrie

22:16.251 --> 22:17.836
Sorry about your friend.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.879
This is ridiculous.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.841
We need to find a way out of here.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.219
Everyone, please prepare yourself for Game
three

22:27.471 --> 22:28.305
Already?

22:28.722 --> 22:29.889
Tonight.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.682
Let's look for a way out.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.517
Deal.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.899
Hey, baby,

22:39.024 --> 22:39.649
What's up?

22:40.692 --> 22:42.069
Any missing persons reports yet?

22:42.486 --> 22:45.780
No, I have been texting the families,
so no suspects anything.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.240
Oh, good. Good.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.243
You know, I really
think this is going to be my masterpiece,

22:51.036 --> 22:53.080
the perfect way to go out.

22:54.748 --> 22:59.044
How long, do you think,
until people realize it's real?

22:59.544 --> 23:01.045
Don't know, don't care.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.049
As long as we're on an island somewhere
when it all happens.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.218
Two more days...

23:06.802 --> 23:07.511
Two...

23:08.345 --> 23:09.721
No, three more days.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.015
Oh, duh.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.434
Three more days. Right.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.604
Good work.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.619
What's up, guys?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.831
You can take your blindfolds off.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.795
Welcome to the obstacle course.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.924
This game, however, is optional.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.511
You guys have tugged at my heartstrings,

23:50.262 --> 23:53.222
so I wanted to give you a way out.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.891
The rules are simple make it to

23:55.892 --> 23:59.438
the end in under sixty seconds
and you get to go home.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.314
No questions asked.

24:02.315 --> 24:04.567
Any volunteers?

24:04.568 --> 24:05.652
I'll do it.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.738
Bitch, I'm not going.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.615
Why not? You've had the shit
beaten out of you

24:11.616 --> 24:13.701
If you think a little bruise
is going to keep me

24:13.702 --> 24:16.955
from winning a hundred million followers,
you've got another thing coming.

24:17.289 --> 24:17.873
Whatever.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.386
This is too easy.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.889
What's the catch?

24:38.143 --> 24:41.146
Your time starts now.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.413
There's the catch.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.147
You gonna do it?

25:24.773 --> 25:26.690
What? Are you kidding? No way.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.652
We got a game to win.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.142
I did it!

26:01.643 --> 26:02.561
I did it!

26:13.655 --> 26:15.740
The contestant has
gone over the time limit.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.119
She's right.

26:24.624 --> 26:27.210
Would anyone else like to try?

26:31.131 --> 26:32.215
I'll go.

26:33.174 --> 26:34.341
What are you doing?

26:34.342 --> 26:35.217
I can do this.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.720
Don't you want to get out of here alive?

26:38.054 --> 26:39.598
I'm sorry.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.810
Carrie, this is suicide.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.157
And your time starts now.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.867
Wait, wait, wait.

27:09.544 --> 27:12.005
Help me understand

27:12.380 --> 27:15.425
This is a way out.

27:15.717 --> 27:19.304
It's risky, but it is a way out.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.932
And I want out.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.352
But I'm risking my whole life anyway,

27:26.353 --> 27:31.274
if I just go back to my stupid retail job
and singing in

27:31.733 --> 27:36.946
bars, whatever, I get the chance to drunks
who aren't even paying attention to me.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.743
It's a risk either way

27:43.953 --> 27:45.996
But something

27:45.997 --> 27:48.124
got us all here in the first place.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.671
Or I could stay here,

27:53.672 --> 27:56.299
and I can try to change things for myself

27:57.801 --> 28:00.302
and to have an audience of people

28:00.303 --> 28:03.890
who actually care to listen.

28:04.641 --> 28:08.603
Now that I've finally got my shot.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.731
I gotta fucking take it.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.957
Women, right?

28:30.792 --> 28:33.920
Wow! Only six contestants left.

28:34.713 --> 28:38.466
Now put your blindfolds on and
you'll be escorted back to the barracks.

28:39.050 --> 28:42.846
Game four is up next.

28:57.193 --> 28:58.069
Hey

29:01.156 --> 29:02.741
Ready to bring the contestants back in?

29:06.244 --> 29:09.080
You understand
any disloyalty will be punished by death.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.624
Jesus, again, with a loyalty thing?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.502
JaxPro saved my life.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.421
And he gave me millions.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.381
We all have our reasons.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.509
Hand it over.

29:22.510 --> 29:26.055
Listen, I'm here to do a job
and do it well, so please...

29:39.235 --> 29:41.571
Why are you packing already?

29:41.654 --> 29:43.990
I'm just excited.

29:52.081 --> 29:52.874
Who's that?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.043
Just my mom.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.212
Ew. Gross.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.341
I'm going to go call her.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.259
Mm hmm.

30:15.605 --> 30:16.648
You got it?

30:20.568 --> 30:21.652
How much do I use?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.905
A teaspoon. Any more,
and he'll taste it.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.156
Got it.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.075
When am I getting paid?

30:28.076 --> 30:30.160
He's cashing out after Game seven.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.871
That's what I'm going
to do it stop by then.

30:32.372 --> 30:32.956
Got it.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.043
Thank you.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.796
It's my pleasure, believe me.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.776
Let's find a way out here.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.652
What about him?

31:03.653 --> 31:05.696
He hasn't moved in two hours.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.448
Something's wrong.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.701
This is our chance.

31:09.993 --> 31:10.785
Go check.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.746
What's up, guys?

31:55.747 --> 31:58.750
Welcome to round four of the OctoGames.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.668
Musical chairs.

32:01.669 --> 32:05.172
I think these are all going to be kids
games.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.175
Kids games to have a winner
and a loser, Walt.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.261
The rules are simple.

32:11.220 --> 32:14.557
There are five chairs and six of you,

32:15.058 --> 32:18.561
when the music starts,
you'll walk in a circle around them.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.982
When the music stops,
you must sit down in one of the chairs.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.860
Whoever doesn't is out.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.447
The first person out will be eliminated.

32:29.822 --> 32:33.117
After that,
we will play to determine a winner.

32:33.743 --> 32:37.455
Speaking of winner,
this game does have a prize.

32:38.039 --> 32:43.378
This winner will have one million dollars
deposited into their bank account.

32:44.295 --> 32:47.340
Why would we want a million dollars
if you're just going to kill us?

32:48.424 --> 32:50.717
Don't you guys have like families

32:50.718 --> 32:53.054
that would want it or something?

32:54.013 --> 32:55.807
May the best player win.

33:33.136 --> 33:33.970
AJ!

33:39.684 --> 33:42.061
AJ, no! No!

33:51.362 --> 33:53.156
All rise.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.335
Now to get that million.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.963
Split it with me
if I get myself eliminated?

34:09.964 --> 34:11.465
How does fifty grand sound?

34:11.466 --> 34:13.176
Works for me.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.526
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.529
It's OK, it's OK.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.318
Fuck you.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.951
Fuck it. Whatever.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.809
Don't even try it.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.237
This is fun!

36:05.830 --> 36:08.833
AJ! You're OK.

36:11.377 --> 36:14.672
Barely, but yeah.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.135
Wait, what's going on?

36:19.802 --> 36:20.886
Hey, guys.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.556
So I wanted to make this game
a little more interesting.

36:24.056 --> 36:27.226
Eliminating the first person,
is a little boring,

36:27.560 --> 36:31.397
so I decided why not make winning
this prize more intense?

36:31.981 --> 36:35.818
Two of you remain
one of you will get the prize.

36:36.485 --> 36:38.029
The other will die.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.781
Good luck.

36:45.161 --> 36:48.163
Well, may the best man win.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.540
Bite me.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.044
We gotta take him down.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.182
Look, I'm not asking you to help me win,

37:49.016 --> 37:52.603
I'm asking you to help me stop him.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.945
I'm in.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.447
Me, too.

38:07.994 --> 38:08.536
Thank you.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.288
You won't regret it.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.295
I was wrong about you.

38:17.837 --> 38:18.713
Sorry.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.047
I know.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.094
There she is.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.597
Where am I?

39:10.598 --> 39:13.809
That doesn't matter,
you impressed me back there.

39:14.393 --> 39:16.937
I wanted to meet you.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.188
JaxPro?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.565
In the flesh.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.401
Oh my God.

39:23.402 --> 39:26.280
No offense, but you're fucking crazy.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.241
And I like that.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.453
So I have a little proposition for you.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.873
I want you to help me

39:36.040 --> 39:38.918
with the rest of the games.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.171
Are you going to kill me?

39:43.172 --> 39:45.424
No, I'm going to hire you.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.968
Two million dollars.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.596
And once we're done, I'll let you go.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.100
I'm in

39:54.642 --> 39:55.476
good.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.603
And you know what?

39:59.313 --> 40:02.108
The fun is just beginning.

40:11.325 --> 40:12.492
Fifty grand.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.786
Man of my word.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.538
It was beautiful,

40:15.913 --> 40:18.374
Carrie actually thought
I was doing her a favor.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.917
So how's that going, huh?

40:20.918 --> 40:21.876
Any new information?

40:21.877 --> 40:24.129
Not really. Just a bunch of ditzy kids,

40:24.130 --> 40:25.673
just like I suspected.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.301
So what's this I hear...

40:29.927 --> 40:31.470
about y'all trying to take me down?

40:33.514 --> 40:35.099
How'd you hear that?

40:35.474 --> 40:36.142
I didn't.

40:37.309 --> 40:38.393
Just a lucky guess.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.811
No, no. See what I was doing, I was...

40:39.812 --> 40:40.896
Listen, Walt.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.899
I will break your fat fucking neck

40:44.108 --> 40:45.443
if you betray my trust.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.194
You understand me?

40:48.195 --> 40:49.113
Yes, sir.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.158
Atta boy.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.834
I don't trust him.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.211
Don't have to.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.506
We just have to believe that taking down
Squish is in his best interest.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.925
Which it is.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.846
I think he's playing the field.

41:14.013 --> 41:16.014
That can only backfire for him.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.599
He can't be that dumb.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.184
Oh my God.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.060
This is driving me crazy.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.938
I feel so hopeless.

41:24.440 --> 41:28.277
I mean,
it's basically a hostage situation.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.614
I just wanted to boost my music career.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.325
This isn't your fault.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.119
You know that, right?

41:38.245 --> 41:40.414
I could have gotten out
through the obstacle course.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.416
Hey, that thing was a death trap

41:43.417 --> 41:44.668
and you know it.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.381
I guess so.

41:57.223 --> 42:00.226
I really wish we had met
on the outside of all this.

42:01.685 --> 42:05.064
We could have done, like, a
project together or something.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.447
Put on your blindfolds

42:14.448 --> 42:16.992
and prepare for Game five.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.704
Who is that?

42:29.630 --> 42:30.797
Second half,

42:30.798 --> 42:32.049
we still good?

42:47.940 --> 42:49.733
Everyone take off your blindfolds.

43:00.202 --> 43:02.829
We need to find a way out of here.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.747
We should go for a window.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.499
The doors are probably locked.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.334
Let's just keep an eye out.

43:08.335 --> 43:11.130
And if one of us escapes we'll send help.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.173
Man, that new guard is kind of short.

43:14.842 --> 43:15.842
Looks like the old guard

43:15.843 --> 43:16.969
got left in the dryer.

43:18.929 --> 43:21.056
What, you don't recognize her?

43:21.390 --> 43:22.766
No, should I?

43:27.980 --> 43:29.355
What's up, guys?

43:29.356 --> 43:31.274
Welcome to Game five.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.942
Hide and seek.

43:32.943 --> 43:34.902
Only five of you remain.

43:34.903 --> 43:36.989
The rules are obvious

43:37.531 --> 43:40.868
You will have sixty seconds to hide
anywhere in this house.

43:41.410 --> 43:44.872
After that,
The Eliminator will try to find you

43:45.623 --> 43:48.667
the first person he finds is out.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.295
Good luck.

43:57.134 --> 44:01.513
60, 59, 58,

44:02.389 --> 44:06.477
57, 56, 55

44:48.894 --> 44:49.894
Shit

44:49.895 --> 44:50.395
Maxine.

44:51.271 --> 44:52.730
Get over here with me.

44:52.731 --> 44:53.606
It's fine.

44:53.607 --> 44:55.776
I'll find somewhere else to hide.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.446
24, 23,

45:00.280 --> 45:03.659
22, 21, 20,

45:04.785 --> 45:10.624
19, 18, 17, 16, 15,

45:11.458 --> 45:13.627
14, 13,

45:19.133 --> 45:20.299
Can I squeeze
back there with you?

45:20.300 --> 45:21.635
I mean, you can try.

45:22.928 --> 45:23.846
Maxine.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.936
Ten. Nine.

45:32.020 --> 45:35.524
Eight. Seven. Six.

45:39.486 --> 45:40.362
Thank you.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.949
Five. Four.

45:44.658 --> 45:48.579
Three. Two. One.

45:50.330 --> 45:51.706
Ready or not,

45:51.707 --> 45:53.584
here he comes.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.234
No, no!

47:43.235 --> 47:44.778
Get the fuck out!

47:49.700 --> 47:50.826
Stop!

47:53.620 --> 47:55.247
What are you doing?

47:57.207 --> 47:58.500
Please.

48:01.962 --> 48:03.213
I'm sorry.

48:32.367 --> 48:33.035
What are you doing?

48:33.577 --> 48:34.211
What are you doing?

48:34.703 --> 48:35.704
What are you doing?

48:35.871 --> 48:36.788
I'm so sorry.

49:07.736 --> 49:08.986
Hey, hey, hey.

49:08.987 --> 49:10.112
Look at me.

49:10.113 --> 49:11.114
It was you or her.

49:11.490 --> 49:12.031
Okay?

49:12.032 --> 49:13.199
You or her.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.034
You did good.

49:21.249 --> 49:22.334
Please.

49:23.126 --> 49:24.461
Please.

49:36.348 --> 49:37.641
Carrie!

49:38.225 --> 49:39.643
Maxine!

49:47.693 --> 49:49.111
Maxine!

50:11.758 --> 50:16.847
I'm so sorry, Maxine.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.729
What happened,

50:24.730 --> 50:27.691
Squish, crammed into the closet
with me and Maxine

50:27.983 --> 50:30.318
and then he threw out when he heard
somebody coming in.

50:35.407 --> 50:36.323
It's nothing personal.

50:36.324 --> 50:38.243
Someone has to lose.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.579
We're down to four.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.167
Carrie, I'm so sorry, it happened so fast.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.544
Go away.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.101
Ruth

51:06.146 --> 51:06.979
You were still breathing

51:06.980 --> 51:08.648
when they drug you out.

51:11.026 --> 51:13.028
I'm going to make sure you lose.

51:26.666 --> 51:29.251
So, game seven's coming up.

51:29.252 --> 51:30.086
Mm-Hmm.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.337
What's the plan?

51:31.338 --> 51:34.965
Well, we're going to cash out that night
and then right after Game eight,

51:34.966 --> 51:38.095
we're going to upload the video and he's
going to fly us out to the island.

51:38.595 --> 51:39.930
Good, good.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.766
How are things with Ruth?

51:43.642 --> 51:46.019
As if on cue.

51:51.149 --> 51:53.401
Hi!

51:59.449 --> 52:01.367
Ruth, this is my girlfriend.

52:01.368 --> 52:03.787
Oh, Luna Laughlin.

52:04.454 --> 52:07.207
Oh my God,
you're just as gorgeous in person.

52:07.290 --> 52:10.168
You're so sweet.

52:11.169 --> 52:11.710
Come on.

52:11.711 --> 52:13.171
I'll give you the tour.

52:17.175 --> 52:20.846
Enjoy him while you can, honey.

52:26.434 --> 52:27.018
Hey.

52:28.270 --> 52:29.896
Good work, back there.

52:30.063 --> 52:30.814
Thanks.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.360
Final four.

52:37.612 --> 52:40.198
Happens when it's just you and me?

52:40.532 --> 52:43.451
Well, I guess the best man wins.

52:56.506 --> 52:57.506
I was

52:57.507 --> 53:00.427
almost out.

53:02.429 --> 53:05.140
If the guard didn't see you,
you would have escaped, right?

53:05.849 --> 53:07.058
Right.

53:07.517 --> 53:09.894
That means there's holes in their design.

53:09.895 --> 53:12.564
We just have to wait for the next one.

53:13.732 --> 53:16.318
What if I'm not alive in the next one?

53:31.708 --> 53:34.127
Oh my god, will you quit your whining?

53:35.587 --> 53:37.797
Who the hell do you think you are?

53:40.300 --> 53:43.511
I'm just a guy in a game of life or death
and treating it as such.

53:43.803 --> 53:46.431
You killed an innocent person.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.309
No, I didn't.

53:49.976 --> 53:51.061
He did.

53:57.150 --> 53:58.693
You're evil.

53:58.735 --> 53:59.402
You know?

53:59.861 --> 54:01.362
Yeah? Why?

54:01.363 --> 54:03.865
Because I'm fighting for my survival
just like you?

54:05.158 --> 54:07.993
Because you only think about yourself.

54:07.994 --> 54:10.956
So you tell me,
what do I get out of helping any of you?

54:13.875 --> 54:14.793
Right.

54:21.758 --> 54:22.926
This.

54:23.677 --> 54:25.010
Is my studio.

54:25.011 --> 54:28.515
Oh, wow,
so this is where everything happens.

54:31.017 --> 54:32.142
What's up, guys?

54:32.143 --> 54:33.520
JaxPro here.

54:36.648 --> 54:37.315
Locked.

54:37.774 --> 54:38.774
Now...

54:38.775 --> 54:42.404
there is one more thing
I'm going to need you to do for me.

54:43.488 --> 54:45.699
Anything for you.

54:57.919 --> 55:01.756
Today was your audition and you passed.

55:02.590 --> 55:04.384
Congratulations.

55:04.843 --> 55:08.972
This one was caught by another guard
carrying cyanide

55:09.306 --> 55:12.851
most likely to try and kill me.

55:17.022 --> 55:18.440
You know what to do?

55:53.433 --> 55:55.643
Y'know we could just take our chances
and run for it.

55:56.311 --> 55:57.687
They'd shoot us on sight.

55:59.314 --> 56:00.189
What if we rushed them?

56:00.190 --> 56:01.565
They can't take us all out at once.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.400
You rush them, I'll
fight every one of you.

56:03.401 --> 56:04.860
The hell is wrong with you?

56:04.861 --> 56:06.862
I'm about to win this thing
and everybody knows it.

56:06.863 --> 56:09.949
You almost lost the last game.

56:10.742 --> 56:12.202
Careful, Carrie.

56:12.952 --> 56:15.205
You remember what happened to Ruth?

56:16.581 --> 56:18.207
What's up, guys?

56:18.208 --> 56:20.418
Welcome to Game six,

56:20.919 --> 56:23.671
tether ball, a playground favorite.

56:23.922 --> 56:26.340
What's with all the kids games?

56:26.341 --> 56:28.468
Who do you think watches my videos?

56:30.011 --> 56:32.554
The rules are simple,

56:32.555 --> 56:34.848
hit the ball all the way around the pole

56:34.849 --> 56:40.271
and you win, we'll be playing three rounds
of one on one tether ball

56:40.980 --> 56:44.567
AJ versus Walt and Carrie versus Squish.

56:45.360 --> 56:48.654
The losers will
then play each other in the final round

56:48.655 --> 56:50.906
to determine who is eliminated.

56:50.907 --> 56:52.825
Still feeling so cocky?

56:52.826 --> 56:56.704
We will be playing Game
seven later this evening and tomorrow

56:57.038 --> 56:59.165
we'll be playing the final game.

57:00.125 --> 57:00.750
Good luck.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.263
Oh, my God.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.141
God... Okay...

57:27.527 --> 57:30.405
first up is Walt and A.J..

57:46.713 --> 57:49.256
Sorry we have to do this.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.258
I can see right through you.

57:51.259 --> 57:54.929
I don't know what it is you think you see,
but I promise you, I want what you want.

57:55.221 --> 57:57.598
I know you killed Maxine.

57:57.599 --> 57:58.391
What?

57:58.892 --> 57:59.559
Why would I?

58:00.518 --> 58:01.478
Ah! Jesus!

58:02.645 --> 58:04.939
AJ, you got this. C'mon c'mon c'mon!

58:05.482 --> 58:07.692
Go, A.J., Come on.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.528
Come on, Walt.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.533
Come on, you can do this.

58:16.534 --> 58:17.827
Come on, keep going.

58:20.830 --> 58:22.123
Yes!

58:24.501 --> 58:27.753
Oh, fuck me!

58:27.754 --> 58:29.130
And that's for Maxine.

58:36.596 --> 58:39.390
The winner is A.J.

58:41.893 --> 58:43.727
Take that, Boomer.

58:43.728 --> 58:46.648
Next up is Carrie and Squish.

58:52.987 --> 58:54.113
For the record...

58:55.198 --> 58:57.282
Walt killed Maxine.

58:57.283 --> 58:58.408
Only because I told him to.

58:58.409 --> 59:00.202
That's not true.

59:00.203 --> 59:03.373
I guess it's your word against mine.

59:32.026 --> 59:32.944
Good job

59:34.821 --> 59:35.905
The winner is Squish.

59:40.034 --> 59:41.619
What the hell was that?

59:41.744 --> 59:45.581
Think about it. I could either
lose to you, hurt my hands

59:45.582 --> 59:47.792
and then play Walt. Or...

59:48.876 --> 59:51.045
I could let you win.

59:51.129 --> 59:54.132
And play Walt with clean hands.

59:55.174 --> 59:57.843
You're not the only one who can play
smart.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.971
That's not fair.

1:00:01.889 --> 1:00:04.809
That's what I'm talking about,
that's playing smart.

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:08.021
Next up is Walt and Carrie.

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:13.067
Well,

1:00:13.985 --> 1:00:15.695
Nice knowing you, Walt.

1:00:18.364 --> 1:00:19.240
Goddammit...

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:31.711
Carrie, please, no...

1:00:32.211 --> 1:00:34.255
you know, to do this
to me, Carrie, please.

1:00:36.382 --> 1:00:37.717
Yes, come on.

1:00:42.138 --> 1:00:43.931
He's fucking done.

1:00:56.152 --> 1:00:58.529
Winner is Carrie.

1:01:03.117 --> 1:01:05.745
Please, please, no,

1:01:07.163 --> 1:01:09.082
I don't want to die.

1:01:09.624 --> 1:01:12.000
I see you're finally catching on.

1:01:12.001 --> 1:01:12.960
Good job.

1:01:15.963 --> 1:01:18.299
Give me one more game.

1:01:19.258 --> 1:01:20.385
I don't wanna die.

1:01:21.427 --> 1:01:22.970
Guys, do something!

1:01:23.513 --> 1:01:25.764
They're gonna kill me!

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:26.516
Carrie...

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:29.476
oh, Jesus Christ.

1:01:29.477 --> 1:01:30.853
Do something!

1:01:45.493 --> 1:01:46.285
No...

1:01:47.036 --> 1:01:47.995
You were supposed to

1:02:27.201 --> 1:02:29.787
I thought we had a deal. You were...

1:03:00.401 --> 1:03:02.069
What are you looking at?

1:03:08.159 --> 1:03:10.912
Whoa! That was a great game!

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:13.038
Only three of you remain.

1:03:13.039 --> 1:03:16.666
Carrie, Squish, and AJ

1:03:16.667 --> 1:03:19.212
Game seven will be played later tonight.

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:23.174
I'm so excited!

1:03:29.013 --> 1:03:31.182
What do we do now?

1:03:32.183 --> 1:03:33.851
All I know

1:03:34.936 --> 1:03:37.021
is that one of us is going
to make it out of here alive.

1:03:38.105 --> 1:03:40.399
It's going to be you or me.

1:03:41.859 --> 1:03:43.778
How do you know that?

1:03:46.364 --> 1:03:49.116
Cause we're going to
make sure Squish dies.

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:53.663
What if it ends up being you versus me?

1:03:56.624 --> 1:03:59.126
We're not going to think about that yet.

1:04:09.345 --> 1:04:11.889
Honey, where's my G-fuel?

1:04:12.348 --> 1:04:13.057
It's coming.

1:04:29.657 --> 1:04:30.449
Thank you.

1:04:37.123 --> 1:04:38.499
Have you tried this?

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:41.168
Oh, yeah, I hate it.

1:04:42.712 --> 1:04:43.880
But like this flavor?

1:04:44.714 --> 1:04:46.090
It's all gross to me.

1:04:47.675 --> 1:04:50.553
Every flavor? Come on.

1:04:52.054 --> 1:04:53.347
I've tried that one.

1:04:53.848 --> 1:04:56.349
No, you haven't this is a new flavor.

1:04:56.350 --> 1:04:56.892
Come on.

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:58.643
Would you just take a sip for me?

1:04:58.644 --> 1:05:00.771
Why do you want me
to try this shit so much?

1:05:01.022 --> 1:05:05.150
Because I like sharing things
with the people I love. Sue me.

1:05:05.151 --> 1:05:07.777
Please just take a sip.

1:05:07.778 --> 1:05:09.739
I don't want it.

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:23.210
Luna, try it.

1:05:23.711 --> 1:05:25.504
It's nasty.

1:05:28.299 --> 1:05:29.759
Try it or I'll hurt you.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:34.179
I just had Ruth

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:37.516
kill a guard
because they were caught carrying cyanide.

1:05:38.351 --> 1:05:41.187
Now I don't know if they were trying
to fuck with the games

1:05:41.771 --> 1:05:47.026
or if they were trying to kill me
or they were trying to give it to you.

1:05:47.902 --> 1:05:50.988
And if there's nothing in here,
we have nothing to worry about.

1:05:52.198 --> 1:05:53.866
Get back here!

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:14.804
You shot her.

1:06:17.223 --> 1:06:19.849
Yes. But when I stopped by to

1:06:19.850 --> 1:06:23.312
bring you the footage from the game,
I heard you arguing upstairs.

1:06:23.938 --> 1:06:28.108
And so when she came down the stairs, I
I just wanted to protect you, JaxPro, I...

1:06:28.109 --> 1:06:30.235
I didn't know
what she was going to do to you.

1:06:30.236 --> 1:06:32.154
Give me the gun.

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.678
Just to be sure.

1:06:56.762 --> 1:06:58.639
You did the right thing.

1:06:59.181 --> 1:07:01.017
I won't forget this.

1:07:04.562 --> 1:07:06.814
You might think what I've done is shocking

1:07:08.190 --> 1:07:10.233
to me, the OctoGames was the natural

1:07:10.234 --> 1:07:12.987
answer to the myriad of problems
life had given me.

1:07:13.446 --> 1:07:17.199
Life and the internet treated me
like a product to be bought and sold,

1:07:17.616 --> 1:07:20.286
like something to be watched
rather than understood.

1:07:21.037 --> 1:07:24.664
So I held the OctoGames, a real life
fight to the death

1:07:24.665 --> 1:07:29.545
where people are treated the way
I was treated my entire life as product.

1:07:31.839 --> 1:07:35.259
Hmm. That's a hell of a suicide note.

1:07:37.219 --> 1:07:38.804
What now?

1:07:39.597 --> 1:07:42.433
I pack my bags
and I leave the country after Game eight.

1:07:44.643 --> 1:07:45.978
Alone?

1:07:47.688 --> 1:07:48.898
I guess so.

1:07:49.857 --> 1:07:51.232
What about me?

1:07:51.233 --> 1:07:53.778
I'll pay you the two million
tomorrow morning.

1:07:54.445 --> 1:07:57.740
You know that's not what I meant.

1:08:00.493 --> 1:08:01.409
We couldn't

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:03.537
Why not? We're made for each other.

1:08:04.205 --> 1:08:05.456
Yeah, but

1:08:06.165 --> 1:08:07.583
you're, like, old and stuff.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.378
But we'll be on an island!
No one can judge us.

1:08:12.505 --> 1:08:14.090
I guess that's true

1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:17.635
Better with someone old than
no one at all.

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:25.226
That might just be insane enough to work

1:08:26.143 --> 1:08:28.270
you like insane, remember?

1:09:31.333 --> 1:09:32.667
What's up, guys?

1:09:32.668 --> 1:09:35.796
Welcome to Game seven, Hangman.

1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:38.423
A classroom favorite.

1:09:38.424 --> 1:09:40.676
The rules are simple.

1:09:41.051 --> 1:09:45.180
We have a mystery phrase
and each of you will take turns

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:48.726
guessing one letter for each letter
you get wrong

1:09:49.143 --> 1:09:52.855
you will receive a bigger and bigger
electric shock.

1:09:53.522 --> 1:09:56.984
If you guess the phrase,
you'll be released from your chair.

1:09:57.359 --> 1:09:59.945
The first person to stop breathing loses.

1:10:00.571 --> 1:10:02.280
This one's a fun one.

1:10:02.281 --> 1:10:05.409
You have two seconds per guess. Good luck.

1:10:10.539 --> 1:10:11.540
Squish.

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:13.209
You're up.

1:10:15.377 --> 1:10:16.545
Time's up.

1:10:20.883 --> 1:10:21.550
T

1:10:25.638 --> 1:10:26.305
L

1:10:31.810 --> 1:10:32.310
F

1:10:33.229 --> 1:10:33.938
Wrong.

1:10:38.192 --> 1:10:39.318
Focus on the vowels.

1:10:39.568 --> 1:10:40.236
A

1:10:42.738 --> 1:10:43.405
E

1:10:46.158 --> 1:10:46.825
O

1:10:50.329 --> 1:10:50.996
I

1:10:53.499 --> 1:10:54.166
N

1:11:00.965 --> 1:11:01.632
Time!

1:11:12.768 --> 1:11:13.769
B

1:11:14.603 --> 1:11:15.187
Wrong.

1:11:22.528 --> 1:11:23.279
S

1:11:25.531 --> 1:11:26.739
D

1:11:26.740 --> 1:11:28.325
Wrong again

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:41.546
He's bombing.

1:11:41.547 --> 1:11:43.257
It's not over yet.

1:11:45.050 --> 1:11:45.634
R

1:11:46.677 --> 1:11:47.344
Wrong.

1:11:51.807 --> 1:11:52.933
M

1:11:57.730 --> 1:11:58.397
Time.

1:11:59.106 --> 1:12:00.481
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:12:00.482 --> 1:12:01.567
I'll solve it.

1:12:04.945 --> 1:12:05.988
Shock him

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:08.449
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:12:10.451 --> 1:12:12.661
Maxine lost the OctoGames.

1:12:21.879 --> 1:12:23.088
Shit.

1:12:34.725 --> 1:12:36.602
Congratulations.

1:12:36.852 --> 1:12:38.687
You can stand over there.

1:12:45.694 --> 1:12:47.571
Don't try anything.

1:13:07.216 --> 1:13:08.759
What do we do?

1:13:13.555 --> 1:13:15.307
There's no way out.

1:13:16.809 --> 1:13:18.394
What are you saying?

1:13:25.442 --> 1:13:27.820
You want to compete?

1:13:30.781 --> 1:13:32.032
I got this.

1:13:35.536 --> 1:13:36.620
Begin

1:13:37.538 --> 1:13:38.622
A

1:13:45.295 --> 1:13:46.296
Time.

1:13:51.510 --> 1:13:52.177
E

1:13:52.803 --> 1:13:54.263
AJ, what are you doing?

1:13:57.724 --> 1:13:58.725
Time.

1:14:01.728 --> 1:14:03.021
AJ, stop!

1:14:04.273 --> 1:14:04.940
I

1:14:06.191 --> 1:14:07.276
Wrong.

1:14:15.075 --> 1:14:16.160
Time.

1:14:21.248 --> 1:14:24.001
AJ, please!

1:14:33.010 --> 1:14:34.344
U

1:14:37.347 --> 1:14:38.682
No...

1:14:40.893 --> 1:14:42.227
Time.

1:14:46.148 --> 1:14:48.525
No, no. No no no no.

1:15:09.546 --> 1:15:11.797
Very good game, everyone.

1:15:11.798 --> 1:15:14.467
Such a tender moment.

1:15:14.468 --> 1:15:16.720
I'll see you all tomorrow morning

1:15:17.054 --> 1:15:19.723
for the final game.

1:15:34.696 --> 1:15:36.657
What do you want?

1:15:36.865 --> 1:15:37.866
May the best man win.

1:15:41.036 --> 1:15:42.788
Best man?

1:15:47.793 --> 1:15:51.338
You have cheated your
way through this whole game.

1:15:52.089 --> 1:15:54.173
You have almost lost twice.

1:15:54.174 --> 1:15:56.843
You should be dead instead of. AJ

1:15:57.636 --> 1:16:00.138
instead of Maxine instead of all of them.

1:16:02.724 --> 1:16:04.850
You know,
it doesn't really matter what you think.

1:16:04.851 --> 1:16:05.519
Right?

1:16:12.693 --> 1:16:15.571
You think this world belongs to you?

1:16:17.281 --> 1:16:20.284
To nice people,
to people that play by the rules

1:16:20.951 --> 1:16:22.995
that bend over for the will of others?

1:16:24.204 --> 1:16:24.871
No.

1:16:26.623 --> 1:16:27.123
No.

1:16:27.833 --> 1:16:30.168
It belongs to us.

1:16:30.919 --> 1:16:33.212
Those that will do whatever it takes,
even if it means throwing

1:16:33.213 --> 1:16:36.091
everybody else under the bus,
that's who it belongs to.

1:16:36.258 --> 1:16:38.385
Wake up!

1:16:43.307 --> 1:16:45.601
You are going to die tomorrow.

1:16:47.894 --> 1:16:49.855
And I can't wait.

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:24.806
Uh, I'm looking for Mr. JaxPro?

1:17:25.766 --> 1:17:27.267
You're looking at him.

1:17:27.851 --> 1:17:28.351
Oh.

1:17:29.853 --> 1:17:31.188
Are you... Are you...

1:17:33.231 --> 1:17:35.941
Mr. JaxPro, sir. Hi.

1:17:35.942 --> 1:17:37.361
It's an honor to finally see your face

1:17:38.487 --> 1:17:40.280
Okay just come in.

1:17:45.327 --> 1:17:46.787
Wow.

1:17:49.331 --> 1:17:52.000
Do you know why I called you here?

1:17:55.170 --> 1:17:56.296
Yes, sir.

1:17:56.922 --> 1:17:59.549
Oh. Why?

1:18:02.469 --> 1:18:05.013
Because during the, um...

1:18:05.514 --> 1:18:06.389
You wanted to

1:18:06.390 --> 1:18:10.310
Because you ruined the goddamn illusion
during tetherball!

1:18:11.728 --> 1:18:12.938
I'm sorry.

1:18:14.856 --> 1:18:17.401
You let a boomer take off your mask.

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:22.114
Do you know how
un-scary your fucking face is?

1:18:22.322 --> 1:18:24.783
You're a fucking dweeb!

1:18:25.742 --> 1:18:26.868
What does that?

1:18:28.829 --> 1:18:29.787
The tattoo?

1:18:29.788 --> 1:18:30.455
Yes!

1:18:31.373 --> 1:18:32.833
Yeah, that's yours.

1:18:33.333 --> 1:18:35.167
I know it's my tattoo.

1:18:35.168 --> 1:18:36.920
Why do you have it?

1:18:37.629 --> 1:18:38.671
Because I look up to you.

1:18:38.672 --> 1:18:39.338
That...

1:18:39.339 --> 1:18:39.922
Eww!

1:18:39.923 --> 1:18:40.589
No!

1:18:40.590 --> 1:18:43.218
I'm a brand, you're nothing.

1:18:44.386 --> 1:18:45.095
I know.

1:18:46.012 --> 1:18:46.972
I'm sorry.

1:18:47.055 --> 1:18:49.641
Look, I know you hear this a lot,

1:18:49.933 --> 1:18:52.394
but I really am your biggest fan. OK?

1:18:52.728 --> 1:18:55.105
And I killed all those people,
just like you asked.

1:18:56.064 --> 1:18:57.566
Did you enjoy it?

1:19:00.610 --> 1:19:01.403
Well, yeah,

1:19:02.154 --> 1:19:03.405
very much.

1:19:04.656 --> 1:19:06.656
You know, it's always been a fantasy
of mine to kill someone.

1:19:08.994 --> 1:19:09.661
And...

1:19:10.579 --> 1:19:13.373
For a kid who never
had anywhere to belong,

1:19:14.332 --> 1:19:18.294
who didn't want to end up like everybody
fucking else in this shithole world,

1:19:18.295 --> 1:19:20.964
I'm sorry for cussing sir,
but you gave me someone to be.

1:19:22.549 --> 1:19:24.717
So you decided to be me.

1:19:24.718 --> 1:19:25.635
That's fucking pathetic.

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:27.636
Ruth!

1:19:27.637 --> 1:19:28.596
Wait, wait, no, no,

1:19:28.597 --> 1:19:30.849
Wait, please, please,
no, no, JaxPro, please!

1:19:30.932 --> 1:19:31.599
Wait!

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:32.768
No, no, no, no, no!

1:19:39.065 --> 1:19:40.691
What's up, guys?

1:19:40.692 --> 1:19:45.071
Welcome to Game eight,
one of you will win it all.

1:19:45.655 --> 1:19:47.949
The other will lose their life

1:19:48.992 --> 1:19:50.618
as soon as this is over.

1:19:50.619 --> 1:19:54.539
Everything will be uploaded to my channel
to be seen by hundreds

1:19:54.706 --> 1:19:56.665
of millions of people.

1:19:56.666 --> 1:19:58.918
They'll see what you've been through.

1:19:58.919 --> 1:20:03.131
The police will ask
all sorts of questions, but I'll be gone.

1:20:04.007 --> 1:20:06.510
The final game starts now.

1:20:07.135 --> 1:20:09.053
Capture the flag.

1:20:09.054 --> 1:20:11.097
The rules are simple.

1:20:11.932 --> 1:20:15.018
The first person
to hold the flag for three seconds wins.

1:20:15.519 --> 1:20:18.230
You cannot kill
or knock out the other contestant.

1:20:18.855 --> 1:20:21.775
If you do, you will be eliminated.

1:20:22.359 --> 1:20:25.195
And remember, play smart.

1:20:26.488 --> 1:20:27.697
Good luck.

1:20:30.158 --> 1:20:31.201
Five.

1:20:31.493 --> 1:20:32.536
Four.

1:20:33.161 --> 1:20:34.204
Three.

1:20:34.704 --> 1:20:35.747
Two,

1:20:36.623 --> 1:20:37.666
One.

1:20:41.503 --> 1:20:42.796
Here goes nothing.

1:20:57.269 --> 1:20:57.894
Hey!

1:21:00.105 --> 1:21:01.147
Let go, Carrie.

1:21:01.648 --> 1:21:03.691
Everything I did was for this moment.

1:21:03.692 --> 1:21:05.860
You will not take this from me.

1:21:05.861 --> 1:21:07.236
He's going to knock her out.

1:21:07.237 --> 1:21:07.903
Wait.

1:21:07.904 --> 1:21:10.407
I have a clear shot right now.

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:12.409
Not yet.

1:21:12.492 --> 1:21:15.244
You played well. Let it go.

1:21:15.245 --> 1:21:16.830
It's nothing personal.

1:23:34.384 --> 1:23:45.478
Congratulations! You're the
official winner of the OctoGames!

1:24:55.173 --> 1:24:56.174
Hello?

1:25:01.513 --> 1:25:04.641
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

1:25:05.892 --> 1:25:07.435
You're safe now,

1:25:07.936 --> 1:25:08.812
You won.

1:25:12.273 --> 1:25:13.942
Where am I?

1:25:14.984 --> 1:25:16.528
Your new home.

1:25:18.446 --> 1:25:21.032
The video has been uploaded.

1:25:22.075 --> 1:25:23.784
The police will likely start

1:25:23.785 --> 1:25:25.703
an investigation.

1:25:27.914 --> 1:25:28.873
Carrie.

1:25:31.126 --> 1:25:33.294
What you do next

1:25:34.212 --> 1:25:35.547
is up to you.

1:25:42.262 --> 1:25:43.138
Wait.

1:25:47.225 --> 1:25:49.394
Who are you?

1:26:05.285 --> 1:26:06.744
Be careful.

1:26:09.706 --> 1:26:11.457
I'm still rooting for you.

1:26:36.482 --> 1:26:39.777
911, what's your emergency?

1:26:48.161 --> 1:26:51.289
Hey, did you watch the song I just posted?

1:26:51.539 --> 1:26:54.918
Yeah, 200,000 views in one night,
I mean, that's amazing.

1:26:55.376 --> 1:26:56.127
How do you feel?

1:26:57.837 --> 1:27:00.256
You mean... To be the OctoGames girl?

1:27:00.924 --> 1:27:03.258
Yeah, but people are watching.

1:27:03.259 --> 1:27:05.720
That's what she wanted, isn't it?

1:27:07.388 --> 1:27:09.890
I guess I really don't know anymore.

1:27:09.891 --> 1:27:12.184
Hey, did you see the video I sent you?

1:27:12.185 --> 1:27:13.560
No, not yet.

1:27:13.561 --> 1:27:15.563
Watch it and call me back.

1:27:15.813 --> 1:27:16.856
Ok.

1:27:21.903 --> 1:27:22.986
What is up, you guys,

1:27:22.987 --> 1:27:26.824
it is your boy, Chip Chip Chippy McDaniel
here coming at you with another video.

1:27:27.075 --> 1:27:29.953
I'm here, girlfriend. Ruth!

1:27:30.245 --> 1:27:35.290
We're going to try candies from all
over the world, including Japan! Kawaii!

1:27:35.291 --> 1:27:38.044
But first,
we're filming from a secure compound.

1:27:38.211 --> 1:27:40.088
You know what's not
secure? Your wi-fi at a...
