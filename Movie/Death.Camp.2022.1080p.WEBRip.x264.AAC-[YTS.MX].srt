00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:25,292
- Tragedy struck the small
town of Los Almos, California

6
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,537
last night when 16 teenagers
were found brutally murdered

7
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:32,609
on the night of their
high school graduation.

00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,164
[ominous music]

9
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:38,926
- A local extremist by
the name of Norman Esner

10
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:42,550
who lives less than two
miles from the crime scene

11
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,658
has taken a young girl hostage
at his cabin this evening.

12
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,832
Police have set up a blockade,

13
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:52,733
but so far they've been
unable to free the hostage.

14
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:53,527
- Thanks, Marta.

15
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,116
I'm here at the Esner property

16
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,738
where authorities are
engaged in a tense stand off

17
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:59,705
with ex-patriot, Norman Esner.

18
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:02,087
Police have erected an
entire siege operation

19
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:05,539
around the cabin in hopes of
forcing Esner to negotiate

20
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,851
but so far talks
have not progressed.

21
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:12,028
Locals are encouraged to stay
at home and lock their doors.

22
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,755
A strict five o'clock
curfew for everyone

23
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:19,553
under the age of 18 remains
in place until further notice.

24
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:22,072
Here's more from the officers
in charge of this operation,

25
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,316
Officer Beckett
and Officer Nuno.

26
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:27,112
Officers, what's the latest
update in negotiations

27
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,596
with Esner?

28
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:31,841
- It's been three days, he
can't stay in there forever.

29
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:35,085
- He's probably stocked
food to last through winter.

30
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:36,328
- What's the plan.

31
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:37,502
[crowd screaming]
[gunshots firing]

32
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,193

- He left in the
shed, follow me!

35
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,271
Come on, come on!

36
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,000
- We have you
surrounded, Norman,

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,830
release the girl and we
can talk this through!

38
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,385
- I didn't hurt
anybody, I saved them!

39
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:02,423
I freed them?

40
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,357
- You didn't set them
free, you murdered them!

41
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:09,706
- Half a child's innocent
stops the day they come of age.

42
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:14,297
And when you people take that
child out of a natural habitat

43
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:17,231
that nurtured and cared for
it, you kill the other half!

44
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:24,618
You wonder why your children
are angry and confused,

45
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,587
'cause you forced them
to cross the bridge

46
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,451
from innocence to sin!

47
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,904
And for what, for what!

48
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,873
For this, for a lie!

49
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,120
For a nation built on lies!

50
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,952
- It doesn't happen to
be this way, Norman,

51
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,333
no one else has to get hurt!

52
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:55,787
- I saved them from that
and I saved them from you.

53
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,753
- Drop your weapon!

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,172
- I saved them from
that, I saved them!

55
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,695
You should thank me, sheriff!

56
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:10,353
You all should thank me!

57
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:11,872
I am their savior!

58
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:17,084
I will rise again.

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,749
- Unlatch the door,
unlatch the door.

73
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:14,822
- I fear neither death nor
life, dark master hear me now.

74
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:20,380
I pledge my soul to you until
the day I am called forth

75
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,036

picked a closer diner,

84
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,501
I'm starving.

85
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,985
- It has great reviews.

86
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,815
- Something tells me it
doesn't have rigatoni.

87
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:21,820
- It's June 13th,
2016 and here we are

88
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:23,235

not gonna be up for questions.

Couric, go interview them.

You know very well I'm going
to performing arts school

112

Here check this out, hmm?

114

She designed it
herself, kitty cat.

mean unlike some people.

120

Easy, she's blind.

141
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,281
- We thought it would be fun
to practice our witchcraft

142
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,869
with a seance there.

143
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,112
- And we're getting
in there how?

144
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,425
- I only found out about
the place a few weeks ago

145
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,083
after my mom put it up for sale.

146
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,637
I looked up the address and
discovered it's cool history.

147
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,674
- Your mom never
mentioned it before?

148
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,641
- No, I didn't even know
she owned the property

149
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,058
but that didn't stop me
from stealing the keys.

150
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,198
It's the perfect place
for one last party

151
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,166
before we all go
our separate ways.

be over before you know it.

this grilled chicken breast

158
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:36,049

made it my business.

- All right, geeze, man,
we was just joking around.

All right, pretty
boy, I'm sorry.

Why don't you go
back to your table.

171
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,116

leave, you big bully.

00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,594
- That psycho has a
disturbing collection.

358
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:46,597
- Use it for practicing
the dark arts.

359
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,875
- You guys practice
the dark arts.

360
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,119
- We only use our
magic for good.

361
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:53,535
He obviously used
his the wrong way.

362
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:59,230
- Kiss me, maiden.
- Get away!

363
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,439
[Greg laughing]

364
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,888
- [Greg] I think King
Tut forgot his mask.

365
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:03,856
- Put that back, Greg,
it could be valuable,

366
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,098
I'm talking to you idiots.

367
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,344
- I think he looks
younger in this one.

368
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,104
- Hey, I can't believe
you talked me into coming

369
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,935
to a place that once belonged
to a serial killer, Ashley.

370
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,592
Okay, I don't do
this sort of thing.

371
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:18,353
- Actually, he wasn't
a serial killer.

372
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:21,252
A serial killer's a person who
attacks and kills his victims

373
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,978
in a series of incidents.

374
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:25,636
Esner killed all his in one day.

375
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:27,500
- Well, he must have
been a really bad dude.

376
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,572
- Well, he didn't
start out that way.

377
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,714
He joined the military
right after high school

378
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:38,200
and quickly worked his way
up the ranks to sniper.

379
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,305
[dramatic music]

380
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:40,789
He made this town proud.

381
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,723
Even rescued a dozen of his
comrades who were held hostage

382
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:46,001
all by himself.

383
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,970
Brought back a necklace of
ears after that mission.

384
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,212
- Necklace of ears.

385
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:54,631
- He cut of an ear from
each enemy he killed.

386
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,012
I read it was at least 50 guys.

387
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:59,774
Him and his comrades were
tossing the necklace around

388
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:02,742
like some sort of
trophy all the way home.

389
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:03,605
Creepy huh?

390
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:08,576
- Grow up, you're so immature.

391
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:14,582
- But the war, all the
killing were too much for him.

392
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,378
He started to become
angry with the military

393
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:19,518
and his country.

394
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,176
He was discharged
and returned home.

395
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:26,663
After attempting to live
in town among civilians,

396
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:30,874
his odd behavior became
more and more noticeable.

397
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:33,497
Like preaching
anti-military propaganda,

398
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:36,535
said the military
stole his soul.

399
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,434
When it became apparent
that Esner wasn't going

400
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:43,162
to settle back into town,
he moved to this cabin

401
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:46,683
deep in the woods and
isolated himself here.

402
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:51,826
Then several veterans
officers around the US

403
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:55,450
reported receiving
envelopes with white powder

404
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,107
and anti-government rants.

405
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,732
They suspected it was him
but the lead investigator

406
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:03,044
had a soft spot for Esner.

407
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:07,566
His own son was one
of the men he rescued.

408
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:11,155
When one of the veteran's
offices reported

409
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:13,848
receiving a human
ear in the mail,

410
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:17,023
the investigator
knew it was Esner

411
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:22,028
but he made the case
and the ear disappear.

412
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:26,101
- And you found all
this out online, hmm?

413
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:26,895
- [Meghan] Yes.

414
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:29,622
- What do you say we
change the subject

415
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,694
and pick out our rooms, spruce
this place up a little bit?

416
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:33,902
- That sounds good to me.
- Maybe they can find

417
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,595
a few brooms and
sweep these floors.

418
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,044
- Yep, yes.

419
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:41,220
- Oh, Rita, Ashley and
James look around in here,

420
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,567
I saw some tools out back,
I'm gonna show Ashley

421
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,430
where they're at.

422
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:48,330
- Rick, help me unload the car?

423
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,436
- Oh Anna, honey can I
borrow your hairspray?

424
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:52,611
I think I left
mine in James' car.

425
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:55,441
- Of course, sweetie,
it's in my bag.

426
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:56,580
- Why don't you go buy a
tampon while you're at it.

427
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,582
- Very funny James.

428
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:00,895
- I would dear, but my
period ended last week.

429
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:02,931
- Come on.

430
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,696
- You could ease
up on him you know?

431
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:09,558
- I just feel like
every time I turn around

432
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:10,421
he's next to you.

433
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,770
You can't blame me for
wanting to have my girlfriend

434
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,047
all to myself, can you?

435
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,642
Next he's gonna be asking
to borrow your underwear.

436
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,438
- Actually, I told him he
could borrow some of Austin's.

437
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,648
You don't think
he'll mind do you?

438
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,650
He left all his
stuff in your car.

439
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,617
- Okay, okay, too much info.

440
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:36,689
All right, help me
clean up this dump.

441
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,762
- Yeah, clean up your face,
I got lipstick all over you.

442
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:43,523
[door squeaking]

443
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,665
- Oh my god.
- Whoa!

444
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,288
[teens laughing]

445
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,841
- Right, move this.

446
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,263
[teens laughing]

447
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,644
- Perfect.
- Hey.

448
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,239
[coughing]

449
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:12,035
[teens laughing]

450
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:12,863
- Perfect.

451
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,764
That's pretty comfy.

452
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:19,628
[Ashley laughing]

453
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,188
We can't do it right now.

454
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,638
- Sure we can, you promised.

455
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:44,861
- You still have that?

456
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:48,105
- The offer still
stands if you'll accept.

457
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:58,460
- Of course I'll
marry you eventually.

458
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:06,365
- You bitch.

459
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:09,748
- You know I need to
reach the world, you know,

460
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,474
make some new friends.

461
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,787
And luckily I've
already met Rita.

462
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,755
- Yeah, how does
Meghan feel about hat?

463
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,274
She can be awfully clingy.

464
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:22,761
- Meghan will be fine.

465
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,523
She knows I'm leaving,
I know Meghan.

466
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:29,353
- What the fuck, Ashley?

467
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:32,011
- She's always been such
a really good friend and

468
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:37,016
[Meghan seething]
[indistinct].

469
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,655
[Meghan screaming]
[dramatic music]

470
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:16,953
- Look what I found, huh?

471
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:17,988
- I thought all that
was lost in James' car,

472
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:19,610
thank Jesus.

473
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,820
- I must have put it
in Ashley's by mistake.

474
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,304
- I'll drink to that.

475
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,928
- You'll drink to anything.
- So, what's your point?

476
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:29,275
- Uh, Meghan, you're bleeding.

477
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:31,174
- What happened?

478
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:34,660
- I cut myself on a glass
vase, it's no big deal.

479
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,076
- You might wanna put
some medicine on there.

480
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:39,423
- I said I'm fine,
really I'm good.

481
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:45,326
- This weekend isn't just
a fun filled time for us,

482
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,879
it's also a test.

483
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:49,330
- Of our skills.

484
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,919
As most of you know we've
been studying witchcraft

485
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,403
the past few years.

486
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:57,062
- Today we offer you the
opportunity to join our coven,

487
00:30:57,062 --> 00:31:01,100
to watch, learn and
do as instructed.

488
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,585
Do you accept this opportunity?

489
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,520
- Sure, whatever.

490
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,660
What makes you think
this stuff is real?

491
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,524
- I can name dozens
of instances.

492
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:14,182
- When Ashley was failing
math, she did a spell

493
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:16,736
and she pulled her
grade from an F to a C

494
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,083
in just three weeks.

495
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,601
- Hmm-mm.

496
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,706
- You'd be amazed at what a
few weeks of hardcore studying

497
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,881
can do.
[people laughing]

498
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,503
- I cast a spell on my last
boyfriend that cheated on me,

499
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:28,714
he broke into hives
in a delicate area.

500
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:29,957
[Greg laughing]

501
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,544
I put a hex on that
bully, Sarah Winters

502
00:31:31,544 --> 00:31:33,684
who was harassing me at school

503
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,446
and the next day she
mysteriously dropped out.

504
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:39,898
- She dropped out
because she was pregnant.

505
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,245
- I cast a spell for Austin
to become the quarterback

506
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,454
of the football
team, which he did.

507
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:48,113
- Well, thank you baby.

508
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:51,392
- Oh, those all could
be coincidences.

509
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,703
- We also talk to the dead.

510
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,844
I talk to my mom all
the time through Meghan.

511
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,405
- So how do we do this?

512
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:05,440
- Oh, no not in here.

513
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:08,685
We're going down
to the basement.

514
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:10,929
- Oh the basement.
- Oh.

515
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,171
[teens laughing]

516
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:13,621
[ominous music]

517
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:15,105
- I wish it wasn't dark.
- It has to be dark

518
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:18,522
in here if you wanna join,
witches don't fear the dark.

519
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,663
Repeat after me.

520
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:23,320
I bind myself to this coven.

521
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:26,599
[disembodied entity laughing]

522
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,291
This isn't a joke,
say your liege.

523
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:32,847
- [All] I bind
myself to this coven.

524
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:37,196
- [Meghan] Do you
promise to protect

525
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,853
the members of this coven?

526
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,373
- Hey you got anymore of
that liquor back there?

527
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,719
- No, that was it.

528
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:46,550
- And it's keep
it's secrets close.

529
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,689
- What's this?
- What you got there

530
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:48,518
baby girl?

531
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,349
- [Meghan] Give me your hands,
I have to put a small cut

532
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:53,937
into each of you.

533
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,180
- You wanna play doctor?
- You know I wanna

534
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,974
play doctor.

535
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:00,288
Hey now, come on,
come on, cut it out.

536
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:03,947
Hey, come on, stop
it, man, I can't see!

537
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,155
[eerie music]

538
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:06,260
- [Meghan] Now we'll all
put our hands together

539
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,882
and become one.

540
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:11,541
- Hey I can't see, I
can't see, god damn it!

541
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:14,751
God damn it Mandy!

542
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,753
- [Meghan] Are there
any spirits here that

543
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:18,306
want to talk to us [indistinct]?

544
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:20,929
[Dan coughing]

545
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,657
- Come on, I can't
see a god damn thing.

546
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,143
[eerie music]

547
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,732
[ominous music]

548
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:37,981
- [Meghan] Of
magic [indistinct].

549
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:41,950
- Oh shit.
- I will rise again.

550
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,852
[car crashing]

551
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,282
- That wasn't there before.

552
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,009
- It was here when I came up.

553
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,424
- It's like super old school.

554
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:12,257
- You mean it still works?
- Only one way to find out.

555
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:21,887
[ominous music]

556
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,079
[victims screaming]

557
00:34:58,406 --> 00:34:59,511
[Rita gasps]

558
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,168
[James gasping]

559
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:04,688
[blade stabbing]

560
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,346
[tape ejecting]

561
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:13,870
- It could have been
filmed anywhere.

562
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:17,701
- Really, isn't that
the shed out back?

563
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,738
- I didn't see a shed out back.

564
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:20,566
- It's out there.

565
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,122
I saw it when Meghan
and I went for a walk.

566
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,126
So he filmed himself
during the slaughter,

567
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,162
do you think the
police know about this?

568
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,820
- I didn't find anything
online about a video tape.

569
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,408
- Did you see the way.

570
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:37,100
[Rita vomiting]

571
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:48,146
- Should we take the
tape to the police,

572
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,664
just brush it off as a hoax?

573
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,288
- That was no hoax.

574
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,186
- You heard how adamant
that cop was about us

575
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,912
not coming here.

576
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:56,982
He probably has
nothing better to do

577
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:58,535
than to fuck with tourists.

578
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:00,537
- Unless someone at
the diner overheard us.

579
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:05,059
- Real or not, now
whoever left this tape

580
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:07,165
is probably sitting
somewhere right now

581
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,235
having a good laugh.

582
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:12,756
- Rita was the only one in the
room when the tape appeared.

583
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:16,450
Ashley how well do
you really know her?

584
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,072
- Yeah, you really think that I.

585
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:19,729
- Meghan that's ridiculous.

586
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,558
- I was only
pointing out a fact.

587
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,388
I didn't mean to accuse anyone.

588
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:26,460
- You wanna know what
I think, I think Esner

589
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,186
left that tape for us.

590
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,532
Okay, you heard what he
said when we were down

591
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:31,050
in that basement.

592
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,951
I say we pack up our shit
and go before it's too late.

593
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,919
- Now, Esner went in the shed.

594
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,163
We should just check it out.

595
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:44,029
- Austin, are you crazy?

596
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:46,065
Check the shed, you know
what, give me your keys,

597
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:47,550
give me your keys, I'm leaving.

598
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,346
And anyone else who wants
to come too is welcome.

599
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:53,314
- Look, whoever left the
tape wanted to hurt us,

600
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:55,765
they would have done it
when they had the chance.

601
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:01,771
Here, take this if it'll
make you feel any better.

602
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:09,572
Come on.

603
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:16,855
- [James] Come on.

604
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:19,651
- [Anna] Okay.

605
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,049
[door creaks]

606
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,523
[Greg coughing]

607
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:06,318
- Probably tastes like
shit after 20 years.

608
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,700
- Yeah, you'd know Greg.
- Oh good one.

609
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:28,616
- Oh my god, is that
what I think it is?

610
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:32,240
- Well, I guess the story
about the necklace of ears

611
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,483
was true.

612
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:35,036
- Let's hope we don't
find the rest of them.

613
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,906
These letters are dated
over 20 years ago.

614
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:59,060
- I got you a present.

615
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,286
Face of angel, pure innocence.

616
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,916
You know I wasn't supposed
to keep you around this long,

617
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,055
don't you?

618
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,133
You're such a good girl for not
fighting me like the others.

619
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,929
[eerie music]

620
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,863
Can you offer me forgiveness
for not saving you?

621
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,496
I need you to forgive me.

622
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,232
[ominous music]

623
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,006
I need you to forgive me.

624
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,423
- Everybody got what they need?

625
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:27,839
Let's take a look at
them in the cabin.

626
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,428
Let's go.

627
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,166
- I need you to forgive me.

628
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:48,618
[victims screaming]

629
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:49,585
[car crashing]

630
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,103
[passengers screaming]

631
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,140
- Fuck fuck motherfucker!

632
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:56,005
God damn it!

633
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:58,973
[passengers crying]

634
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,598
- Are you okay?
- God no.

635
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,052
Come on, come on.
- Man!

636
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:12,780
- Ow my hair.
- How many times

637
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,713
do I gotta tell you to not mess

638
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:17,026
with me when I'm driving, huh?

639
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:23,377
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

640
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:24,620
- Go get!
[Mandy cries]

641
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,553
- Hey, maybe we can fix it.

642
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:29,521
- Maybe we can fix it, now
you sound as dumb as she does.

643
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,109
Man look at this
thing it's totaled.

644
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,628
- Hey.
- I'm on probation

645
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:35,493
and if anybody finds out about
this, I'm going to jail, so.

646
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,840
- Hey, look nobody saw us,
let's just ditch it right here

647
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,082
and go.
- Where,

648
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,912
ditch it and then go where, man?

649
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,189
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

650
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:43,880
- Look man, I don't know.
- Idiots.

651
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,848
- We gotta walk somewhere.

652
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:50,818
- Hey, hey, what about here?

653
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:00,172
- Huh, maybe you do got
some brain cells left

654
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:01,104
in that dumb head of yours.

655
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:04,349
Let's go, come on, come on!

656
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:10,458
- Dude, where the hell are we?
- Hey girls, we ain't

657
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:13,116
got all day, let's go!

658
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:34,137
- It's just letters.

659
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:37,900
[ominous music]

660
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:40,212
- Oh, ooh.

661
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:42,111
What is that?

662
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:46,978
- Uh.

663
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:49,532
- A dead lizard.
- Sick.

664
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:56,884
[ominous music]

665
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:08,689
- It's written in all caps.

666
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:16,870
"Dear reporter, I'm writing
this letter to condemn

667
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,320
our government and
military for the actions

668
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,426
they have taken
against humanity.

669
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:24,912
It took death and destruction
to bring me to the realization

670
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:28,536
that I too was once a
lamb plucked from my home

671
00:43:28,536 --> 00:43:31,229
and sent to unfamiliar pastures.

672
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:33,334
Taken from the safe
haven of my youth

673
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:36,614
to only be altered forever.

674
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,410
But like the lamb the wool
was pulled deep over my eyes.

675
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:46,313
These children are
being brainwashed

676
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:48,867
and manipulated under
false pretenses by not only

677
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:51,698
the military but also
these institutions

678
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:53,872
and modern day colleges.

679
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:56,737
They are uses these
children as puppets,

680
00:43:56,737 --> 00:44:00,085
removing the soul and
leaving only an empty shell

681
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:04,193
which like the marionette they
can manipulate with strings

682
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:05,194
to do their bidding.

683
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,716
We must spread the word
worldwide and put an end to them

684
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:11,269
before it is too late.

685
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,790
I feel like you are the
only one to tell my story.

686
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:18,656
I wait your reply,
Norman Ester."

687
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,669
"Dear reporter, I have been
patiently waiting your reply.

688
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,534
My story must be told and
I am running out of time.

689
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:39,159
I can't begin to tell
you how ashamed I am

690
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:41,506
every time someone
calls me a war hero.

691
00:44:42,956 --> 00:44:45,441
It absolutely destroys me
to think what this country

692
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:47,236
did to me and the other souls.

693
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:51,723
I feel a sickness in the
deepest pit of my soul

694
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:56,038
knowing I cannot save them
all from their ill fate.

695
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,386
A blackness is growing
within me and I know

696
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:01,457
if I do not act soon
it will spread until

697
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:03,666
it consumes everything.

698
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:07,049
Please let me know if you
have received this letter,

699
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:08,326
Norman Ester."

700
00:45:14,988 --> 00:45:16,783
- This one was sent
to the governor,

701
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:19,233
it was returned unopened.

702
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,379
- This was also sent
to the governor.

703
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,285
This one to the leader
of the CIA, FBI,

704
00:45:38,356 --> 00:45:40,772
another to the president
of the United States,

705
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:41,773
all unopened.

706
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,537
"Don't let them be next."

707
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:51,127
There's something
written on the back.

708
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:54,268
"Stop recruiters from going
to your schools, homes

709
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:56,857
and churches and
selling them on lies.

710
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:00,550
Save your children."

711
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,243
- That's beyond fucked up.

712
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,558
- These articles Norman match up

713
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,940
to the kinds of the letters.

714
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:19,777
- This one is dated June 14,
1995, the day of the massacre.

715
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:24,782
"I'm ready for doomsday.

716
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:28,026
Most people will not
understand my actions

717
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:30,926
but perhaps there will be those
enlightened ones who will.

718
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:35,689
I know my time here is
short and I will be forced

719
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:39,037
to take myself out of
this world in the process

720
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:43,076
but thanks to the ritual
I am able to return."

721
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:47,874
- Last one.

722
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:50,704
Do you wanna do the honors?

723
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:04,166
- "It has been two days since
I brought the girl here.

724
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:08,860
I admit that I find
something about her soothing

725
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,450
and I know now that there are
bigger powers at play here.

726
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:15,108
She was spared for a reason.

727
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,666
Linda Hamilton,
such a pretty name."

728
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,257
- Isn't that your mom's
name, Linda Hamilton?

729
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:29,191
Melinda Hamilton.
- No, no.

730
00:47:30,675 --> 00:47:34,437
- And you said your mother
only told that your father

731
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:36,129
died in the military.

732
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:38,856
- Yeah, my mom just doesn't
like to talk about it.

733
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,029
- There must be a connection.

734
00:47:40,029 --> 00:47:42,100
- And your mom
owning this cabin,

735
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,413
is that just a coincidence too?

736
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:46,553
There must be some kind
of unexplainable force

737
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:48,003
pulling you back to this cabin.

738
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:50,419
- I told you already I
found the keys by accident.

739
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:54,216
- There are no accidents
in the spirit world.

740
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:57,391
- Why are you guys
doing this to me?

741
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,394
You're supposed to my friends.

742
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:06,711
- So, Meghan's psycho's baby?

743
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:07,539
- Stop it!

744
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:11,716
That can't be true,
it's not true.

745
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,172
- Oh my god.
- You okay?

746
00:48:19,172 --> 00:48:20,380
- Yeah.

747
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,484
- Why do you always
have to be such a dick?

748
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,284
[item rattles]

749
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,150
- Hey!

750
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:41,988
Jesus, man.

751
00:48:43,782 --> 00:48:44,714
[Dan chuckles]

752
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:45,543
Good, you guys are all here.

753
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:47,441
- You again.

754
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:48,926
- Surprise.

755
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,548
- Come back to return my car?

756
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:53,344
- Oh yeah, about that Chuck,
I got in a little accident

757
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:55,277
on the way over here, sorry.

758
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,176
- What, what do you mean
you got into an accident?

759
00:48:58,176 --> 00:49:00,316
- Hey, man it wasn't
our fault you know?

760
00:49:00,316 --> 00:49:02,042
Smoke started pouring from
the hood, something ran

761
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,113
in front of us, a
deer or some shit.

762
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:06,046
- You reek of alcohol.

763
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,946
- Oh, man look,
the girls are hurt,

764
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,361
they need to go to the hospital.

765
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,570
- Go ahead, help yourself.

766
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,952
- She can't help it man,
she's the child of alcoholic,

767
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,918
right baby?

768
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:17,540
Give me that thing.

769
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,128
Hey you gonna bring us
to the hospital or not,

770
00:49:19,128 --> 00:49:20,647
give me the beer.

771
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:21,924
- Yeah, yeah, no, we'll
bring you to the hospital

772
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:22,960
right after we take
you to the sheriff.

773
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,755
[Dan grunting]

774
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:29,173
- What, come on, get off me!
- I'm putting you

775
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:31,106
under citizen's arrest.

776
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,417
Now you guys better
get out of here unless

777
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:34,799
you wanna be accessories
to this car-stealing,

778
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:36,697
woman-abusing piece of shit!

779
00:49:36,697 --> 00:49:39,114
- Stop it, no he's not!

780
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:40,391
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, he is.

781
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:42,600
- Mandy, Mandy, let them
take him, we need to go.

782
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,912
The cops are gonna show up
and I'm not gonna be here.

783
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:46,604
- What, Jeff, shut
the fuck up man!

784
00:49:46,604 --> 00:49:47,846
- This is what I've
been trying to tell you,

785
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:49,676
he's nothing but
an abusive loser.

786
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:51,574
You can do so much better.

787
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:52,990
- Let's go.

788
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:58,857
- Girl, you better not leave me!

789
00:49:59,893 --> 00:50:02,309
Mandy get back here!
- Shut up!

790
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:04,794
- [Dan] I'm gonna kick
your ass when we get home!

791
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:09,937
[Dan mumbling]

792

[Dan hollering]

793
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:17,945
- Get comfortable!

794
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,569
Piece of shit.
- Asshole.

795
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:21,570
- Woman abuser.

796
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:25,160
[Dan hollering]

797
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:40,347
[Dan breathing heavy]

798
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,524
- All right.

799
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:54,120
- Oh my gosh, please be careful.

800
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,576
[Austin grunting]

801
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:08,237
- No service.
- Me either.

802
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:12,414
- Well, Meghan won't
open the bathroom door.

803
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,764
- She probably just
needs some time alone.

804
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:19,490
That was a lot to take in.

805
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,838
- Some alone time doesn't sound
like a bad idea right now.

806
00:51:24,253 --> 00:51:25,530
Come.

807
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,980
- [Rick] Wait, where
are you guys going?

808
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,156
- Alone time as in
me and my girlfriend,

809
00:51:30,156 --> 00:51:32,641
not me, my girlfriend and you.

810
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:36,576
- Okay, you don't
have to be rude.

811
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:45,274
[ominous music]

812
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:02,188
- Don't be frightened
innocent one,

813
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:10,127
you're safe here with me.

814
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:12,301
This is our destiny.

815
00:52:21,897 --> 00:52:23,795
Lie back now young one.

816
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:30,077
Dark master's told
me what I must do.

817
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,982
[dramatic music]

818
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,892
- Thank god we're away from him.

819
00:52:52,755 --> 00:52:54,447
- Who?
- Rick,

820
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:56,759
he's so fucking annoying.

821
00:52:58,036 --> 00:53:01,247
- He's not that bad.
- Yes, he is.

822
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:05,320
You know, sometimes I
wonder, do you really think

823
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,217
he's gay?
- What?

824
00:53:08,495 --> 00:53:11,049
- He can't seem to
keep his hands off you.

825
00:53:11,049 --> 00:53:14,087
- Oh come on, he's
as gay as they come.

826
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:17,780
- I think he has
the hots for you.

827
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,819
- Do you think I could turn him?

828
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:25,305
- Maybe, you're awfully sexy.

829
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:28,757
- Why don't you show
me how sexy I am.

830
00:53:30,517 --> 00:53:32,105
- Here?

831
00:53:33,486 --> 00:53:35,212
- There's no one
around for miles.

832
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,248
- Good point.

833
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:47,224
- I know that look.

834
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:52,229
- Well, guess we don't
have any fuzzy handcuffs,

835
00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:55,093
guess we'll have to improvise,

836
00:53:57,544 --> 00:53:59,926
take what God's
green earth gave us.

837
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:03,205
- You're so kinky.

838
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,175
- Well, you know.

[Anna giggling]

840
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:13,733
Can't let a bad girl
like you get away.

[ominous music]

842
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:34,374
- I love it when you do that.

843
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,036
Why'd you stop?

00:54:44,729 --> 00:54:47,284
[Anna hollers]

845
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:50,252

847
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,773
I belong to you.

No, no, no, no, baby!

Baby come on, come on,
come on, come on, no.

No, no, no.

No!

No!

No!

[James gasping]

864
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:07,389
- James and Anna
should be back by now.

865
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:11,635
- I can't take this anymore,
I'm gonna go look for them.

866
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:17,226
Come on.

867
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,685
- Who's gonna guard the cabin?

868
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:33,553
Fuck this man, shit.

869
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:38,385
- I don't think they
would have come this far,

870
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:40,457
James is just too
much of a chicken.

871
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,632
- He was angry, I
mean, he might have

872
00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:44,461
walked back to the highway.

873
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:47,602
- Holy shit, what is that?

874
00:57:50,674 --> 00:57:53,746
What, is that blood?
- What the heck?

875
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,033
- Look at this picture
of Norman, can I have it?

876
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,275
- No, we have to stay invisible,

877
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,414
keep things exactly
the way they left them

878
00:58:07,414 --> 00:58:09,071
and we can't let
anyone know we're here.

879
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:10,556
- Oh okay.

880
00:58:10,556 --> 00:58:11,936

[girls screaming]

882
00:58:25,018 --> 00:58:26,468
- Quiet, remember what Dad said,

883
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:27,780
look for the light
and follow it.

884
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:39,516
- Oh, I miss you old friend.

885
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:44,624
Don't worry man, I'm
here to finish your work.

886
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,804
Yeah, yeah, I'll get it done.

887
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,878
[ominous music]

888
00:59:09,407 --> 00:59:14,067
- Excuse me, yoo-hoo, over here.

889
00:59:14,067 --> 00:59:16,518
Is the spooky cabin close by?

890
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:19,417
- Spooky cabin, who told
you about a spooky cabin?

891
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,282
- It's one of the stops
on our hiking trail.

892
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:24,146
- What, this is
private property,

893
00:59:24,146 --> 00:59:27,287
now you two get out of here.

894
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:28,426
- You don't have to be
rude, we were just trying

895
00:59:28,426 --> 00:59:30,428
to ask a question.

896
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:33,431
- You get out of here before
I make you sorry you're here.

897
00:59:33,431 --> 00:59:34,812
Get.
- Bite me,

898
00:59:34,812 --> 00:59:36,262
red state creeper.

899
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,198
Did you see that trench
coat he's wearing,

900
00:59:41,198 --> 00:59:43,096
it's like 100 degrees out here.

901
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:45,616
- Let's get back to LA
where the normal people are.

902
00:59:47,514 --> 00:59:50,172
[ominous music]

903
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:05,015
- Oh, that's Anna's nose ring.

904
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:07,120
- It can't be.

905
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,572
- Oh my god.

906
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:12,160
- What?
- Oh my god.

907
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:14,265
[Ashley screaming]

908
01:00:14,265 --> 01:00:15,853
- Oh, oh God!
- Oh!

909
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:18,718
[Rita screaming]

910
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:20,927
- Oh my god!
- Oh!

911
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:21,928
- Oh my god.

912
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:26,623
- Oh!
- Oh my god!

913
01:00:27,485 --> 01:00:30,040
[Rick gagging]

914
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:35,908
- It's okay, it's okay.

915
01:00:35,908 --> 01:00:36,736
[Rick hollering]

916
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:37,703
- Oh god!

917
01:00:37,703 --> 01:00:40,153
Who could have done this?

918
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:41,361
Oh god, oh god.

919
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:45,883
[Rick hollers]

920
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,542
Oh we gotta go, we
gotta go, go go!

921
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:50,508
We gotta go!

922
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:54,789
[ominous music]

923
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:16,500
- No sign of James anywhere.

924
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,502
- Maybe he got away.
- Let's hope he did.

925
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:21,332
- I can't believe
someone would hurt Anna,

926
01:01:21,332 --> 01:01:23,403
poor Anna who
wouldn't harm a fly.

927
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:28,098
- Wait, wait, wait,
no what are you doing?

928
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:29,651
- I'm letting him out.

929
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:31,101
- No, no, no, no, I don't
think that's a good idea.

930
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,379
- Are you serious, you can't
just leave him in there to die.

931
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:35,933
Austin, what's gotten into you.

932
01:01:37,348 --> 01:01:39,765
- If we untie him the
first thing he's gonna do

933
01:01:39,765 --> 01:01:40,697
is start a fight.

934
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,870
We don't have time for that.

935
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,115
- He's right, Ashley, it's
just safer for everyone

936
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:46,461
if he just stays in there.

937
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,845
- I can't believe you two.

938
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,605
- Why what's wrong?
- I don't know.

939
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,380
What?

940
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:00,224
Guys, the car won't start.

941
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:05,367
- I never should have come here.

942
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:07,507
All I wanted to do
was have a fun weekend

943
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:09,406
and just meet a few new people

944
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:11,822
and this phone, it
just won't work.

945
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:13,720
- No one knew this would happen.

946
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,722
- You girls were
messing with things

947
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:17,069
that you shouldn't have.

948
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:18,311
None of this would be
happening right now

949
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:20,589
if it wasn't for
that seance, okay?

950
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:23,040
We let him out and now
he's just gonna pick us off

951
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,801
one by one like he
did in that video.

952
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,321
- We still don't know
who is doing this, okay?

953
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:29,806
For all we know someone
could have just been watching

954
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,015
this place for years just
waiting for occupants

955
01:03:32,015 --> 01:03:34,224
to play their sick,
twisted games on.

956
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:36,640
- But you saw Anna,
no human being

957
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,572
could have done that to her.

958
01:03:37,572 --> 01:03:39,608
- I don't know what to think.

959
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:42,059
Yeah, but there is always
a rational explanation

960
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:44,268
for everything, none
of this is real.

961
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,135
- You said you believed it.

962
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:50,827
- I told you what you
wanted to hear, okay?

963
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,036
- [Ashley] You mean
you never believed me?

964
01:03:53,036 --> 01:03:54,969
- It's just what
boyfriends do, okay,

965
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:56,971
they bend the truth once
in awhile if it makes

966
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:58,282
your loved ones feel better.

967
01:03:58,282 --> 01:04:01,976
It's just a little white
lie, it's no harm done.

968
01:04:01,976 --> 01:04:03,425
Ashley, Ashley
where are you going?

969
01:04:03,425 --> 01:04:05,462
- I'm checking on Meghan,
okay, she needs me.

970
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:17,854
- We need to figure
out what to do.

971
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,028
- Night is approaching
and we're 30 miles away

972
01:04:20,028 --> 01:04:21,788
from civilization.

973
01:04:21,788 --> 01:04:23,998
Are you sure we
can't start the car?

974
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:27,415
- There's no battery,
Greg, someone took it.

975
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:36,631
No, no, we stay here
and we hike out at dawn.

976
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:40,635
- If we stay then we're
just sitting ducks,

977
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:42,499
okay, why don't we just
hike back to the highway

978
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:44,777
and walk all night if
it takes us that long?

979
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:47,676
- No, we're safer here.

980
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:52,681
Whoever killed Anna
is still out there

981
01:04:55,098 --> 01:04:59,033
and we have weapons
for protection.

982
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:02,968
And we stay put and we
hike out at first light.

983
01:05:04,107 --> 01:05:07,351
- Weapons, what weapons, this?

984
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:10,113
[metal clanking]

985
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,298
[ominous music]

[blood splatters]
[Dan moaning]

990
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:06,583
- Did you lock the
kitchen window?

991
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,586
- I locked it.
- Is everything else secure?

992
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:10,863
- As secure as can be.

993
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:16,558
Nobody's gonna be able to reach
us here, we're too high up.

994
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:21,287
- How's she doing?

995
01:06:21,287 --> 01:06:22,806
- She's a little.
- I'm fine.

996
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:33,437
Anna, I can't believe it.

997
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,373
- Any word on James?
- Nothing.

998
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:39,719
- We've gotta do something.

999
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,760
- Before there were some
bullets for that gun.

1000
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,935
- Yeah, there might
be some somewhere.

1001
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,112
Let's split up into groups
and search the house.

1002
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:11,544
[climactic music]

1003
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,067

[Jeff gurgling]

[Jeff's girlfriend screaming]

1010
01:07:56,727 --> 01:07:59,282
[Jeff gasping]

1011
01:08:10,776 --> 01:08:12,191
- Any luck?
- No.

1012
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:17,576
- Oh I think I see
something outside.

1013
01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:27,724
[door knocking]
[group hollers]

1014
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:29,105
- What is that?

1015
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,142
- No, don't let it in.
- What, it?

1016
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:33,592
- No, no, no, what
if it was James?

1017
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:35,870
- Please, don't open the door,

1018
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,803
you have to trust me okay?

1019
01:08:37,803 --> 01:08:40,185
- Ashley, we need to
do a protection spell.

1020
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,674
- What's gotten into this?

1021
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:12,044
- We need to paint this symbol
next to every entry point.

1022
01:10:02,059 --> 01:10:06,202
- You know, I was just
thinking the shed had

1023
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:11,207
some better weapons,
saws, drills, power tools.

1024
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,209
- It's not safe out there.

1025
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,385
- I think it's worth a shot.

1026
01:10:18,283 --> 01:10:19,215
- I'll go with you.

1027
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:39,787
- The spell won't protect
us unless we remain inside.

1028
01:10:39,787 --> 01:10:43,756
- She's right, we're only
protected in this cabin.

1029
01:10:57,943 --> 01:11:00,532
[ominous music]

1030
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:16,479

[door slamming]

1032
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,327
- Damn kids.

1033
01:11:44,783 --> 01:11:46,854
Dispatch come in,
this is officer 299,

1034
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:50,271
I have a 502 about
three miles north

1035
01:11:52,515 --> 01:11:53,309
of I-37 Park Bench Grill.

1036
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:58,521
Possible 503 intoxication,
dispatch two over.

1037
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:03,940
- [Dispatch] Copy 299,
you need a bus, over.

1038
01:12:04,975 --> 01:12:07,046
- Negative, dispatch,
car's empty.

1039
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:10,671
Starting a 10 mile
perimeter search over.

1040
01:12:22,786 --> 01:12:23,615
Damn kids.

1041
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:43,151
- Salt keeps out evil spirits.

1042
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:48,225
- Oh my god, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1043
01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:53,990
- What about the
guy in the shed?

1044
01:12:55,336 --> 01:12:56,130
- He's uh.

1045
01:13:02,826 --> 01:13:04,034
- So what do we do now?

1046
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:05,242
- We wait.

1047
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,319
[door banging]

1048
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:15,529
- Help, let me in [indistinct]!

1049
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:18,704
- Well, we can't just
leave her out there.

1050
01:13:18,704 --> 01:13:23,157
- I don't think that's such
a good idea, wait Austin.

1051
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,438
- He killed Jeff!

1052
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:33,236
He pulled him away [indistinct].

1053

we can do about it?

do we send him back.

some way to recapture him?

never done anything like that.

entrapment spell.

1080
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,096
- It's a spell to
capture a spirit.

1081

soul into the item

1082

Now we just need
something to seal it with.

was crazy but I didn't.

I saw something different,
misunderstood genius, a hero.

1121
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:49,508
When I first moved over
here, no one noticed me,

1122
01:19:50,475 --> 01:19:51,476
but Norman did.

1123

He could have kicked me off his
property but he let me stay.

taught me things no one else

I'm the one who
brought Norman back.

I collected some of
his blood in this vile.

1130
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,020
And I made a promise to him

1131

him back, not you.

is inside Meghan's body,

then tied them and bagged them.

I let them try and run away
