0
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,113
We will never understand
his earthly struggles,

1
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:58,852
but have faith his soul
is in good hands.

2
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,854
So we remember
a business partner,

3
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,691
a brother, and a husband.

4
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:06,024
We say goodbye
to Jeffrey Scott Fredericks

5
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,060
and ask that he finds mercy
in the heavens.

6
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,128
Amen.

7
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,636
Thank you so much for coming.

8
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,310
Nobody wants to be around him,
even in death.

9
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,213
We want to support you, Claire.

10
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:21,512
Well, he's not suffering now.

11
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:23,877
He's watching over me.

12
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,584
No, he's not.

13
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:31,225
At this very second,
I can see him burning

14
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,689
in the pits of Hell
for all eternity.

15
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:35,328
Rosalie.

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,664
Thank you both for coming in.

17
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,096
I'm sure you have
some questions for me.

18
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,098
How bad is it, Dr. Warren?

19
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,837
Well, is this
a normal occurrence

20
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,740
that you get called
to Rosalie's schools

21
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:53,544
to discuss her behavior?

22
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:57,680
She's had such a tough time
adjusting to the new school.

23
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:00,749
I tried to pull her record...

24
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:15,632
Ugh! Ugh.

25
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,569
Ugh!

26
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:21,231
Ahhhh!

27
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,200
Wahhhh!

28
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,873
There it is, there it is,
there it is.

29
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,449
I said I tried to pull her
records from Shanesville.

30
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:33,782
Problem is, I couldn't even find
a city with that name.

31
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:37,148
Oh, uh, it's, um,
outside of Des Moines.

32
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,393
Uh, unincorporated, though,
so it... it never shows up.

33
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,627
She was home-schooled
while we were there, so...

34
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:46,091
Rosalie exhibits
characteristics

35
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,336
of some in my field could call
an emotional disorder.

36
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:52,306
There are signs of psychopathy,
as well as evidence

37
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:56,574
of interacting with identities
that are not present.

38
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,237
Are you saying she's like
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde?

39
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:03,515
It's a misconception that
multiple personality disorder

40
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,176
is the same as schizophrenia.

41
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,586
Schizophrenia is when
the patient sees and hears

42
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,247
things that are not there.

43
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:12,117
And I'm sorry to say,
but I do believe

44
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,789
that this characterizes Rosalie.

45
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,989
Well, uh, thank you
for your time, Doctor.

46
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:18,464
I-I-It can't be easy
to do your job.

47
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,257
But I haven't even begun.

48
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,194
There are treatments
for this disorder

49
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,801
that I feel would best benefit
Rosalie's...

50
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:28,166
We're... We're moving again.

51
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,609
- What? So soon?
- With my job, I-I don't choose.

52
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:34,040
I get sent.
We are going to get help

53
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:36,647
for her as soon
as we get settled.

54
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:39,716
Thank you, Doctor.

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,365
Rosalie? How ya doin', honey?

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,367
You excited to move
to a new town?

57
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,544
♪ Who's my baby ♪

58
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,010

63
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:26,532
No, silly. I'm Rosalie.

64
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,831
- Oh!
- Oops!

65
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,982
You don't want that.

66
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,654
Trust me.

67
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,956
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

68
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:31,124
Trust me,
I'm the one doing you the favor.

69
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,431
It's lovely.

70
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:42,971
It is nice.

71
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,009
Won't be long now, Rosalie.

72
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,527
Isn't it cute?

73
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:03,189
It<i> is</i> cute.

74
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,467
Hey, hey!

75
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,007
Betty Goss.

76
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,437
Brand-new, right?

77
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,550
Welcome!
Welcome!

78
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:26,949
- Thank you.
- And who might you be? Hmm?

79
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:29,853
Oh, this is our daughter,
Rosalie.

80
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,657
Oh!

81
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,022
- The move and all...
- Oh, of course.

82
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:37,322
Hey, heads up... we take care
of our own around here.

83
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,489
You know that saying,
"It takes a village"?

84
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:42,294
Well, we put other
neighborhood watches to shame.

85
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:46,540
If it happens around here,
it's in "The Mirror."

86
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,003
Wh... That's our newspaper.

87
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,008
I didn't catch your names.

88
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:55,912
I'm Theresa Snyder.
This is my husband, Daniel.

89
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:59,146
Hi. Oh, Catholic, huh?

90
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,478
Now, St. Peters is the only
Catholic Church in town,

91
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,481
but Father Paul is the<i> best.</i>
Oh.

92
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:08,155
Why are you...
wearing your rosary?

93
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,157
It makes me feel closer to Him.

94
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:13,765
Oh!
Well, I'm not one to judge,

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,736
but there are those who say
that is just not done.

96
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:21,036
Yeah, uh, we better get
all our stuff in the house.

97
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:24,534
Well, I'm just down the street
if you ever need anything.

98
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,779
We're<i> very</i> tight-knit
around here.

99
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:31,079
We keep watch after our own.

100
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:33,587
Buh-bye!

101
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,693
Spiritual healing.

102
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,553
Maybe they got something
that could actually help her.

103
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:47,128
Maybe.

104
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:50,395
This is the kind of town
I could really settle down in.

105
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:55,070
Don't get attached.
I'm here for work.

106
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:05,949
Soon, I promise.

107
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,481
We'll be on
the other side of this.

108
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,255
Guys, look at the frog!

109
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,828
- Gross! Get it!
- Let's go!

110
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:18,588
- Get it. Get it.
- Come on! Get him!

111
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:20,766
It's so cute.

112
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:31,601
Ew, gross!

113
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:33,141
Ugh!

114
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:36,441
- Ew, gross!
- Disgusting!

115
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:59,002
Honey, go inside.
Mommy's gonna dry you off.

116
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,143
Did you make some new friends?

117
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,657
Go on.

118
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:36,633
Hey! Just wanted to welcome
you guys to town.

119
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:37,711
John Driscoll.

120
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,175
- Oh, come on in.
- Thank you.

121
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,882
Daniel Snyder.
This is my wife, Theresa.

122
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,675
Nice to meet you, John.

123
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,722
Ah. What brings you folks here
from Des Moines?

124
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:53,221
How'd you know we came
from Des Moines?

125
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:54,519
- License plate.
- Ah.

126
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,829
I used to live in Iowa.

127
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,556
Uh, job.

128
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,493
I'm gonna be working at
Dynata Tech, insurance division.

129
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,529
Oh, nice.
Not too far from the plant.

130
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,597
I'm foreman there.

131
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,269
Well, listen, I didn't come here

132
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:10,205
to take over the world
or anything.

133
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:15,210
Just came to introduce myself
and welcome you to the 'hood.

134
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:18,180
Hey, join me for a beer anytime.

135
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,786
Will do.

136
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:06,063
You're the one
saying "Don't become attached"

137
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:07,625
because there's a job to do."

138
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,934
The faster you work,

139
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,760
the sooner we'll be able
to help her.

140
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,070
This is a process.

141
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:15,138
We have to make sure
the job is done<i> right.</i>

142
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:16,942
You know how to do the job!

143
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:19,142
There has to be another way!

144
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:29,020
I'll start tomorrow.
I promise.

145
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,022
Come on. Come on, baby.

146
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:38,293
Oh, hey, hi.

147
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:40,427
Harlan Lester.

148
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:42,462
- Daniel Snyder.
- Yeah, yeah.

149
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:44,365
Hey, listen, uh, my mother...

150
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,797
She's making her famous, uh,
chicken and trifle tonight.

151
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:50,008
She insists that you
and your family

152
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:53,275
just come on over,
and John will be there, too.

153
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,574
- Uh...
- Mother insists.

154
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,611
Sounds good.

155
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,316
Very good.

156
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,649
Speak of the devil. Okay.

157
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,024
Betty, what happened?

158
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,817
Mrs. Henderson
had a heart attack.

159
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,555
I mean, who didn't see that
coming, huh?

160
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,491
Oh, that's terrible.

161
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:46,592
Yeah, pretty bad.

162
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,693
Thank you.

163
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,233
Wait right there.

164
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:51,839
Break room's straight ahead,
and, of course,

165
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:55,205
don't hesitate to reach out
if you need any support.

166
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,207
Thank you, Mr. Woronicz.
I appreciate that.

167
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,945
Please. Gary.

168
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:03,180
Love your briefcase. Classy.

169
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:06,678
It'll make a great impression on
clients when you do house calls.

170
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,054
People tend to get, uh, weary

171
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:11,254
of the dreaded
insurance salesman.

172
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,458
Are you okay?

173
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,627
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

174
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,036
Sales is not for everyone,

175
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,401
especially door-to-door.
Ilt's good.

176
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,865
I've been doing it a long time.
I-I know how to close.

177
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,274
Well, then,
I'll leave you to it.

178
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,540
Welcome to the playground.

179
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:48,456
Well, aren't you three
a lovely family?

180
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,062
Adorable.

181
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,724
- They're joining the parish!
- Oh, wonderful!

182
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,824
Ooh, Catholic!

183
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,134
Oh, speaking of adorable,

184
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,796
Tammy Reid called
Kathy Weisman...

185
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,139
She's Jewish...

186
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,174
Started calling
her daughter adorable,

187
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,341
and Kathy just went all...
I understand you do

188
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,607
life insurance
for people my age?

189
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:09,906
Oh, her premium is
ri-donk-ulous,

190
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:13,118
as they say on the streets.

191
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,944
He would love to.

192
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,188
If you have 15 minutes
of free time,

193
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:19,256
he could do a profile on you.

194
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,818
Right, honey?

195
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,657
Uh, sure.

196
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,033
Since my son will be
abandoning me

197
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:29,431
for his sacred bowling
tomorrow night,

198
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,796
I get home from bingo at-00.

199
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,963
Oh, but then I have to
feed Zeus.

200
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:38,110
- That's my kitty.
- I'd like-30, to be safe.

201
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,805
No problem.- 30 it is.

202
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,511
Cats make the best pets.

203
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:45,942
Yes, they do, sweetie.

204
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:47,779
They serve Him well.

205
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,781
Serve who, sweetie?

206
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,388
The Dark Lord.

207
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:53,851
Rosalie.

208
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,227
You are excused.

209
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:57,789
Now.

210
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,168
What in the Jiminy Crickets
was that?

211
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:06,171
Your, uh, daughter<i> always</i>
talk like that,

212
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,502
Mr. and Mrs. Snyder?

213
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:09,537
She's having such a rough time

214
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:11,176
adjusting
to the new environment.

215
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,970
I'm, uh, thinking about
taking her to the reservation.

216
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,741
- No!
- No!

217
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,512
Not the best idea.

218
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:20,185
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
It's just legend.

219
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,980
The reservation
does not respect this town.

220
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,553
You know, some people say
they're evil,

221
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,687
but I don't get involved
with the gossip.

222
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:29,425
They're just not good people.

223
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,494
Bad things happen to anyone
who associates.

224
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,332
Uh, look at Roger Stenson

225
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,202
and Charlie Furber.

226
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:39,831
The Leavenger family.

227
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,801
What... What happened to them?

228
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:48,411
Each visited the reservation
at some point in time.

229
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:51,381
Every time after each visited,

230
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,549
one bad thing after another.

231
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:56,848
Now, I don't want to use
the word "curse."

232
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,883
It's a strong word, but, well...

233
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,754
Young lady,
you and your husband

234
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,625
best stay<i> away</i> from that place.

235
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,298
It's cursed.

236
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,729
That is a strong word, Mother.

237
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:11,830
It's cursed!

238
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,713
I suppose the kid jumped!

239
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:33,720
You can't just throw someone
out of a tree house

240
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,458
because you don't like them.

241
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:37,460
He could have been killed,
honey.

242
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:39,231
He wasn't.

243
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,771
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

244
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,344
Oh, no problem.

245
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,940
I'm so glad you finally accepted
my play-date invite.

246
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,975
Sorry it took so long.

247
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,650
We haven't had a lot of time
for play dates lately.

248
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,752
Must be so hard
being the new kid in town.

249
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:09,162
It's fine. An adjustment.

250
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:10,955
It's a process.

251
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,629
Can I ask you
a personal question?

252
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:16,961
I... suppose.

253
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,503
Do you ever feel like
the walking dead?

254
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,772
I mean, since I had Anna,
I just...

255
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:28,610
zone out, you know? Like I...

256
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,008
feel like I'm just
going through the motions

257
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,253
and waiting for my life
to finish its course.

258
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:43,262
Well, I-I think that feeling
wears off after time, Alice.

259
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,433
We have to do more of these.

260
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:53,030
Yeah.

261
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,011
She's getting worse.
Did you see her face?

262
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,017
What if she's doing
these things?

263
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,392
What if she did it?

264
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,559
It's not<i> her.</i>

265
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:51,594
She's my baby, too.

266
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:55,631
If you don't do your job,
we're going to lose her forever.

267
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,276
Rosalie, are you excited
to learn about

268
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,971
the first people
to ever live on this land?

269
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:07,643
No.

270
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,322
- Rosalie!
- No! No! No! No!

271
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:17,653
No! No!
Rosalie! Stop it!

272
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:19,248
Stop it now!

273
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:53,018
There is no hope for her here.

274
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,690
She must leave.

275
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:59,288
Please.

276
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:03,028
I will speak with<i> you,</i>
and you only.

277
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:05,129
But she has to go.

278
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:16,305
It's okay.
Um, we'll wait at the car.

279
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,109
No.

280
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,013
She cannot be on these grounds.

281
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,736
Come.

282
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:53,782
Sit.

283
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:59,656
How did you know
who my daughter was?

284
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:01,218
Oh, I didn't.

285
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,924
I felt her... her evil...

286
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,498
The second
she got out of that car.

287
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,160
And she can never step foot
on these grounds again.

288
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,898
That's not her.

289
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:15,441
You... are not evil.

290
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,905
I see you suffer.

291
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,612
But I can't see all of you.

292
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:24,912
Why did you invite me in here
if she can't be saved?

293
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:28,179
Ah. I didn't say that
she can't be saved.

294
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:31,787
And I-I don't know
that she<i> can</i> be saved.

295
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:36,385
I said she cannot
step foot on these grounds.

296
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,466
Your daughter is going to
destroy you and her mother.

297
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:44,360
If she can be saved... how?

298
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:47,605
- You must reclaim her.
- Reclaim?

299
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,233
I don't know what that means.

300
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:53,809
Are you a-a-a witch
or something?

301
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,912
I guess some would say so.

302
00:22:57,947 --> 00:23:01,311
I'm a seer. I practice the arts.

303
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,313
Mm. The dark arts?

304
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,591
There is no dark
without the light.

305
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:09,022
It's all a part
of the same circle.

306
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:12,058
If you are in a dark room,

307
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:15,325
the darkest of dark rooms,

308
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,965
as dark as a black hole,

309
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,771
you could bring the tiniest
pinprick of light.

310
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:27,612
Tiniest match can lead you all
out of the darkness.

311
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:31,781
It's what you do with it
that determines what it is.

312
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,915
Magic?

313
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,521
Everything is magic.

314
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:38,821
And there's no such thing
as magic.

315
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:42,154
I... I'm called Floating Hawk.

316
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:44,629
People say your land
is cursed.

317
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:47,093
One man's curse
is another man's blessing.

318
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:49,634
I'm not into riddles.
I want my daughter back.

319
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,438
You are not in any position
to be making demands,

320
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:53,000
are you, Daniel?

321
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:57,103
And until you are
100% transparent with me,

322
00:23:57,138 --> 00:24:00,843
only then perhaps we can have
a heart-to-heart.

323
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:05,617
Go. Clear your head.

324
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,378
Then return.

325
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,787
Know this...

326
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:14,153
Only death can save her.

327
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:17,123
Only death can set her free.

328
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:41,411
Harlan?

329
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,556
What happened to bowling night?

330
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:45,217
The storm?

331
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,453
Harlan?

332
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:06,711
How can we know
what she meant?

333
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:10,275
And why are you<i> so</i> willing
to trust this woman?

334
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,947
You know we made a deal.

335
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:14,213
We really don't have any
other choice but to honor it.

336
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:16,248
How's that been working out
for us so far?

337
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:19,691
Nothing we've ever done
has made any difference.

338
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,418
And what she is suggesting?

339
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,761
Rosalie must die
in order to be saved?

340
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:24,960
Are you insane?

341
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,357
She didn't say
Rosalie must die.

342
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,194
She said, "Only death
will save her."

343
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,031
Something about reclaiming.

344
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:31,868
I want to go back,
find out more.

345
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:35,773
Just... Just be open.
That's all I'm asking!

346
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:37,467
I don't know.

347
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,750
I want our daughter back.

348
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,449
Look at her.

349
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:56,761
She's gone.

350
00:25:56,796 --> 00:25:58,829
I want her back, too.

351
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:04,296
Do what you want.

352
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:06,562
But, in the meantime,

353
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,839
<i>please...</i>

354
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:11,501
let's just do
what we<i> have</i> to do.

355
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:46,503
Just sell her insurance.

356
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,851
Insurance.

357
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:04,554
Mrs. Lester?

358
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,160
Hello?

359
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:07,557
Mrs. Lester?

360
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,738
No, no, no, no, no!

361
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,102
It's impossible.

362
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:49,500
My mother would never
commit suicide.

363
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:53,075
She's Catholic.
She would never disobey God.

364
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,913
A-A-And did you see
how high that branch was?

365
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:58,674
80 year-old woman gonna
c-climb up that?

366
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:01,512
Give me a break.

367
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:12,864
Hi. Thank you
for inviting me in.

368
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,393
Lovely day, isn't it?

369
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,395
I think this is gonna save you
a lot of trouble,

370
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,464
and mutually beneficial
to the both of us.

371
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:21,103
What a lovely home.

372
00:28:21,138 --> 00:28:23,039
I hope that you can keep it.

373
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:25,470
I think that you can,
if you sign this.

374
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,978
Well, at this point, I don't
really have a choice, do I?

375
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:29,441
No, you don't.

376
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,047
Yeah.

377
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:32,378
Sign.

378
00:28:41,994 --> 00:28:45,424
No graveyard shift tonight?

379
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,063
Day off.

380
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:48,559
Man, I-I'm sorry.

381
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,430
Nah, I can't sleep.

382
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,300
Beer thirty?

383
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:55,071
Sure.

384
00:28:58,307 --> 00:29:00,769
I know some people already
suspect you for what happened.

385
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:02,914
But could've been me who went
to her house tonight.

386
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,280
People are crazy.

387
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:10,581
Mm. That old bat Betty Goss says
shit like, uh,

388
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,121
"All the bad stuff
started happening"

389
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:14,288
when you guys got here.

390
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:15,861
Yeah, right, Betty.

391
00:29:15,896 --> 00:29:17,621
Like nothing bad
ever happened here

392
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,832
before the Snyders got here.

393
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:22,758
Get a life,
you bag of smoked lard.

394
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:29,171
What's eatin' you, brother?

395
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:33,703
I'm sorry I said all that
about the bad stuff happening...

396
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,848
No, no, it's alright.

397
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:38,015
It's alright.

398
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,050
Want another one?

399
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:41,854
Sure.

400
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:47,651
Yeah, this town's
a cesspool of gossip.

401
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,664
Gotta run to the outside fridge.
Be back in a minute.

402
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,226
Yeah. No prob.

403
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,721
Exploring?

404
00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:02,033
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,365
It looks like you got
some cool relics there.

406
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,895
Curious, you know,
where they came from

407
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,897
and, uh, what they mean.

408
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:10,635
All the relics
have different meanings,

409
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,276
but the coolest one

410
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:16,575
was the one you were looking at.

411
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,126
How do you know which one
I was looking at?

412
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,051
Because it moved.

413
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:24,913
Wow. You're good.

414
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,751
No, this particular one
is an ancient relic

415
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:31,425
discovered in Mesopotamia.

416
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,967
It's said to be a tool of
The Harbinger.

417
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:40,005
The Harbinger is like a sign
or omen of things to come.

418
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,238
In this particular myth,
the Harbinger

419
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:45,274
is a traveler doomed to Hell

420
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:48,343
unless he does
the devil's bidding.

421
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:51,907
And with him...

422
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:54,151
comes damnation.

423
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:56,153
For what purpose?

424
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:58,089
Try to get as many people
as possible

425
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:02,159
to kill themselves
so he can claim their souls.

426
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:04,755
How do they get people
to kill themselves?

427
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,658
The serpent relic.

428
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:09,199
It's pure evil, forged in Hell,

429
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:12,202
and influences people
to commit suicide.

430
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:14,699
The Harbinger's job
is to drop the relic

431
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,833
within the vicinity
of the victims.

432
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,770
Why... Why can't he just
kill the people?

433
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,047
He can, but just because
he kills them

434
00:32:22,082 --> 00:32:23,807
doesn't mean he gets them.

435
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:28,317
Your only way to true damnation
is through suicide.

436
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:31,815
And, uh, he'll stop at nothing
to get you there.

437
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,159
He, uh, can't just drop
the relic himself?

438
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:38,624
Why does he need Harbingers?
To cover more ground.

439
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,890
He sends one Harbinger
to each town.

440
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,397
But there are too many towns,

441
00:32:42,432 --> 00:32:44,366
so he's always looking
for more Harbingers.

442
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:47,534
He uses leverage to get people
to sign the contracts,

443
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,734
people who have done bad things

444
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,242
or made bad deals,
what have you.

445
00:32:52,277 --> 00:32:55,509
If he can hold something
over your head,

446
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:57,346
he's got you.

447
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:01,152
So these Harbingers...
They go around

448
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,550
to all these different towns
to get as many people

449
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:06,322
to off themselves as possible.

450
00:33:06,357 --> 00:33:08,225
And if they don't?

451
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,721
Hell if I know.

452
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:10,931
Wait a second. Wait a second.

453
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,890
You have the tool
of the Harbinger,

454
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,036
the serpent relic,
in your house.

455
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,764
Why haven't you killed yourself?

456
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,607
You... What...
You don't really believe

457
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,378
all that malarkey, do you?

458
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:32,711
I mean, I guess if a Catholic
commits suicide,

459
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:35,043
going against God and all that,

460
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:37,452
but then again,
to try to get me to believe

461
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:39,256
that there's some dude
working for the devil

462
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,226
who can make you kill yourself
using some little trinket?

463
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:45,856
Well, gotta be Linda Lovelace
to swallow that pill.

464
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,364
Makes for a cool story, though.

465
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,532
Ah, here.

466
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:58,440
You can have this one.

467
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,715
Doesn't do jack shit,
but, uh, well, it looks cool.

468
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,609
What are you guys doing?

469
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:50,789
Honey, have you seen
my briefcase?

470
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:08,873
Mr. Snyder.

471
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:10,842
Uh, Detective Tracy Hennings.

472
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,349
You mind if I have
a quick moment?

473
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:13,614
Uh, no, not at all.

474
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:14,846
Uh, I got your statements.

475
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,815
I just wanted to confirm
something.

476
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,861
Now, you said you saw Harlan
<i>after</i> you found Mrs. Lester.

477
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,357
Is that right?

478
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:21,853
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

479
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:24,361
I, uh, called out
and no one answered.

480
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:27,298
Mm. Any chance he could have
been inside the house

481
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,235
and just not answered
when you called out?

482
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,469
I suppose he could have been.
I really don't know.

483
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,241
Did... Did you ask him?
Oh, we will.

484
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:38,001
We will.

485
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,311
You said you're from a town
in Iowa called Huntsville.

486
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,071
Is that right?
Yes. That's right.

487
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,578
Well, here's the thing.

488
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:46,251
I can't find a Huntsville
in Iowa anywhere.

489
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:49,518
Well, I-it's, uh, more of
an unincorporated area.

490
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:51,223
I-I just say Des Moines.

491
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:53,852
Ah! I gotcha.

492
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:56,426
Ah, just one more thing.

493
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:57,889
Now, where is it?

494
00:35:57,924 --> 00:36:01,431
Des Moines, huh?
Everybody knows where that is.

495
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:03,532
Ah, here it is.

496
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,996
Uh, does this mean anything
to you?

497
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,406
Uh, no, sir.
Where'd you find that?

498
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:12,343
At the crime scene, obviously.

499
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,378
Crime scene?

500
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:16,413
I thought she committed suicide.

501
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:18,943
Well, here's another thing.

502
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:20,780
It's troubling.

503
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,055
How does an 80-year-old woman
get up in a tree like that?

504
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:28,260
Well, you think of anything
you want to tell me,

505
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:31,263
anything at all, you go ahead
and give me a call.

506
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:34,057
Thank you, Detective. Will do.

507
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,762
Okay.

508
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:21,973
What do you want from me?!

509
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:43,335
What is it?

510
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,864
I can't find the girls
anywhere.

511
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,349
They were playing in the back
near the woods,

512
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:48,164
and I am this close
to calling the police.

513
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:51,772
- Rosalie!
- Anna!

514
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:53,301
Mommy!

515
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:55,479
Ah!

516
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:58,680
Anna!

517
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:00,451
What did I say
about these tunnels?

518
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,981
I couldn't stop her, Mommy.
She just kept going.

519
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:05,885
I told her about the ghosts,
and she wouldn't listen.

520
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,722
Ghosts?

521
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:10,395
Mobsters in the Prohibition Era
used to hide from the cops

522
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,364
in these old mining tunnel
systems.

523
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,366
People like to say
the town is haunted,

524
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:16,896
but we know that's just stories,
now, don't we, girls?

525
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,063
Yes, Mommy.

526
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,265
Right, Rosalie?

527
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,203
The Harbinger has come.

528
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,976
He is here.

529
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:32,582
What's a Harbinger?

530
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:35,684
It's something she read
and keeps repeating.

531
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,895
Have you cleared your head?

532
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,436
Floating Hawk, I have, uh,

533
00:38:51,471 --> 00:38:55,165
never been one
to be 100% transparent.

534
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,607
In my life, I have had

535
00:38:57,642 --> 00:39:00,775
so many people to protect.

536
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,447
But I failed.

537
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:04,911
Good, Daniel. Keep going.

538
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,848
Nothing personal.
I have trust issues.

539
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:09,949
I...

540
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:11,984
I don't know how to say this.

541
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,692
I don't know you.

542
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:18,089
Surely, you can understand

543
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:20,531
I am risking everything
by being here.

544
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:24,029
Little brother,
you've lost everything.

545
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:26,295
What else do you have to risk?

546
00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:30,937
The devil has
my daughter's soul.

547
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:34,237
And he has forced me to do
something terrible

548
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:37,482
in order to get her back.

549
00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:38,978
I will go to the ends
of the Earth

550
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:41,112
to find another way to save her.

551
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,983
Trust goes both ways, Daniel.

552
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:46,821
I still can't see all of you.

553
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:49,956
But I know what you say is true.

554
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:55,291
There is no prayer or chant
or spell or song

555
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,568
that can save your daughter.

556
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,473
Are you going to drown
in a puddle of tears,

557
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:03,233
or do you want to
try another way?

558
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,103
Hmm?

559
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:08,172
What I'm about to tell you
has never been verified,

560
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:09,976
not by me anyway.

561
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:12,616
Your people have a legend
of Ehud the Judge.

562
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:14,651
You know it?

563
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:19,821
An evil, fat king was killed
by a servant of God,

564
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:23,495
and the dagger expelled
the filth and dirt

565
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,157
from the king before he died.

566
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:30,766
As a girl, our elders told us
the story of that blessed dagger

567
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:32,999
being brought here by pilgrims.

568
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,870
It is now next to
the Auclair crypt

569
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:38,136
underneath the oval stone.

570
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:41,370
Our people respect the story
and never go near it.

571
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:45,143
Are you saying
a dagger to stab the devil?

572
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:47,816
No.

573
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:50,720
According to legend...

574
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:52,414
your daughter.

575
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:57,826
"Only death will save her."

576
00:40:57,861 --> 00:40:59,190
My daughter has to die?!

577
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:01,489
What the story
doesn't tell you...

578
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:04,030
It's the evil that dies.

579
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:07,737
But if the evil is expelled
and good remains,

580
00:41:07,772 --> 00:41:09,772
true life returns.

581
00:41:11,941 --> 00:41:14,007
That's a story.

582
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:16,174
There's no dagger.

583
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:18,979
Trust.

584
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:21,212
But verify.

585
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:25,513
If I stab my daughter
with a dagger, she's dead.

586
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:29,726
Yes, but there are two things
you must consider.

587
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:33,026
One... you have no other option.

588
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:36,392
And two... she's already dead.

589
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:38,058
<i>That blessed dagger is now
by the Auclair crypt,</i>

590
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:39,994
<i>underneath the oval stone.</i>

591
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:02,687
Ah!

592
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:04,249
What brings you to the party?

593
00:43:04,284 --> 00:43:07,252
You can't possibly know
anyone here, can you?

594
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:09,155
Oh! Shit.

595
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,959
How can I be such an idiot?

596
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:13,863
Mrs. Lester, right?

597
00:43:13,898 --> 00:43:15,964
Uh, yeah.

598
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:18,494
I'm sorry you had to be
the one to find her, man.

599
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:23,675
Come on.
Mrs. Lester's buried this way.

600
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:29,307
That other half of the cemetery
is on Indian land.

601
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:32,277
Supposedly cursed,
like they said the other night.

602
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:34,444
I don't really believe
that crap, but, uh,

603
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:40,285
still, you, uh, don't ever
want to dip a toe on that side,

604
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,288
not because it's cursed,
but, uh,

605
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:45,191
because then you have to
deal with them.

606
00:43:45,226 --> 00:43:48,227
Eh, and don't ever talk to them.

607
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:49,800
I don't really believe
they're evil,

608
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,396
but, uh, the ones not getting
the casino money

609
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:54,904
are just looking for a handout.

610
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:56,807
Trust me.

611
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:02,373
Well, I'm, uh... I'm really
sorry about Mrs. Lester.

612
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:05,882
If... If you don't mind,
I'm gonna stroll around.

613
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:09,215
I'm kind of a history buff.

614
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,085
You got it.

615
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,186
Don't beat yourself up, bud.

616
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:15,188
Thanks, John.

617
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,903
Oh, God, no.

618
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:15,479
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

619
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:17,954
Amen. Go in peace, my child.

620
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,286
Would you bless this, too,
Father?

621
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:31,330
You must leave these premises.

622
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:34,597
I assure you
she is a sweet child.

623
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:37,974
She's just a little lost.

624
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:43,441
Please bless us.

625
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,950
Leave this place!

00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:14,394
Got interrupted.

647
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:15,824
Well, it's always something.

648
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,727
His granddaughter showed up.

649
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:19,597
I can't bring myself to do
any of these jobs.

650
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:22,171
You don't have a choice.

651
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:26,010
Just do the job
so that we can get her back.

652
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:28,474
I can't. I<i> won't.</i>

653
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:30,740
I<i> have</i> to find another way.

654
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:34,084
When are you gonna accept
there<i> is</i> no other way?

655
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,648
Never.
I will never accept that.

656
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:40,915
What you're toying with,
the risk...

657
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,588
It's... it's just too high.
How can you say that?!

658
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:45,326
You know, if you hadn't made

659
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:47,757
certain decisions
with your life,

660
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,133
we wouldn't be making this one
right now.

661
00:48:50,168 --> 00:48:52,927
Hey! I loved her, too!

662
00:48:52,962 --> 00:48:55,699
You think it doesn't torment me
every day?!

663
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:59,472
I go to sleep every night,
and I see her smiling face.

664
00:48:59,507 --> 00:49:03,113
I wake up thinking I'm gonna
see it again, only to realize

665
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,347
I'm in the same Goddamn
repeating nightmare!

666
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:08,382
And you don't think
I miss her?!

667
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:11,550
You don't think I'm heartbroken?
We are living in Hell on Earth.

668
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,189
<i>Daniel...</i>

669
00:49:19,098 --> 00:49:20,955
Baby, what's wrong?

670
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,661
I know of whom you speak.

671
00:49:23,696 --> 00:49:26,301
Mommy and Daddy
are not upset with you.

672
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,538
Where did you get that?

673
00:49:34,113 --> 00:49:36,377
The end of the tunnel.

674
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:20,751
Daniel?

675
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:22,390
What happened?

676
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:30,431
It was awful, Theresa.

677
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:33,434
But I have to.

678
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:36,030
I have to.

679
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:54,752
What can you tell me
about these objects?

680
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,464
You need to be very careful,
Daniel.

681
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:05,092
In the wrong hands,

682
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:09,470
these objects are dangerous,

683
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:12,737
deadly,

684
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:14,937
otherworldly.

685
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,643
You know the Harbinger myth?

686
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:21,152
I'm told one of these is
the tool of The Harbinger.

687
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:26,982
This is the tool
of The Harbinger.

688
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,325
I got something else for you.

689
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,336
You<i> are</i> a do-er, Daniel.

690
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:42,129
And you acquired this how?

691
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:44,234
My daughter says she found it
in the tunnels.

692
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,971
What?

693
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:51,809
Is there a way to test it?

694
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:54,141
I don't know.

695
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:57,353
I can't see.

696
00:51:57,388 --> 00:52:00,983
Part of the problem
is not the dagger.

697
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:02,655
It's you.

698
00:52:05,825 --> 00:52:07,429
Let me see.

699
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,309
I washed my hands.

700
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,070
It doesn't matter.
It's inappropriate.

701
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,875
- Yeah, Daddy.
- Yeah.

702
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,008
Whoa. Easy.

703
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:28,219
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

704
00:52:28,254 --> 00:52:29,847
Really?

705
00:52:29,882 --> 00:52:31,849
I had it,
but you overcorrected.

706
00:52:31,884 --> 00:52:35,523
Mm. Really?
How about you try some?

707
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:38,262
Oh! Somebody's toast!

708
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:39,593
She's toast!

709
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:41,397
No, no, no!

710
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:47,238
Your love is strong.

711
00:52:47,273 --> 00:52:50,604
Hey, this is actually
really good. Try some.

712
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:52,342
Aah!

713
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:56,346
Oh, we got two burnt pieces
of toast coming right up!

714
00:53:16,302 --> 00:53:19,270
The bald man...

715
00:53:19,305 --> 00:53:21,129
He scares you.

716
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:25,606
Come back when you are ready
to face him.

717
00:53:27,907 --> 00:53:31,106
Keep this safe.

718
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:43,981
Can you think of any enemies
you may have made

719
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:45,884
since you arrived to town?

720
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:47,523
No.

721
00:54:47,558 --> 00:54:49,723
Well, I will compile all this
in my report, ma'am,

722
00:54:49,758 --> 00:54:53,221
and get it submitted ASAP.

723
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,399
I'll just leave my card here
on the table.

724
00:54:58,668 --> 00:55:00,338
Thank you, Officer.

725
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:35,604
You just gonna spy on me
and my wife for eternity?

726
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:38,101
I have nothing to say to you.

727
00:55:38,136 --> 00:55:41,005
I didn't kill your mother.

728
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,975
Hey, neighbies. What's cookin'?

729
00:55:50,918 --> 00:55:54,216
Give him time, Daniel.

730
00:56:58,117 --> 00:57:01,789
<i>Daniel...</i>

731
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:13,636
<i>Daniel...</i>

732
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:40,223
Hi, honey.

733
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:44,359
Do you remember your daughter?

734
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,066
Yes.

735
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,710
Very much so.

736
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:56,910
Do you?

737
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:01,178
Not really.

738
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:26,170
♪ Who's my baby, baby,
baby, baby girl? ♪

739
00:58:26,205 --> 00:58:29,712
♪ Is it Rosalie? ♪

740
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:36,719
Please sleep,
my baby darling girl.

741
00:59:09,182 --> 00:59:12,953
Aah!

742
00:59:18,664 --> 00:59:20,730
Oh, my God.

743
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:42,411
Police are investigating...

744
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:52,025
What happened?

745
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,587
Like you don't know.

746
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:55,765
Stabbed in the eyes
with a letter opener.

747
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,163
Ma'am, let the investigation
disclose.

748
00:59:58,198 --> 01:00:00,671
You are not welcome
in this town!

749
01:00:00,706 --> 01:00:03,531
Take your murdering husband
and freak daughter

750
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,500
and get the hell outta here!
Ma'am, relax.

751
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:08,371
Yeah, put your tail between
your legs and run, bitch!

752
01:00:08,406 --> 01:00:10,043
Mr. Snyder!

753
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:17,886
Detective.

754
01:00:17,921 --> 01:00:20,053
Talk soon.

755
01:00:47,247 --> 01:00:48,576
Oh.

756
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,754
You didn't get my text?

757
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,547
No.

758
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:57,684
Uh... just with all of
the insanity,

759
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:00,324
Betty thought...

760
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:03,690
<i>I</i> think that we should just wait

761
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:05,527
for this whole thing
to blow over

762
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:08,167
before the girls...
Betty thought?

763
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:10,070
W-What whole thing?

764
01:01:10,105 --> 01:01:14,536
Theresa, please don't do this.

765
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:18,276
You have to admit that
Rosalie's...

766
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:20,509
I have to go.

767
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,511
Wh...

768
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:24,414
Alice!

769
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:26,988
It's a play date,
for God's sake!

770
01:01:29,157 --> 01:01:32,719
Go to hell, Alice!
You go to hell!

771
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:41,728
Betty is a mean person.

772
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:44,302
She will receive a comeuppance.

773
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:54,312
She's just scared, Theresa.
The whole town's on edge.

774
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,650
Hello.

775
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,322
Oh, evening, Detective.

776
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,161
Oh.

777
01:02:10,462 --> 01:02:12,297
I see.

778
01:02:12,332 --> 01:02:13,936
I'll be... I'll be right there.

779
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:18,765
He says Betty drove her car
off a cliff.

780
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:30,645
Come on, Daniel,
just level with me.

781
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,614
Help me help you.

782
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:34,352
I have no explanation,
Detective.

783
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:36,684
That's not gonna be
good enough.

784
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,929
Now, you're either committing
these acts, or you know who is,

785
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:43,526
unless you got someone who
really just doesn't like you.

786
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,495
I can't think of anyone.

787
01:02:48,874 --> 01:02:50,335
All right.

788
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:51,842
What do you know about this?

789
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:54,504
Found that in Betty's car.

790
01:03:07,189 --> 01:03:09,684
What is that?
What's that look on your face?

791
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,653
This doesn't make any sense.

792
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:13,457
Well, no shit, Shirley.

793
01:03:13,492 --> 01:03:15,162
Don't you think
it's in your best interest

794
01:03:15,197 --> 01:03:16,691
to just tell me what you know?

795
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:20,728
I'm sorry, Detective.
I-I have no clue. This...

796
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,533
Now, how do I know I'm gonna
find your DNA on this one, too?

797
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:25,667
You know, this is cause
for a warrant right here.

798
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:27,702
I was hoping you'd be
a little more cooperative.

799
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:29,924
I have no problem with you
obtaining a warrant, Detective.

800
01:03:29,948 --> 01:03:32,883
I have nothing to hide.

801
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:23,065
I've been seeing things.

802
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,530
I always do.

803
01:04:26,565 --> 01:04:29,137
What kind of things, sweetie?

804
01:04:29,172 --> 01:04:32,305
You know, if you wanted
to talk to us about anything,

805
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,374
ever, we're here for you.

806
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:37,981
You know that, right?

807
01:04:38,016 --> 01:04:41,215
There once was a cockroach
and a fly.

808
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,613
The fly said to the cockroach,

809
01:04:43,648 --> 01:04:45,483
"If you come into the house
with me,

810
01:04:45,518 --> 01:04:48,486
I'll share my take with you."

811
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:51,962
The cockroach said, "Sure,"
and went in with the fly.

812
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:55,592
As soon as they were
in the door,

813
01:04:55,627 --> 01:04:58,727
a boot smashed the cockroach.

814
01:04:58,762 --> 01:05:00,971
The fly flew to the kitchen,

815
01:05:01,006 --> 01:05:02,907
grabbed a piece of rancid
meat out of the garbage,

816
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:05,976
and flew to the door.

817
01:05:06,011 --> 01:05:10,178
But before he made it out
the door, it shut.

818
01:05:10,213 --> 01:05:12,510
The fly landed on the door,

819
01:05:12,545 --> 01:05:15,942
waiting for an opportunity
to escape.

820
01:05:15,977 --> 01:05:19,418
Then, smack!

821
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:22,883
A fly swatter splatted the fly's
guts all over the door.

822
01:05:24,557 --> 01:05:28,427
What's the point
of the story, honey?

823
01:05:28,462 --> 01:05:32,926
It doesn't matter if you are
the cockroach or the fly.

824
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:35,599
We all end up the same way.

825
01:05:39,506 --> 01:05:41,671
Good night.

826
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:46,577
My baby.

827
01:05:52,321 --> 01:05:54,816
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Ho!

828
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,192
Oh, hey, Danny.
Look what I got.

829
01:05:57,227 --> 01:05:59,458
Ask and you shall receive.

830
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:02,131
- Are you Snyder?
- Yes, sir.

831
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,694
I'm Sam Watkins,
a code investigator.

832
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:06,729
Your fence is not up to code,

833
01:06:06,764 --> 01:06:08,401
and your garage
is not up to code,

834
01:06:08,436 --> 01:06:10,568
and I have a city permit

835
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:13,901
to inspect your house.

836
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,838
Oh, this is
such petty bullshit!

837
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,049
When it rains it pours.
Go ahead, guys.

838
01:06:19,084 --> 01:06:20,479
Search the premises.

839
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:23,053
Search the place.
You, too, for all I care.

840
01:06:23,088 --> 01:06:25,682
But, let's just call this
what it is... a witch hunt!

841
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:27,354
Well, whatever you want.

842
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:28,718
What's the problem?

843
01:06:28,753 --> 01:06:30,753
Repo. Pay your bills, man.

844
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:33,855
- I'm current on my loan.
- Not my problem.

845
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:36,660
I knew you'd be behind
all this.

846
01:06:36,695 --> 01:06:38,332
Oh, let's see what we got.

847
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:41,269
He's got one of those snake
sticks in his briefcase.

848
01:06:41,304 --> 01:06:43,403
Daniel Snyder,
you're under arrest.

849
01:06:43,438 --> 01:06:45,031
You have the right
to remain silent.

850
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:46,582
Anything you do and say
can be used against you

851
01:06:46,606 --> 01:06:48,221
in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.

852
01:06:48,245 --> 01:06:50,938
- What's the charge?
- Murder.

853
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:54,612
The murders of Irene Lester,
Harlan Lester, and Betty Goss.

854
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:55,712
You got him?
Yep.

855
01:06:55,747 --> 01:06:57,186
Get him in the car.

856
01:07:16,339 --> 01:07:18,735
Ah!

857
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:22,310
<i>Theresa...</i>

858
01:07:38,196 --> 01:07:41,296
<i>Theresa...</i>

859
01:07:57,644 --> 01:08:00,645
<i>There's only one way
to mend this.</i>

860
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,267
We have your briefcase
and your little stick.

861
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:21,699
You wanna tell me...

862
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:24,097
why you have
insurance policies in it

863
01:08:24,132 --> 01:08:26,671
that expired three years ago?

864
01:08:27,344 --> 01:08:30,103
That's a crime?

865
01:08:30,138 --> 01:08:32,611
All right, let's talk turkey.

866
01:08:32,646 --> 01:08:36,043
You plead guilty...
No death penalty.

867
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:39,981
I have done nothing.
I swear it.

868
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:41,719
And I want my phone call.

869
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,534
Wow, neighbor.

870
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:56,206
World of shit, huh?

871
01:08:59,508 --> 01:09:01,222
John, there's something
serious I have to tell you.

872
01:09:01,246 --> 01:09:03,037
I don't know how to say it,
but I have to.

873
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,171
Jesus. What is it?

874
01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:06,876
Theresa and I have a past.

875
01:09:08,847 --> 01:09:10,979
I guess we all do.

876
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:14,257
What, did you kill someone?

877
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:16,589
My background is in finance.

878
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:21,231
I was approached by
a businessman with a proposal.

879
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,335
If we're smart about it,

880
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:30,735
the ROI for our investors
is above 1,000%.

881
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:32,539
We ran a Ponzi scheme
on Wall Street.

882
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:35,410
We and our investors...
We made millions.

883
01:09:35,445 --> 01:09:37,104
I didn't know what a Ponzi was.

884
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,414
I just knew that it was
beautiful, until it wasn't.

885
01:09:39,449 --> 01:09:40,877
And just like Bernie Madoff
said,

886
01:09:40,912 --> 01:09:42,780
it didn't start off
with bad intentions.

887
01:09:42,815 --> 01:09:45,519
But, as so often happens,
shit spiraled out of control.

888
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:47,422
We couldn't pay back investors.

889
01:09:47,457 --> 01:09:50,183
We were screwed.
The investors were screwed.

890
01:09:50,218 --> 01:09:51,888
My partner and I
were heading for prison.

891
01:09:51,923 --> 01:09:54,957
Theresa and I knew it.

892
01:09:54,992 --> 01:09:58,895
One day, a man showed up
at our door.

893
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,743
I don't want to go into detail
about how horrifying

894
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:03,636
this particular individual is,
but he offered me a deal.

895
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:06,067
And mutually beneficial
to the both of us.

896
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:08,135
He said I could avoid
going to jail.

897
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,105
He'd pay back all my investors
on one condition...

898
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,206
I had to do a job for him.

899
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:17,243
Do you remember telling me
the story of The Harbinger?

900
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:18,981
Y-Yeah.

901
01:10:19,016 --> 01:10:21,456
How much do you believe it?

902
01:10:21,491 --> 01:10:24,888
About as much as I believe
in Santa Claus. Why?

903
01:10:24,923 --> 01:10:27,924
This man told me
if I did this job,

904
01:10:27,959 --> 01:10:30,256
my family would never be
in financial danger again.

905
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,928
Now, the job is unspeakable.

906
01:10:31,963 --> 01:10:33,402
I couldn't bring myself
to do it,

907
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:36,097
even if it meant
avoiding poverty and prison.

908
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,264
When he realized this,

909
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:42,103
he took my daughter's spirit
until the job is done.

910
01:10:44,008 --> 01:10:46,514
Your daughter's spirit?

911
01:10:46,549 --> 01:10:49,451
What if I were to tell you
Santa Claus is real?

912
01:10:53,985 --> 01:10:58,086
You... Wh... You're telling me
there's a Harbinger?

913
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:00,660
I'll tell you everything if
you are willing to hear me out.

914
01:11:00,695 --> 01:11:03,190
Answer first. You're saying
there<i> is</i> a Harbinger.

915
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,774
I need to know
you're gonna hear me out.

916
01:11:04,798 --> 01:11:06,996
You first, or I'm walking
through that door.

917
01:11:07,031 --> 01:11:08,701
You're saying
there's a Harbinger.

918
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:11,671
No, John, I'm telling you
<i>I'm</i> The Harbinger.

919
01:11:11,706 --> 01:11:13,167
But I want out.

920
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,872
<i>My mother would never
commit suicide.</i>

921
01:11:14,907 --> 01:11:17,303
<i>She's Catholic.
Can you think of any enemies</i>

922
01:11:17,338 --> 01:11:18,986
<i>you may have made?
Found that in Betty's car.</i>

923
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,878
<i>Stabbed in the eyes
with a letter opener.</i>

924
01:11:20,913 --> 01:11:22,946
I came here to do these things.

925
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:24,684
I couldn't bring myself
to do them,

926
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,017
which means
someone<i> else</i> is doing it.

927
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:29,689
I need your help.

928
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:33,891
Uh... why am I here
and not your wife?

929
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:35,530
What does she think
about all this?

930
01:11:35,565 --> 01:11:37,477
She's part of it.
My family needs your help, John.

931
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,798
I figured<i> you</i> of all people
would believe me.

932
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:42,867
You know the story.
You have the relics!

933
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:44,506
But they're replicas.

934
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:46,673
They came with little...
Uh, little booklets.

935
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:49,203
I got 'em for a dollar each
at a yard sale.

936
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,909
I-If you told me this when
you weren't in trouble,

937
01:11:51,944 --> 01:11:53,856
I still would have thought
you were batshit crazy,

938
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,519
but, uh, now that you're sinking
without a lifeboat, mm.

939
01:11:57,554 --> 01:11:59,213
John, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

940
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,424
He says if I take enough souls,
we get Rosalie back.

941
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:03,217
But he's a con!

942
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:06,187
I-I may have another way to save
her, but I need out of here!

943
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:09,564
John! There is no one else
I can go to!

944
01:12:11,392 --> 01:12:13,227
I'm sorry, Daniel.

945
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:21,774
Ugh!

946
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:30,046
You sure you didn't make
more than one phone call?

947
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:33,379
You made bail.
Must have a guardian angel.

948
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:01,913
Hey!

949
01:13:09,824 --> 01:13:11,285
Hey!

950
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,321
I need to talk to you!

951
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:28,170
How much time do I have
before she's gone?

952
01:13:33,045 --> 01:13:35,177
Do I have any time?

953
01:14:01,007 --> 01:14:03,205
The bald man.

954
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,779
I'm ready to face him.

955
01:14:05,814 --> 01:14:08,012
I have been waiting
for this moment.

956
01:14:08,047 --> 01:14:10,113
First I have a confession
to make.

957
01:14:10,148 --> 01:14:11,851
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

958
01:14:11,886 --> 01:14:13,380
If you know what I am,

959
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:15,525
you know
I'm not the only one here.

960
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,791
I need your help.

961
01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:21,223
What are you not telling me?!

962
01:14:21,258 --> 01:14:23,830
Come and have some tea, Daniel.

963
01:14:29,706 --> 01:14:33,367
You're a tough one, Daniel.

964
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:36,040
You're still a bit...

965
01:14:36,075 --> 01:14:37,811
hidden from me.

966
01:14:37,846 --> 01:14:40,847
But your heart and your will
are here.

967
01:14:44,248 --> 01:14:46,017
Here you go.

968
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,318
And here we go.

969
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:56,027
In 1647, the first white
fur traders arrived here.

970
01:14:56,062 --> 01:14:58,667
The settlers were not
far behind.

971
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,834
They did not understand
our ways,

972
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:04,497
and we certainly
did not understand theirs.

973
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:07,940
Along with them came
their illnesses, mythology,

974
01:15:07,975 --> 01:15:11,108
their deity, and, of course,

975
01:15:11,143 --> 01:15:13,209
their anti-deity.

976
01:15:15,653 --> 01:15:18,687
But Luc, or Lucifer
as he was called then,

977
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:20,788
was new to this world as well.

978
01:15:23,628 --> 01:15:25,793
He didn't understand
that some land

979
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:29,456
was our sacred burial ground.

980
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:32,030
He had to learn the hard way.

981
01:15:32,065 --> 01:15:35,132
Because he knew he had no power
on our domain...

982
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:38,102
over time he made a promise

983
01:15:38,137 --> 01:15:41,875
to leave our people alone,

984
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:45,373
and he guaranteed it
with an official treaty ceremony

985
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:48,079
taking place with him
on his land,

986
01:15:48,114 --> 01:15:50,950
and our people on ours.

987
01:15:50,985 --> 01:15:53,821
But naturally,
he broke his promise.

988
01:15:53,856 --> 01:15:56,252
Whenever one of us
ventured off our land,

989
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,794
he took advantage.

990
01:15:59,829 --> 01:16:04,997
Through the years, Luc learned
where he had power,

991
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:07,395
where he did not.

992
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:11,168
Our people cursed him,
along with his followers

993
01:16:11,203 --> 01:16:13,742
and those who disturbed
our grounds.

994
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:18,109
From then on, Luc dared not
cross the boundary.

995
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:21,178
Although<i> he</i> learned
the lay of the land,

996
01:16:21,213 --> 01:16:23,917
the settlers did not.

997
01:16:23,952 --> 01:16:28,119
Time and time again,
and across generations,

998
01:16:28,154 --> 01:16:31,287
they buried their dead
on sacred ground.

999
01:16:31,322 --> 01:16:35,522
These souls could not be claimed
by Luc<i> or</i> God.

1000
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,964
Your people are right.

1001
01:16:37,999 --> 01:16:40,197
They<i> are</i> cursed.

1002
01:16:40,232 --> 01:16:42,771
Luc had quite the silver tongue.

1003
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,807
He promised that
if they collected enough souls,

1004
01:16:45,842 --> 01:16:48,139
he would lift the curse.

1005
01:16:48,174 --> 01:16:51,604
But no matter how many souls
The Harbingers collect,

1006
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:55,311
it is never enough.

1007
01:16:55,346 --> 01:16:57,016
He tricked 'em.

1008
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,612
And that does not bode well
for you,

1009
01:16:59,647 --> 01:17:02,054
my poor, poor, dear boy.

1010
01:17:05,257 --> 01:17:07,059
Give it to me.

1011
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:13,461
This is the dagger
made by your God.

1012
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:16,706
To resurrect her,
you must plunge the dagger

1013
01:17:16,741 --> 01:17:18,741
deep into her chest.

1014
01:17:18,776 --> 01:17:22,976
The evil will pour from her,
expelling the dagger.

1015
01:17:23,011 --> 01:17:25,407
Once her body and soul
are restored,

1016
01:17:25,442 --> 01:17:28,982
your contract with Luc
is null and void.

1017
01:17:29,017 --> 01:17:31,083
Rosalie will never go willingly.

1018
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,154
Spike her drink with this.

1019
01:17:36,189 --> 01:17:39,421
It will put her in a trance long
enough for you to get her in.

1020
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:41,555
I have something for you.

1021
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:47,330
Where did you get this?

1022
01:17:47,365 --> 01:17:51,103
This has been missing
from our people for generations,

1023
01:17:51,138 --> 01:17:52,368
centuries.

1024
01:17:52,403 --> 01:17:54,436
Valuable enough to lift
the curse?

1025
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:56,944
Daniel.
That is not for me to say,

1026
01:17:56,979 --> 01:17:59,441
It is beyond my realm
of knowledge.

1027
01:17:59,476 --> 01:18:01,377
Those curses come from
the spirits,

1028
01:18:01,412 --> 01:18:05,711
but dare I say it couldn't hurt.

1029
01:18:05,746 --> 01:18:09,187
I must give you something
in return of no less value.

1030
01:18:09,222 --> 01:18:10,793
But I have nothing.

1031
01:18:10,828 --> 01:18:12,322
Yes, you do.

1032
01:18:14,832 --> 01:18:16,766
The right half is
Native American land,

1033
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:18,394
the left half non-Native.

1034
01:18:18,429 --> 01:18:19,725
Crypt is dead center.

1035
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,210
They didn't realize when
they built that

1036
01:18:21,234 --> 01:18:23,267
that half of that
was on sacred ground, too.

1037
01:18:23,302 --> 01:18:25,148
Ironically, the one place
in the Christian world

1038
01:18:25,172 --> 01:18:27,205
he can't enter
is the house of the dead.

1039
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,405
The crypt is where
the sacrifice has to...

1040
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,275
Say no more.

1041
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:37,116
Understand this.

1042
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:38,579
The tunnels that lead
to that crypt

1043
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:41,549
were used by gangsters
during Prohibition.

1044
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,892
Their souls, among others,
still patrol.

1045
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:45,487
It won't be easy.

1046
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:47,104
But the tunnels lead
to the underground entrance.

1047
01:18:47,128 --> 01:18:50,393
If you look here, there's
an above-ground entrance.

1048
01:18:50,428 --> 01:18:51,900
We're not going
through the tunnels.

1049
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:54,265
We're going in right here.

1050
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,729
I would be shocked
if he allowed access

1051
01:18:56,764 --> 01:18:58,434
to the above-ground entrance.

1052
01:18:58,469 --> 01:19:00,469
But if you must, go in daylight.

1053
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:04,110
He will move in quickly
if he suspects you have the key.

1054
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:07,014
Otherwise, head for the tunnels.

1055
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:10,347
This pipe-shaped one...
It's called a Helix,

1056
01:19:10,382 --> 01:19:12,283
and it will keep the spirits
at bay for a bit,

1057
01:19:12,318 --> 01:19:13,856
but you don't have long.

1058
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:15,748
Get a hold of it. Oh!

1059
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:18,520
You mean this?

1060
01:19:18,555 --> 01:19:20,753
Now, you weren't 100% correct
when you said

1061
01:19:20,788 --> 01:19:22,458
that he can't enter
the house of the dead.

1062
01:19:22,493 --> 01:19:25,428
If one of his cronies
gets a hold of...

1063
01:19:25,463 --> 01:19:28,497
the globe... this one...

1064
01:19:28,532 --> 01:19:30,873
He can be summoned.

1065
01:19:30,908 --> 01:19:33,436
I wish I could do more.

1066
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:35,944
You have done plenty.

1067
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:38,111
Uh, just out of curiosity,

1068
01:19:38,146 --> 01:19:40,377
what's the story
with the one I gave you?

1069
01:19:44,812 --> 01:19:47,780
The most revered object
of our people.

1070
01:19:47,815 --> 01:19:51,058
Man and nature
working in tandem.

1071
01:19:51,093 --> 01:19:55,062
In a peace offering, it is
the highest sign of respect

1072
01:19:55,097 --> 01:19:58,461
to a former enemy
a revered object.

1073
01:19:58,496 --> 01:20:00,870
You will notice,
in his trickery,

1074
01:20:00,905 --> 01:20:03,466
he gave us a key to a crypt

1075
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:05,336
that he cannot even enter

1076
01:20:05,371 --> 01:20:07,173
and has no use to us.

1077
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:09,538
We gave him The Eagle
and The Warrior.

1078
01:20:09,573 --> 01:20:11,210
What is its power?

1079
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:14,312
Nothing.

1080
01:20:14,347 --> 01:20:16,182
And everything.

1081
01:20:21,453 --> 01:20:23,926
The time is now. You must go.

1082
01:20:23,961 --> 01:20:25,928
Go get your daughter back.

1083
01:20:30,198 --> 01:20:32,495
Daniel!
I know we can't afford it.

1084
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:34,013
Who bailed you out?
You don't want to know.

1085
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:36,334
We have to move fast.
Have Rosalie drink that.

1086
01:20:36,369 --> 01:20:37,764
What is this?

1087
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,337
Did... Did that witch
give it to you?

1088
01:20:39,372 --> 01:20:42,439
Yes, the witch,
who is, in fact, our savior.

1089
01:20:42,474 --> 01:20:44,177
Trust me.
I need a little more

1090
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:46,212
than blind faith right now.

1091
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,183
Look me in the eye.
I know how to save her.

1092
01:20:50,218 --> 01:20:51,745
But we have to do it now.

1093
01:21:12,636 --> 01:21:15,373
I forgot my ID,
went back to the station.

1094
01:21:15,408 --> 01:21:18,211
That other detective shot
himself, committed suicide.

1095
01:21:18,246 --> 01:21:21,577
And I realized you were
right there, so okay.

1096
01:21:21,612 --> 01:21:23,612
I guess there is another one.

1097
01:21:23,647 --> 01:21:25,053
Wait. What?

1098
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,813
I'm The Harbinger.

1099
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,265
You gotta put yourself
in my position.

1100
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:30,223
Imagine you're the only
Harbinger,

1101
01:21:30,258 --> 01:21:33,490
and some other schmo
tells you<i> he's</i> The Harbinger.

1102
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:35,261
But I'm not dropping
these relics, either!

1103
01:21:35,296 --> 01:21:37,890
Oh! Oof.

1104
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:39,793
The cops were scared, man.

1105
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:42,928
But, uh, I'll tell you what.

1106
01:21:42,963 --> 01:21:44,930
I believe in Santa Claus now.

1107
01:21:44,965 --> 01:21:47,009
Why would he send
two Harbingers to one town?

1108
01:21:47,044 --> 01:21:50,243
Exactly. Something reeks.

1109
01:21:50,278 --> 01:21:51,805
I want out, too.

1110
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,412
So give me the lowdown.
What's the plan?

1111
01:21:54,447 --> 01:21:55,919
Be sure Rosalie doesn't hear
any of this.

1112
01:21:55,943 --> 01:21:58,020
Have her drink it,
then bring her down.

1113
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:03,916
The sacrifice.

1114
01:22:03,951 --> 01:22:06,160
The sacrifice?

1115
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:08,756
That can only be done with
the dagger made by God Himself!

1116
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:11,924
- I have it.
- You're shittin' me.

1117
01:22:11,959 --> 01:22:14,597
Okay. Okay.
So how do I help?

1118
01:22:14,632 --> 01:22:16,599
You need your Helix
for yourself.

1119
01:22:16,634 --> 01:22:18,040
I never go anywhere without it.

1120
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:23,177
You expecting someone?

1121
01:22:23,212 --> 01:22:24,937
Shit!

1122
01:22:24,972 --> 01:22:26,052
It can't wait for daylight.

1123
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,149
I have to go now.

1124
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:31,845
Just let him in, Daniel.

1125
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,023
Just do it his way.

1126
01:22:34,058 --> 01:22:36,619
Baby, I just need you to hold
on a little bit longer for me.

1127
01:22:36,654 --> 01:22:38,291
Okay?

1128
01:22:38,326 --> 01:22:41,954
If it all ends, so be it,
but we gotta try, okay?

1129
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:43,989
You've always been stronger
than me.

1130
01:22:44,024 --> 01:22:46,629
Will you do it for Rosalie?

1131
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,837
Come on, baby. Come on.

1132
01:23:16,628 --> 01:23:18,430
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop.

1133
01:23:18,465 --> 01:23:20,025
Stop, stop, stop.

1134
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,829
Nice and easy.

1135
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:24,238
Don't call attention.

1136
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:13,155
What do we do?

1137
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:16,257
I thought he couldn't hurt us
on Indian land.

1138
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:20,591
He doesn't need to.
His presence alone stops us.

1139
01:24:20,626 --> 01:24:22,428
We have to go
through the tunnels.

1140
01:24:22,463 --> 01:24:24,166
Under different
circumstances, I'd say,

1141
01:24:24,201 --> 01:24:26,135
that's... cool.

1142
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,994
The tunnels are on
the Christian side,

1143
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,798
so have your Helix in hand.

1144
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:33,604
We're not safe until we get
inside and the door is closed.

1145
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:36,475
Just remember, slow is smooth.

1146
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:38,675
Smooth is fast.

1147
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,347
Let's move.

1148
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:14,810
So much for that. Faster.

1149
01:25:33,897 --> 01:25:35,369
This way.

1150
01:25:45,282 --> 01:25:46,908
Honey.

1151
01:25:50,749 --> 01:25:52,584
Come on, baby.

1152
01:25:52,619 --> 01:25:54,619
See you guys on the other side.

1153
01:25:56,953 --> 01:25:58,689
Let's go this, baby. Come on.

1154
01:26:07,568 --> 01:26:10,239
Oh, aah!
There's something in my shoe.

1155
01:26:10,274 --> 01:26:12,538
- Keep moving, honey.
- No. Just a second.

1156
01:26:12,969 --> 01:26:14,606
Aah! Ah!

1157
01:26:14,641 --> 01:26:16,740
Theresa.

1158
01:26:31,988 --> 01:26:34,725
Teresa, can you run?

1159
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:10,563
Where is she?

1160
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:12,334
Where is she?

1161
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,963
Where is she?

1162
01:27:14,998 --> 01:27:19,000
<i>Ahhhh. Daniel...</i>

1163
01:27:29,485 --> 01:27:30,913
Go.

1164
01:27:40,023 --> 01:27:41,858
John, keep an eye on the tunnel.

1165
01:27:43,026 --> 01:27:45,301
Teresa, shine your light
on the wall.

1166
01:27:48,636 --> 01:27:52,000
We're in the den of the devil
or on cursed Indian land.

1167
01:27:52,035 --> 01:27:53,639
Either way, we're...

1168
01:27:53,674 --> 01:27:55,168
Look for a keyhole.

1169
01:27:59,878 --> 01:28:02,142
Why did she give me this key?!

1170
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:10,551
Aah!

1171
01:29:16,757 --> 01:29:18,526
Get in. He can't enter.

1172
01:29:18,561 --> 01:29:20,022
Get in.

1173
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,505
Close!

1174
01:29:39,846 --> 01:29:41,406
Come on, baby.

1175
01:29:59,261 --> 01:30:01,668
I can't go through with it.

1176
01:30:01,703 --> 01:30:03,901
Theresa's right.
It might not work.

1177
01:30:03,936 --> 01:30:07,333
<i>Now</i> you decide that?

1178
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:09,808
It<i> won't</i> work.

1179
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,312
<i>If his cronies get a hold
of the globe,</i>

1180
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:20,819
<i>he can be summoned.</i>

1181
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:24,889
Who are you?

1182
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:39,167
He's been summoned.

1183
01:30:41,072 --> 01:30:43,270
Okay.

1184
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:45,712
All right, you win.

1185
01:30:47,342 --> 01:30:49,342
Devil's coming.

1186
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,113
There's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

1187
01:30:51,148 --> 01:30:52,148
You guys win.

1188
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,140
Aaah!

1189
01:31:21,783 --> 01:31:24,652
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

1190
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:26,346
Ah!

1191
01:31:33,025 --> 01:31:34,222
Daniel, look out!

1192
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:38,699
Aaaaah!

1193
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:43,836
Aah! Aaaaaah!

1194
01:32:00,316 --> 01:32:02,591
Aah!

1195
01:32:02,626 --> 01:32:04,593
Aaaaaaaah!

1196
01:32:04,628 --> 01:32:07,057
Aaah!

1197
01:32:28,014 --> 01:32:30,443
Before I kill you, John,
you should know I'm never

1198
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,478
gonna stop till these souls
are free.

1199
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:35,547
Your sweetheart boss can't touch
this town anymore.

1200
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:48,065
He'll be here any moment.

1201
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,299
Tell him yourself.

1202
01:32:59,342 --> 01:33:01,507
Where's the dagger?

1203
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:03,212
Where's the dagger?!

1204
01:33:06,184 --> 01:33:07,854
What do I do now?

1205
01:33:07,889 --> 01:33:11,451
It's pointless to worry
about what you can't control.

1206
01:33:11,486 --> 01:33:14,696
It is not safe for him to enter.

1207
01:33:14,731 --> 01:33:18,832
We are forbidden to interfere
with any contract

1208
01:33:18,867 --> 01:33:21,131
someone has with him.

1209
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:24,035
No talking to, no touching,
no helping Harbingers,

1210
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:27,335
lest we ourselves
risk damnation.

1211
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:30,679
I almost gave in to temptation

1212
01:33:30,714 --> 01:33:33,308
when you reached
to open your door to me,

1213
01:33:33,343 --> 01:33:36,509
but thankfully regained
my resolve.

1214
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:38,852
Now...

1215
01:33:38,887 --> 01:33:41,514
it is too late.

1216
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:44,055
What are you?

1217
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:46,024
Emissary.

1218
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:49,291
Harbinger Protector.

1219
01:33:49,326 --> 01:33:50,930
And Angel.

1220
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:55,198
Is there a way I can help you?

1221
01:33:55,233 --> 01:33:57,068
No.

1222
01:33:57,103 --> 01:33:59,741
He hit me with the dagger.

1223
01:33:59,776 --> 01:34:01,468
The dagger hit me, too.

1224
01:34:01,503 --> 01:34:03,844
You can live.

1225
01:34:03,879 --> 01:34:06,638
If the dagger pierces
my kind, our earthly form

1226
01:34:06,673 --> 01:34:09,575
in this world is...

1227
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,049
over.

1228
01:34:11,084 --> 01:34:14,723
We need your help.
Are there more of you?

1229
01:34:14,758 --> 01:34:17,583
I was all you had.

1230
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:20,960
Only so many soldiers
to go around.

1231
01:34:24,559 --> 01:34:29,595
God... be... with...

1232
01:34:56,756 --> 01:34:59,130
Whatever happens, Daniel,

1233
01:34:59,165 --> 01:35:00,802
do not let go of this thing.

1234
01:35:00,837 --> 01:35:03,629
He left it for a reason.

1235
01:35:26,588 --> 01:35:29,259
Mm-hmm.

1236
01:35:39,172 --> 01:35:40,699
Theresa!

1237
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:44,637
How's the family?

1238
01:35:45,112 --> 01:35:49,851
Oh, Daniel, you perplex me.

1239
01:35:49,886 --> 01:35:52,854
How is it you can be so lost

1240
01:35:52,889 --> 01:35:55,747
in a world of lost souls?

1241
01:35:55,782 --> 01:35:57,826
I would think
you'd fit right in.

1242
01:35:59,357 --> 01:36:01,357
Daniel, I want to show you
something.

1243
01:36:01,392 --> 01:36:03,623
What do you say we pop up
and get a breath of fresh air?

1244
01:36:03,658 --> 01:36:07,132
You can't possibly think
I'm that stupid.

1245
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:10,938
Well, look at you.

1246
01:36:10,973 --> 01:36:13,369
What I want to show you
can't be seen down here.

1247
01:36:13,404 --> 01:36:14,700
It's a surprise.

1248
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:16,603
It's educational.

1249
01:36:16,638 --> 01:36:18,440
And to be fair,
it's... it's safe.

1250
01:36:18,475 --> 01:36:20,607
Whatever you can show me
up there,

1251
01:36:20,642 --> 01:36:22,312
you can show me right here.

1252
01:36:24,844 --> 01:36:27,053
I was gonna give you
a chance to save your daughter,

1253
01:36:27,088 --> 01:36:28,714
but never mind, you blew it.

1254
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:31,354
I could have caught you
in the cemetery.

1255
01:36:31,389 --> 01:36:34,654
I could have
killed you in your bed.

1256
01:36:34,689 --> 01:36:36,865
But then we'd be missing out
on all this fun!

1257
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,559
Save it!

1258
01:36:38,594 --> 01:36:40,902
We both know killing me
won't get you what you want.

1259
01:36:40,937 --> 01:36:43,069
So you've been running off

1260
01:36:43,104 --> 01:36:46,402
to see your new girlfriend
on the Indian land.

1261
01:36:46,437 --> 01:36:51,473
Did that old hag make mention
of you being blocked?

1262
01:36:51,508 --> 01:36:54,916
Not being able
to fully read you?

1263
01:36:54,951 --> 01:36:57,215
Well, since she<i> failed,</i>

1264
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,987
let me unblock you.

1265
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:14,067
I can only erase the memories
of a past life so many times

1266
01:37:14,102 --> 01:37:18,764
before you start losing
the faith earlier in each one,

1267
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:22,669
sooner and sooner,
to the point where

1268
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:24,869
you're just a couple
of bad apples.

1269
01:37:24,904 --> 01:37:29,313
You just become worthless.

1270
01:37:31,317 --> 01:37:33,581
In your first lifetime,

1271
01:37:33,616 --> 01:37:39,455
you were dropping relics
like fliessssss

1272
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:41,391
It made me want
to keep bringing it back.

1273
01:37:41,426 --> 01:37:44,724
You fell off a bit
in your next couple.

1274
01:37:44,759 --> 01:37:46,968
I kept having to bait you with,

1275
01:37:47,003 --> 01:37:50,466
"I'll reverse the Indian curse!"

1276
01:37:50,501 --> 01:37:53,733
You were actually an easy one.

1277
01:37:53,768 --> 01:37:58,947
I'd wager you'd do anything
to remove your curse.

1278
01:37:58,982 --> 01:38:02,808
But your last lifetime,
it was embarrassing.

1279
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:07,813
And this one...
What kind of a Harbinger

1280
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:09,991
only drops one relic?

1281
01:38:10,026 --> 01:38:12,653
And you could only bring
yourself to do it that one time

1282
01:38:12,688 --> 01:38:15,260
because he was the one who roped
you into the Ponzi scheme

1283
01:38:15,295 --> 01:38:16,657
in the first place.

1284
01:38:16,692 --> 01:38:20,133
And he used his wife
as a punching bag.

1285
01:38:20,168 --> 01:38:23,565
<i>You</i> are the worst Harbinger
I've ever had.

1286
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,238
Sell her the insurance.

1287
01:38:26,273 --> 01:38:27,987
And even when I took
your daughter's soul,

1288
01:38:28,011 --> 01:38:31,243
you couldn't
bring yourself to do it.

1289
01:38:31,278 --> 01:38:34,807
You serve no purpose for me.

1290
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:37,612
So let me show you
what I've done.

1291
01:39:14,222 --> 01:39:16,552
You see, I knew a long time ago

1292
01:39:16,587 --> 01:39:18,554
that you were
no longer effective.

1293
01:39:18,589 --> 01:39:20,358
But what you didn't count on

1294
01:39:20,393 --> 01:39:23,724
is that this isn't just a town
where Harbingers are sent.

1295
01:39:23,759 --> 01:39:26,397
You weren't brought here
to doom anyone.

1296
01:39:26,432 --> 01:39:30,401
This is a town of ex-Harbingers.

1297
01:39:30,436 --> 01:39:33,074
They're already doomed.

1298
01:39:33,109 --> 01:39:34,834
This is a town

1299
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:40,378
where Harbingers are sent
to be, uh, retired.

1300
01:39:40,413 --> 01:39:41,841
Not getting it?

1301
01:39:41,876 --> 01:39:44,646
Need me to spell it out for you?

1302
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:48,980
This is one big theater show

1303
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:51,521
to get you to kill yourselves,

1304
01:39:51,556 --> 01:39:57,098
to harass you enough
to get you... retired.

1305
01:39:57,133 --> 01:40:01,828
And you can't save them either.
They're already dead.

1306
01:40:01,863 --> 01:40:03,566
Like your daughter.

1307
01:40:03,601 --> 01:40:06,998
St. Heraldson is literally

1308
01:40:07,033 --> 01:40:09,836
Hell on Earth.

1309
01:40:09,871 --> 01:40:12,245
Now do you want
to see what's up there?

1310
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,576
Well, too bad!

1311
01:40:13,611 --> 01:40:15,050
There's only one way
out of this crypt

1312
01:40:15,074 --> 01:40:17,514
for the Snyders now,
and that's down.

1313
01:40:17,549 --> 01:40:19,549
Down! You had your chance.

1314
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,189
You had your chance!
<i>Buenos noches. Arrivederci.</i>

1315
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:24,125
<i>Adieu! Buenos noches!</i>

1316
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,919
Good night.
Good night!

1317
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:37,963
Ah. Hmm.

1318
01:40:41,177 --> 01:40:43,243
I see you've had a visitor.

1319
01:40:56,423 --> 01:40:58,357
Aah!

1320
01:41:00,757 --> 01:41:04,231
Aah!

1321
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:07,630
Ow!

1322
01:41:07,665 --> 01:41:10,237
Aaaah!

1323
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:13,141
The wrong side of the crypt.

1324
01:41:13,176 --> 01:41:14,802
You can't defeat me.

1325
01:41:22,977 --> 01:41:25,109
Aaaaaah!

1326
01:41:54,844 --> 01:41:57,383
- Ah!
- No!

1327
01:41:57,418 --> 01:41:59,550
Don't hurt him!

1328
01:41:59,585 --> 01:42:02,223
Aah! Aah!

1329
01:42:08,495 --> 01:42:10,528
<i>Do you remember your daughter?</i>

1330
01:42:18,835 --> 01:42:20,736
No!

1331
01:42:36,391 --> 01:42:41,053
Now you've just pissed me off.

1332
01:42:41,088 --> 01:42:43,528
I gave you the chance
to save your daughter

1333
01:42:43,563 --> 01:42:45,057
if you did my bidding.

1334
01:42:45,092 --> 01:42:47,697
You failed me!

1335
01:42:47,732 --> 01:42:51,338
Then you reject
my generous offer tonight.

1336
01:42:51,373 --> 01:42:53,934
You insulted me!

1337
01:42:57,577 --> 01:42:59,445
I revoke my offer.

1338
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:01,612
I condemn you
to an eternity of servitude,

1339
01:43:01,647 --> 01:43:04,780
and your daughter's soul
is lost forever.

1340
01:43:07,081 --> 01:43:10,390
<i>Sin-bay R'el-bay</i>

1341
01:43:10,425 --> 01:43:14,086
<i>Ei-ou-ah-bum E-Noh</i>

1342
01:43:14,121 --> 01:43:19,564
<i>Kay-shal Fee-loch-Nebeum!</i>

1343
01:43:19,599 --> 01:43:24,701
<i>That's</i> your only option now.

1344
01:43:24,736 --> 01:43:26,868
See you in Hell.

1345
01:43:30,445 --> 01:43:35,547
<i>Only death can save her.
Only death can set her free.</i>

1346
01:43:42,325 --> 01:43:44,325
Me for her.

1347
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,954
Why should I bargain?

1348
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:49,330
I have your soul already.

1349
01:43:49,365 --> 01:43:53,631
If you win my soul,
you have me forever.

1350
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:55,303
Ooh.

1351
01:43:57,835 --> 01:43:59,901
Done.

1352
01:43:59,936 --> 01:44:01,474
Daniel!

1353
01:44:03,478 --> 01:44:05,104
I love you, baby.

1354
01:44:07,977 --> 01:44:10,318
Goodbye, my sweet baby girl.

1355
01:44:42,649 --> 01:44:44,781
Ah.

1356
01:45:18,454 --> 01:45:20,080
Mommy?

1357
01:45:21,589 --> 01:45:23,215
Ah.

1358
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:26,988
Ah! Ah!

1359
01:45:29,729 --> 01:45:31,762
Hi, baby.

1360
01:45:31,797 --> 01:45:36,437
Oh, baby! Oh!

1361
01:45:36,472 --> 01:45:40,199
No, no, no. No, come on.

1362
01:45:43,138 --> 01:45:45,336

What?

01:47:12,227 --> 01:47:13,864
What is that?

1377
01:47:16,462 --> 01:47:20,508
If the Card of Death
is present during his curse,

1378
01:47:20,543 --> 01:47:22,543
the souls are restored.

1379
01:47:23,810 --> 01:47:25,480
Where did you get it?

1380
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:29,209
Him.

1381
01:47:31,477 --> 01:47:33,950
Told me where to find
the dagger, too.

1382
01:48:03,718 --> 01:48:06,246
Good for you.

1383
01:48:06,281 --> 01:48:09,381
I love a challenge.

1384
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:11,922
Yessssss!

1385
01:48:11,957 --> 01:48:16,960
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

1386
01:48:19,294 --> 01:48:22,933
You and Rosalie have suffered
because of my choices.

1387
01:48:22,968 --> 01:48:24,836
I'm sorry, Theresa.

1388
01:48:24,871 --> 01:48:26,838
Thank you for sticking with me.

1389
01:48:32,307 --> 01:48:35,539
We have the knowledge
and the tools now.

1390
01:48:35,574 --> 01:48:37,750
This town, others out there...

1391
01:48:37,785 --> 01:48:41,116
We could help them, Theresa.

1392
01:48:41,151 --> 01:48:44,152
How many of those Harbinger
Protectors are out there?

1393
01:48:45,661 --> 01:48:47,892
Time to find out.

1394
01:48:56,672 --> 01:49:00,201
<i>In every lifetime,
he has tested me</i>

1395
01:49:00,236 --> 01:49:01,906
<i>and I've failed.</i>

1396
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:05,943
<i>For whatever reason,</i>

1397
01:49:05,978 --> 01:49:09,947
<i>I've been given a second chance
in this lifetime.</i>

1398
01:49:09,982 --> 01:49:13,951
<i>How many other Rosalies
out there can I save?</i>

1399
01:49:13,986 --> 01:49:17,317
<i>How many others
are forced to be...</i>

1400
01:49:17,352 --> 01:49:19,055
<i>The Harbinger?</i>
