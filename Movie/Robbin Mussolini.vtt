MILAN 1945

00:29.208 --> 00:32.917
LAST DAYS OF WAR

00:37.667 --> 00:39.625
THIS IS TRUE HISTORY.

00:39.708 --> 00:43.083
THIS STORY IS TRUE-ISH.

00:57.667 --> 00:58.667
Get out!

00:59.792 --> 01:01.625
Out! Come on!

01:01.708 --> 01:03.208
One second. This is our stuff!

01:05.583 --> 01:07.208
-Mommy!
-Wait!

01:43.083 --> 01:47.292
WHISPERS OF MEMORY

02:01.000 --> 02:02.833
Did anyone follow you?

02:03.833 --> 02:05.125
I'm a professional.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.958
Since you're a professional,
make your own appointments next time.

02:09.042 --> 02:11.042
-I'm not your secretary.
-The partisans?

02:11.625 --> 02:13.333
They're still on for tonight.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.083
What's with that face? Huh?

02:17.167 --> 02:18.333
It's dangerous.

02:18.417 --> 02:20.500
You're risking too much. For what?

02:20.583 --> 02:21.417
For what?

02:21.500 --> 02:22.542
For you.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.333
For us.

02:25.208 --> 02:28.042
I'll soon have enough money
for us to be able to go away.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.500
Far from Borsalino and his boss.

02:31.708 --> 02:32.792
<i>Hail to il Duce!</i>

02:33.833 --> 02:34.833
Do you trust me?

02:37.042 --> 02:38.583
<i>Fighters…</i>

02:40.333 --> 02:41.167
I trust you.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.250
<i>…of land,</i>

02:43.292 --> 02:44.375
<i>sea…</i>

02:44.458 --> 02:45.417
I'm going.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.792
It's late.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.458
<i>Listen.</i>

02:48.958 --> 02:51.083
-I'll come by the Cabiria later.
-No.

02:51.167 --> 02:54.542
-If Borsalino sees you, you'll hang.
-I'm a pro, I told you.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.792
<i>There is only one order.</i>

02:58.708 --> 02:59.917
<i>Conquer!</i>

03:01.208 --> 03:04.708
<i>-Duce!</i>
<i>-Duce!</i>

03:30.292 --> 03:31.333
Happy?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.333
-The rest?
-Come.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.583
-Why do they call you Isola?
-'Cause I work alone.

03:39.667 --> 03:43.208
I know you're one of the few left
running the city's illegal market.

03:43.292 --> 03:44.125
The only one.

03:46.083 --> 03:49.625
It's a miracle that the fascists
haven't shut you down yet.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.375
I'm a thief, not a spy.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.708
Spies don't make enough money.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.917
We could really do with someone like you.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.542
-Yeah?
-And you could do with some friends.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.958
A hundred kilos of TNT.

04:07.042 --> 04:09.833
Five Stens, four Berettas,
four Mausers, and two Lugers.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.583
And two boxes of ammunition.

04:15.042 --> 04:16.792
I officially confiscate these weapons

04:16.875 --> 04:19.542
on behalf of the resistance
and the Italian people.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.667
Don't take it personally.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.625
We're making history.

04:23.708 --> 04:25.625
No one's smarter than history.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.042
Not even you.

04:28.458 --> 04:29.333
As you wish.

04:29.417 --> 04:30.583
What the fuck you doing?

04:36.417 --> 04:37.667
You said you work alone.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.375
I need some friends. You said it yourself.

04:55.917 --> 04:56.917
Easy does it.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.042
-Not gonna count it?
-I trust you.

05:05.792 --> 05:06.958
Someone's coming.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.333
Fascists! Take cover!

05:10.083 --> 05:11.083
Go!

05:11.750 --> 05:12.625
No!

05:12.708 --> 05:14.583
-They're coming, Let's go!
-Watch out!

05:15.750 --> 05:17.000
Shit!

05:17.083 --> 05:17.958
Fire!

05:35.417 --> 05:37.667
Death to the fascists!

05:47.833 --> 05:49.792
No!

06:01.500 --> 06:02.750
Go!

06:02.833 --> 06:05.583
-Fuck! The money!
-Does this seem like the time?

06:05.667 --> 06:07.167
Stay down! Down!

06:08.333 --> 06:13.208
Stay down!

07:55.292 --> 07:57.833
CABIRIA THEATER

08:05.958 --> 08:08.208
-See you later.
-"I'm sorry, Marcello."

08:08.292 --> 08:10.667
"I lost the money, Marcello.
You saved my life."

08:10.750 --> 08:13.250
Hey! Don't you start as well.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.458
-Isola!
-What?

08:14.542 --> 08:16.875
I don't wanna get hanged for a quickie.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.167
I'm not making any promises.

08:39.417 --> 08:40.292
Yvonne?

08:42.542 --> 08:43.917
Don't call me "Yvonne."

08:45.125 --> 08:46.250
Not you as well.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.333
So, how did it go?

08:54.792 --> 08:55.667
It went well.

08:56.625 --> 08:57.458
A kiss?

09:03.667 --> 09:04.500
Pietro.

09:04.583 --> 09:05.875
-No, Pietro.
-Listen.

09:06.750 --> 09:07.667
Pietro.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.375
Open this.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.250
-Listen.
-Keep it down.

09:16.833 --> 09:19.042
-Miss Yvonne?
-Christ!

09:20.833 --> 09:21.667
Miss Yvonne?

09:22.625 --> 09:23.875
Just a sec.

09:30.167 --> 09:31.500
I was getting changed.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.708
Get a move on!

09:49.792 --> 09:51.458
Borsalino's waiting for you.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.542
<i>Did you know, Professor,</i>

10:13.625 --> 10:18.458
<i>a scorching iron in the liver causes</i>
<i>excruciating pain without being lethal?</i>

10:18.542 --> 10:20.167
At least not straight away.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.583
The heat instantly cauterizes the wound

10:24.167 --> 10:27.292
without any internal
or external hemorrhaging.

10:28.458 --> 10:32.000
Some have survived for three days
without ever passing out.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.833
A minimal knowledge of anatomy

10:35.417 --> 10:39.083
and a little practice
is all it takes to find the right spots.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.500
Who helped you print your Soviet booklets?

11:20.667 --> 11:23.417
Secretary Borsalino, she's here.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.417
We'll continue tomorrow, then.

12:12.083 --> 12:15.417
NAME: EDOARDO
SURNAME: SCARANTINO

12:23.500 --> 12:24.750
How are you doing?

12:24.833 --> 12:26.000
Nearly there.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.792
Any new comics from the Americans?

12:30.333 --> 12:33.042
-Only this.
-The<i> Corriere dei Piccoli.</i>

12:33.125 --> 12:34.833
Why? You aren't small?

12:34.917 --> 12:36.875
That's crazy. He's complaining.

12:36.958 --> 12:38.333
What's up with him?

12:38.417 --> 12:40.417
Yvonne must've turned him down.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.458
<i>Hello?</i>

13:05.333 --> 13:06.167
Achille.

13:06.708 --> 13:08.833
I can't sleep without you.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.958
<i>I'm busy at the prefecture.</i>
<i>Take your sedative and go to bed.</i>

13:13.042 --> 13:14.208
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

13:14.292 --> 13:16.500
You aren't done with your whore yet?

13:17.542 --> 13:18.625
Good night, Nora.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.750
THE END

14:36.083 --> 14:36.958
Good night.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.042
Wait.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.208
Maybe you can figure this out.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.292
Another load of weapons?

14:44.792 --> 14:47.833
It's not like the other communications.
It's coded.

14:49.750 --> 14:50.792
Try and take a look.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.208
Good night, Marcello.

14:54.292 --> 14:55.208
Good night.

15:02.042 --> 15:05.375
<i>Hey, Pietro. We don't even have</i>
<i>a lira left for food, huh?</i>

15:05.458 --> 15:07.417
<i>Thanks for the press release, Marcello.</i>

15:10.042 --> 15:11.250
Go call Amedeo.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.458
Amedeo.

15:14.708 --> 15:15.667
Amedeo!

15:17.083 --> 15:18.583
-Food's ready.
-Coming.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.792
What are you doing?

15:19.875 --> 15:22.250
Marcello asked me to work on something.

15:24.583 --> 15:25.417
Pretty!

15:26.000 --> 15:28.333
Haven't you done anything with her yet?

15:29.875 --> 15:32.583
Sorry about last night.
I've been kind of an asshole.

15:33.208 --> 15:34.708
I'm used to it.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.917
We aren't just a team, you know?

15:39.917 --> 15:40.958
We're a family.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.667
Me, you, Marcello.

15:44.542 --> 15:45.500
Right?

15:47.208 --> 15:48.125
Come on.

15:49.708 --> 15:50.542
Isola?

15:52.333 --> 15:53.250
Thanks.

16:01.583 --> 16:02.833
<i>Corriere dei Piccoli.</i>

16:06.625 --> 16:08.000
<i>Corriere dei Piccoli!</i>

16:08.875 --> 16:10.792
<i>"C-D-P." Corriere dei Piccoli.</i>

16:13.292 --> 16:15.042
"P6," page six!

16:17.167 --> 16:18.000
Forty-nine.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.250
Three, four, five…

16:20.375 --> 16:22.167
"Bring soon."

16:24.667 --> 16:25.708
Twenty-seven.

16:27.625 --> 16:28.500
"The gold"?

16:30.208 --> 16:31.833
Gold. I don't believe it.

16:32.583 --> 16:33.625
I did it!

16:35.458 --> 16:37.625
I did it!

16:39.542 --> 16:41.750
I did it!

16:49.208 --> 16:50.250
So?

16:53.167 --> 16:54.042
Marcello…

16:54.750 --> 16:58.792
Last night he intercepted
a coded message from the prefecture.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.917
-And?
-They have an escape plan.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.208
-They want to escape.
-Who?

17:03.292 --> 17:04.542
Mussolini.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.625
Mussolini and all the leaders
of the Republic of Salò.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.250
With 20 years of stolen Italian gold.

17:14.958 --> 17:17.917
Can you imagine?
All of Italy's treasure in our hands.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.167
It's in the Black Zone for now.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.417
-They'll take everything to Switzerland.
-You're mad. What the fuck?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.208
You can't approach the Black Zone!

17:27.292 --> 17:29.667
-We'll find a way.
-They shoot on sight.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.167
Not even a leaf falls
without Borsalino knowing.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.792
-That's why you're there.
-No!

17:33.875 --> 17:35.792
If you haven't noticed,
we're still at war.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.583
Exactly. Who would do
something this crazy while at war?

17:38.667 --> 17:40.167
-You.
-Us.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.333
This is our chance, Yvonne.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.000
The one we've been waiting for.

17:52.542 --> 17:53.917
How can't you see that?

17:56.625 --> 17:58.208
I'm sorry, little head.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.083
It's practically--
Impossible.

18:02.167 --> 18:04.000
What are we talking about?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.042
The Black Zone is
the most surveilled place in Italy.

18:09.208 --> 18:12.958
The whole military command is in there.
It's a mousetrap.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.625
Hundreds of fascists ready to fire.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.542
Armed guards on every corner.

18:18.125 --> 18:20.375
Turrets with machine guns. Great!

18:24.625 --> 18:26.750
The warehouse where they store the loot.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.125
Let me see.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.417
-What's that?
-What?

18:33.500 --> 18:34.375
Over there.

18:36.375 --> 18:37.792
The Torre delle Sirene.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.500
That's where the alarms sound
for the whole city in case of bombing.

18:42.583 --> 18:43.792
No.

18:43.875 --> 18:46.292
I told you, Isola. Impossible.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.458
-Stop being an asshole.
-Can I see?

18:48.542 --> 18:50.958
It's not difficult. We need to think.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.667
You need to think!

18:52.750 --> 18:55.750
So, once we're in,
provided that we get in,

18:55.833 --> 18:58.333
what do we say?
"Here for the goods. Sign, please"?

18:58.417 --> 19:01.167
We just need a plan. And more men.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.083
How much time?

19:03.167 --> 19:04.708
-Seven days.
-Seven days?!

19:06.750 --> 19:07.833
Fuck you.

19:07.917 --> 19:09.750
Thanks for the show. Can we go?

19:09.833 --> 19:11.625
I'm too old for this bullshit.

19:21.167 --> 19:24.000
Isola!

19:24.083 --> 19:25.375
We have to go!

19:26.917 --> 19:29.583
-The rifle. Isola, let's go!
-Hurry up, Isola!

19:33.958 --> 19:35.667
I know how to do it!

19:51.917 --> 19:53.000
It's still crazy.

19:53.625 --> 19:54.667
It's a plan.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.250
It could work.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.250
It will work.

19:57.833 --> 20:00.167
-We only need three men.
-Three specialists.

20:00.250 --> 20:03.333
Yes. A driver,
a bomb guy, and a featherweight.

20:03.417 --> 20:05.333
I might have someone for the explosives.

20:05.417 --> 20:07.750
-Do I know him?
-We haven't spoken in ages.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.208
Is he trustworthy?

20:09.292 --> 20:10.458
<i>He's the best.</i>

20:14.333 --> 20:16.458
Good. Only two left. Suggestions?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.000
Do they have to be men?

20:19.083 --> 20:20.958
Got anyone specific in mind?

20:21.583 --> 20:22.417
<i>Her again?</i>

20:22.500 --> 20:25.125
Get back here! Stop her!

20:39.500 --> 20:40.792
Halt!

20:43.667 --> 20:45.042
Stop! Hands up!

20:57.333 --> 20:58.708
Got a minute for me?

21:00.667 --> 21:02.792
-The driver?
-Fabbri could do it.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.208
-Fabbri?
-Not Fabbri.

21:04.292 --> 21:06.083
-Yes, Fabbri.
-No. You know why.

21:06.167 --> 21:08.375
Giovanni Fabbri,
the Mille Miglia champion?

21:08.458 --> 21:10.708
<i>The hero of the Nürburgring? That Fabbri?</i>

21:12.750 --> 21:14.333
<i>Know any others, Amedeo?</i>

21:17.000 --> 21:18.292
Isn't he dead?

21:18.375 --> 21:19.500
He's undercover.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.958
<i>Fabbri isn't trustworthy.</i>

21:33.042 --> 21:35.292
<i>He is! He found God</i>
<i>and became trustworthy.</i>

21:35.375 --> 21:36.292
He's cleaned up.

21:41.417 --> 21:42.833
Got the stuff?

21:42.917 --> 21:44.125
Guess.

21:48.417 --> 21:49.708
Take that as a "yes."

21:50.625 --> 21:53.042
Listen, Giovanni, you're a draft dodger

21:53.125 --> 21:54.833
hiding in his uncle's monastery.

21:54.917 --> 21:58.250
I'm the nation's hero in Nürburgring,
if you don't mind.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.583
Technically, if they find you,
they'll shoot you.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.750
All right. What are we stealing?

22:03.583 --> 22:04.833
We're robbing il Duce.

22:23.458 --> 22:26.875
A fascist lawyer worked here.
This was his office.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.500
Do I need a tetanus booster?

22:31.583 --> 22:34.083
Fabbri, come on.
You don't have to move in.

22:39.292 --> 22:40.958
It's an emergency shelter.

22:41.042 --> 22:43.000
Was the cleaner fired?

22:46.958 --> 22:48.792
Where's your explosives expert?

22:49.833 --> 22:51.000
We have a problem.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.750
Sons of bitches.

23:12.125 --> 23:12.958
Shit!

23:45.417 --> 23:49.500
I do not fear the unknown
as long as my soul doesn't betray me!

23:58.625 --> 24:01.333
You still have time, my child. Repent.

24:02.708 --> 24:03.875
Who are you?

24:03.958 --> 24:05.750
A friend of Marcello Davoli.

24:07.167 --> 24:08.250
Pirates!

24:09.042 --> 24:11.708
Criminals! Cowards!

24:14.167 --> 24:15.667
Long live anarchy!

24:25.083 --> 24:27.375
The condemned refuses the sacraments.

24:30.500 --> 24:34.333
<i>Goodbye Lugano Bella</i>

24:34.417 --> 24:37.792
<i>Oh sweet pious land</i>

24:47.583 --> 24:50.042
Fire! Fire, for Christ's sake!

25:18.958 --> 25:22.167
<i>The anarchists go away</i>

25:22.250 --> 25:25.583
<i>But you speak of us</i>

25:25.667 --> 25:28.500
<i>With a vile lie…</i>

25:53.583 --> 25:55.542
-Want some?
-No.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.667
Look who's coming.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.875
-Pietro.
-He prefers Isola.

26:04.958 --> 26:07.208
"Isola." Is that a stage name?

26:08.208 --> 26:09.542
-You're Molotov?
-Yes.

26:10.667 --> 26:11.708
Is yours a stage name?

26:11.792 --> 26:13.917
Mine's a nom de guerre. It's different.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.083
Oh, yeah?

26:15.167 --> 26:17.542
You were this tall
the last time I saw you.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.167
You knew my father.

26:20.250 --> 26:23.542
Michele? Are you kidding?
The three of us were like brothers.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.000
You were in Fiume too?

26:30.417 --> 26:33.042
We were ready to die.
We all believed in something then.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.833
Me, your father, even him.

26:34.917 --> 26:36.833
Yes. I almost lost my leg.

26:38.292 --> 26:39.792
And I lost a friend.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.958
If you want to survive,
better to be a thief than a hero.

26:45.875 --> 26:46.750
Let's start.

26:48.417 --> 26:49.417
This is the plan.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.833
EXPLOSIVES
GATE, SHELTER, TOWER

26:50.917 --> 26:54.083
Everyone will have their part,
so listen up and don't piss me off.

26:54.625 --> 26:56.583
We have less than five days left.

26:56.667 --> 26:57.750
DEATH TO BANDITS

26:57.833 --> 26:59.208
To enter the Black Zone,

27:00.417 --> 27:02.708
we need permits, certified by Salò.

27:02.792 --> 27:05.667
Hessa will procure one,
and Amedeo will make some fakes.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.708
And the RSI's stamp?
I don't have molds for that.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.042
The original is only in--

27:10.125 --> 27:13.750
Obviously, I already have someone
who can steal one.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.000
<i>-And she agreed?</i>
<i>-Yvonne trusts me.</i>

27:20.042 --> 27:21.583
We'll get a military truck.

27:22.333 --> 27:26.292
<i>The kind the fascists use</i>
<i>to transport soldiers or prisoners.</i>

27:28.333 --> 27:29.292
Fabbri drives.

27:29.792 --> 27:32.958
<i>Molotov and I will be in the back</i>
<i>wearing official uniforms.</i>

27:33.042 --> 27:35.500
<i>Everyone else will be under the bench.</i>

27:35.583 --> 27:38.583
Once inside,
how do we deal with the guards?

27:39.208 --> 27:42.333
<i>We lure them into the bunker</i>
<i>and lock them in.</i>

27:42.417 --> 27:43.708
How do we do that?

27:44.583 --> 27:46.042
With a magic trick?

27:46.125 --> 27:47.167
Almost.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.208
<i>We'll simulate an American air raid.</i>

27:50.833 --> 27:54.000
<i>Those pieces of shit will</i>
<i>barricade themselves in like maggots.</i>

27:54.083 --> 27:55.583
<i>We need you for that.</i>

27:56.333 --> 27:58.625
<i>You'll climb up here,</i>
<i>the Torre delle Sirene,</i>

27:58.708 --> 28:01.375
<i>the control center</i>
<i>for all the city's alarms.</i>

28:07.875 --> 28:08.792
<i>That's it?</i>

28:08.875 --> 28:11.333
Who'll ensure the guards
go in the shelter?

28:11.417 --> 28:13.417
We'll give them a little incentive.

28:15.208 --> 28:16.750
<i>Molotov and Amedeo.</i>

28:18.125 --> 28:21.208
<i>They'll place the explosives</i>
<i>all along the perimeter.</i>

28:23.042 --> 28:24.875
<i>When they explode, it'll be hell.</i>

28:28.000 --> 28:30.042
<i>We'll have plenty of time</i>
<i>to steal the gold.</i>

28:31.875 --> 28:33.000
<i>And the war is won.</i>

28:33.500 --> 28:34.792
Hang on.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.458
Give me the paper, please.

28:39.583 --> 28:41.958
Is this ugly scrawl supposed to be me?

28:42.042 --> 28:43.583
Fabbri, don't be a pain.

28:43.667 --> 28:46.708
You do realize
that I won a medal in Monte Carlo?

28:46.792 --> 28:49.708
-That I'm the hero--
-Of the Nürburgring. We know.

28:49.792 --> 28:52.375
Awarded by il Duce himself, by the way.

28:52.458 --> 28:55.833
Say what you like about Benito,
but he knows his cars.

28:55.917 --> 28:57.750
-Well, in that case--
-Enough!

29:01.958 --> 29:03.958
What you hear out there isn't war.

29:05.833 --> 29:06.833
It's history.

29:09.125 --> 29:11.875
And history always screws us over.
You know why?

29:11.958 --> 29:15.875
Because when people look at us,
they see petty crooks. That's what.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.083
Nobodies.

29:18.667 --> 29:19.708
Thanks, boss.

29:21.917 --> 29:23.042
Not me, Fabbri.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.583
I see pros.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.083
Virtuous people.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.792
And this is your chance to prove it.

29:33.083 --> 29:37.708
And to take back, with some interest,
everything they stole from us.

29:39.667 --> 29:42.167
Someone told me
that nobody can outsmart history.

29:43.958 --> 29:45.333
Maybe he was right.

29:45.833 --> 29:47.042
Maybe not.

29:47.708 --> 29:49.917
But we'll never know if we don't try.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.000
Fuck history.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.917
That's all fine and dandy,
but how do I prepare the explosives?

30:04.625 --> 30:07.958
What you have in mind
needs at least 100 kg of TNT.

30:08.042 --> 30:11.500
Stealing from the fascists is impossible.
The Americans won't give us shit.

30:12.875 --> 30:15.792
We need to retrieve
the last batch I sold to Ahab.

30:16.292 --> 30:18.583
<i>The load is in a villa in Brianza.</i>

30:18.667 --> 30:20.875
The owner's a friend of the resistance.

30:21.458 --> 30:22.333
Great.

30:22.417 --> 30:24.000
Who owns that villa?

30:24.583 --> 30:25.917
Serbelloni.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.083
Serbelloni who?

30:27.583 --> 30:29.083
My director.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.750
Marquis Serbelloni.

30:32.625 --> 30:36.000
He's having a party
at his villa in Brianza tomorrow night.

30:36.542 --> 30:38.667
And I have nothing to wear.

30:39.292 --> 30:40.292
Secretary?

30:41.333 --> 30:42.375
Coming.

31:01.667 --> 31:02.625
Let's go.

31:11.458 --> 31:12.708
Leonida!

31:22.167 --> 31:23.125
Yvonne?

31:23.833 --> 31:24.708
Hey.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.250
Are you okay?

31:28.500 --> 31:29.375
Yeah.

31:31.292 --> 31:32.292
What's wrong?

31:36.500 --> 31:37.417
Nothing.

31:38.583 --> 31:39.917
I just drank too much.

31:40.417 --> 31:41.667
You drank too much?

31:45.708 --> 31:46.708
Why are you here?

31:55.542 --> 31:56.667
I need a favor.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.167
We need a stamp from the RSI's prefecture.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.417
-A stamp?
-A stamp.

32:05.625 --> 32:10.125
-You'll recognize it because it has--
-I know what the Black Zone stamp is like.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.458
-Please, Yvonne.
-You have no idea.

32:17.542 --> 32:20.417
The prefecture is a slaughterhouse.
There are guards everywhere.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.625
They bring new prisoners in daily.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.667
Borsalino's a monster.
You don't know what he's capable of.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.208
He'll never suspect you.

32:31.500 --> 32:32.333
Please, Yvonne.

32:34.625 --> 32:35.708
Do you trust me?

32:41.750 --> 32:42.750
Bye.

33:35.375 --> 33:37.792
What should I do with you, Lamberti?

33:38.542 --> 33:39.750
I warned you.

33:40.417 --> 33:43.542
Lay your hands
on all of the city's contraband,

33:44.042 --> 33:45.250
but not on my woman.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.000
Don't tell me you're in love?

33:56.208 --> 33:57.125
Lamberti.

33:59.583 --> 34:00.875
A real businessman…

34:02.917 --> 34:04.667
should think with this.

34:09.458 --> 34:10.958
Not with this.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.458
Nor…

34:21.500 --> 34:22.750
with this.

34:43.583 --> 34:44.458
Lamberti?

34:46.292 --> 34:49.125
Leave Yvonne alone,
if you don't wanna be hanged.

34:51.042 --> 34:54.125
You and your ragamuffin friends.

35:02.958 --> 35:05.792
FOUR DAYS TO THE HEIST

35:14.417 --> 35:15.250
Hello.

35:21.667 --> 35:22.833
Do you want it or not?

35:30.875 --> 35:32.875
You sure the weapons are here?

35:32.958 --> 35:35.708
I'm sure.
We just need to make Serbelloni sing.

35:36.292 --> 35:38.375
You ever seen anything like that?

35:39.500 --> 35:40.417
I have.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.542
Hey, Anarchy.

36:02.625 --> 36:04.958
I got you out of that dive
to work, is that clear?

36:05.833 --> 36:09.167
-Unbelievable. You're talking like a lord.
-Who's a lord, sorry?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.875
If Michele heard you…

36:12.708 --> 36:13.542
Hey.

36:14.167 --> 36:16.958
You did a good job with the kid.
He knows his shit.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.708
Michele would be proud of you both.

36:19.792 --> 36:22.375
Doubt it. Pietro became a thief like me.

36:23.708 --> 36:26.167
The truth? It was a fantasy.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.833
The art deco of cinema is over.

36:28.917 --> 36:30.750
Would you like some foie gras, Madam?

36:30.833 --> 36:32.167
Because we artists

36:33.500 --> 36:36.375
have the political and moral duty

36:36.458 --> 36:38.292
to rip apart the Veil of Maya,

36:38.375 --> 36:40.875
between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat.

36:40.958 --> 36:44.000
Because, sorry, Carlo,
the last thing you produced

36:44.083 --> 36:45.167
was awful.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.833
But it's not your fault. I'm the director.

36:48.708 --> 36:51.792
Enough barriers. Enough superstructures.

36:52.375 --> 36:54.000
And that's why I've decided

36:54.500 --> 36:57.625
to shoot my adaptation of <i>Madame Bovary</i>

36:58.375 --> 37:02.542
among the poor fishermen,
<i>les pêcheurs,</i> of Pantelleria.

37:02.625 --> 37:03.708
Camillo, darling.

37:03.792 --> 37:05.875
Tell me I will be your Emma Bovary.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.375
Tell me!

37:07.875 --> 37:08.833
My dear,

37:08.917 --> 37:11.042
my imperishable source of beauty,

37:11.833 --> 37:13.500
you won't be Madame Bovary.

37:13.583 --> 37:14.875
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:14.958 --> 37:16.625
you'll be <i>the one and only</i>

37:17.542 --> 37:18.375
Madame Bovary.

37:20.375 --> 37:23.583
-It will be a success. I can feel it.
-It's inevitable.

37:23.667 --> 37:24.875
-Right, Carlo?
-Thank you.

37:33.917 --> 37:34.917
What's up?

37:39.667 --> 37:40.667
Trouble ahead.

37:46.667 --> 37:48.333
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

37:54.375 --> 37:56.167
Red carpet. The premiere.

37:56.250 --> 37:57.458
And I tell her,

37:57.542 --> 38:00.792
"Nora, don't wear the train."

38:01.375 --> 38:03.833
What does Nora do? She wears the train.

38:03.917 --> 38:05.167
-Champagne?
-No, dear.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.458
-You?
-The heels--

38:06.542 --> 38:07.833
Oh my God! Pardon me.

38:07.917 --> 38:09.542
-There we go.
-Pardon me.

38:09.625 --> 38:10.917
It happens, dear.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.917
-Marquis, forgive me.
-Don't worry, dear.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.750
Imagine that I'd said yes.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.750
Don't worry. <i>C'est la jeunesse.</i>

38:17.833 --> 38:19.042
Only it's silk.

38:19.542 --> 38:22.667
Excuse me. I'll retire to my rooms,
and be right back with you.

38:22.750 --> 38:23.875
For fuck's sake!

38:29.208 --> 38:30.708
What do you expect me to say?

38:31.958 --> 38:33.917
You trust the people,

38:34.667 --> 38:36.250
and this shit happens.

38:41.583 --> 38:42.458
The weapons.

38:51.000 --> 38:51.958
Marcellino.

38:52.667 --> 38:54.292
Marcellino, get the cars ready.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.542
Nation's hero, go keep lookout.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.792
Get to work, guys. Come on!

39:04.000 --> 39:04.875
Serbelloni?

39:06.125 --> 39:09.083
I'm in here! What the fuck do you care?

39:25.250 --> 39:26.625
I have to keep lookout.

39:44.417 --> 39:46.083
Champagne!

39:49.292 --> 39:51.167
-Move it.
-Move it!

40:02.583 --> 40:03.542
Kiss me.

40:17.292 --> 40:20.333
The Casanova of Navigli!
Come on, we have to go.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.875
Uncle!

40:37.542 --> 40:39.167
-Fiorenzo!
-Who the fuck did this?

40:39.250 --> 40:41.417
I don't know. A waiter with a gun!

40:41.500 --> 40:42.708
-What did he want?
-What?

40:42.792 --> 40:43.917
What did he want?

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
The weapons!

40:45.542 --> 40:48.292
Fiorenzo? Fiorenzo!

40:48.375 --> 40:49.250
Untie me!

40:50.042 --> 40:51.708
What the hell?

40:52.417 --> 40:53.458
Come on.

40:54.292 --> 40:56.167
For fuck's sake!

40:56.250 --> 40:57.083
Come on.

41:09.292 --> 41:10.625
Don't move.

41:10.708 --> 41:12.458
Your hands, let me see them.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.125
Who the fuck are you?
How did you know about the weapons?

41:17.208 --> 41:18.208
Turn around!

41:22.750 --> 41:23.583
You?

41:28.833 --> 41:29.708
Where were you?

41:29.792 --> 41:31.500
I turned up in the end, didn't I?

41:31.583 --> 41:33.292
Come on! Can you drive?

41:33.792 --> 41:34.750
Sure!

41:38.083 --> 41:39.500
It's up to Yvonne now.

41:47.583 --> 41:48.667
<i>Citizens.</i>

41:48.750 --> 41:50.125
<i>Workers.</i>

41:50.208 --> 41:52.875
<i>General strike</i>
<i>against the German occupation,</i>

41:52.958 --> 41:56.292
<i>against the fascist war</i>
<i>for the salvation of our lands,</i>

41:56.375 --> 41:58.083
<i>of our houses, our workshops.</i>

42:03.583 --> 42:07.000
<i>As in Genoa and Turin,</i>
<i>make the Germans face the dilemma,</i>

42:07.833 --> 42:10.250
<i>to surrender or perish.</i>

42:55.583 --> 42:56.417
You're here.

42:58.250 --> 42:59.083
Darling.

43:03.292 --> 43:04.542
Shall we go in there?

43:05.125 --> 43:06.875
I want to show you something.

43:06.958 --> 43:08.125
Come on.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.083
No need to be scared.

43:39.958 --> 43:40.875
Attention!

43:41.375 --> 43:43.000
Attention, squad!

43:43.083 --> 43:43.917
Salute!

44:38.875 --> 44:40.042
Let's go.

44:47.583 --> 44:50.708
Twenty years of the nation's glory.

44:52.208 --> 44:53.292
Amazing.

44:56.458 --> 44:57.583
Do you like it?

45:00.750 --> 45:01.583
Whose is it?

45:02.375 --> 45:03.542
It can be yours.

45:04.125 --> 45:05.042
Don't joke.

45:05.625 --> 45:06.958
I'm not joking.

45:12.500 --> 45:13.708
Leave with me.

45:13.792 --> 45:15.500
I'm taking care of everything.

45:15.583 --> 45:17.583
The deal with the Swiss is already done.

45:17.667 --> 45:21.333
We'll travel with Mussolini,
Claretta, and the escort.

45:22.375 --> 45:24.583
Then, when the dust has settled,

45:24.667 --> 45:28.917
we could buy a fazenda
in Argentina or Brazil.

45:29.500 --> 45:30.333
In the sun.

45:31.125 --> 45:32.292
Far from here.

45:33.917 --> 45:35.167
Would you like that?

45:37.333 --> 45:38.250
I don't know.

45:40.208 --> 45:41.750
Nora never wanted a child.

45:44.417 --> 45:45.625
But the two of us…

45:47.458 --> 45:48.833
We could be happy.

45:49.750 --> 45:51.167
We could be a family.

45:53.792 --> 45:55.833
I don't think I'm cut out for motherhood.

45:56.667 --> 45:58.417
You'll be a wonderful mother.

46:00.417 --> 46:03.208
And I will always take care of you.

46:07.292 --> 46:08.250
<i>What's her name?</i>

46:09.500 --> 46:10.667
-Yvonne.
-Yvonne?

46:10.750 --> 46:11.583
Yvonne.

46:12.250 --> 46:13.542
She has a stage name too?

46:13.625 --> 46:15.500
No. Nom de guerre.

46:17.792 --> 46:19.167
Go to her, dumbass.

46:19.250 --> 46:20.375
-What?
-What?

46:20.458 --> 46:22.667
Don't you want a rest? You've earned it.

46:23.167 --> 46:24.500
Well, so have you, right?

46:24.583 --> 46:27.042
We're old. We'll rest when we're dead.

46:27.792 --> 46:29.417
See you at the hideout later.

46:30.667 --> 46:33.333
I knew you'd be a bad influence.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.375
Fuck you.

46:43.208 --> 46:44.167
Achille.

46:49.125 --> 46:50.083
Achille.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.583
Aren't you tired of working?

47:17.500 --> 47:18.500
You're pathetic.

47:22.042 --> 47:24.833
Your little whore
doesn't give a shit about you.

47:24.917 --> 47:26.000
And you know it.

47:26.792 --> 47:28.208
Leave me alone, Nora.

47:30.167 --> 47:33.333
You know who the first
topless actress in Italian cinema was?

47:33.958 --> 47:35.625
-What?
-Answer.

47:38.875 --> 47:41.000
Clara Calamai, <i>The Jester's Supper.</i>

47:41.083 --> 47:42.083
Vittoria Carpi.

47:43.583 --> 47:45.292
-Who's that?
-Artalo's wife.

47:45.375 --> 47:47.333
In Blasetti's <i>The Iron Crown.</i>

47:47.417 --> 47:49.542
A small part of a few seconds.

47:49.625 --> 47:52.833
A meteor. A hummingbird's flutter.

47:52.917 --> 47:54.542
Nobody remembers her.

47:56.125 --> 47:57.000
And so?

47:57.792 --> 47:59.250
You're Vittoria Carpi.

48:00.542 --> 48:02.875
I was born to be loved by others.

48:03.667 --> 48:06.167
In my life,
I've always been a protagonist.

48:07.917 --> 48:10.125
You're just the body double of a leader.

48:10.208 --> 48:12.875
An extra in your own shitty life.

48:16.500 --> 48:19.042
And you're the daughter
of a cart driver from Cremona.

48:19.625 --> 48:21.167
Eleonora Masciocchi.

48:22.000 --> 48:22.958
Shut up.

48:23.042 --> 48:26.417
You've been in more beds than films
to get where you are.

48:27.000 --> 48:27.833
Shut up!

48:44.000 --> 48:45.208
It's over, Nora.

48:51.083 --> 48:52.542
Can I give you some advice?

48:52.625 --> 48:54.667
Find yourself a new benefactor.

48:55.167 --> 48:58.125
These days,
people like you meet a bad end.

48:59.708 --> 49:00.542
Go.

49:02.083 --> 49:03.042
Go!

49:03.708 --> 49:05.167
Go to your whore!

49:07.750 --> 49:09.292
She's waiting for you!

49:17.708 --> 49:22.292
THREE DAYS TO THE HEIST

49:24.167 --> 49:26.500
The siren of the Cabiria, Yvonne!

49:28.625 --> 49:29.458
Brava!

49:30.583 --> 49:31.625
You're beautiful!

51:47.292 --> 51:48.167
Yvonne!

51:50.875 --> 51:52.542
Yvonne!

51:53.083 --> 51:54.333
Don't touch her!

51:56.833 --> 52:00.417
I told you to leave her alone.
You didn't want to listen.

52:17.708 --> 52:20.042
She deserves better than a guy like you.

52:33.167 --> 52:34.042
Yvonne!

52:34.125 --> 52:35.458
Yvonne, we have to go.

52:48.750 --> 52:50.042
Sir!

52:51.083 --> 52:52.875
Get that son of a bitch

52:53.458 --> 52:55.292
and all his friends.

52:56.417 --> 52:58.042
I want them dead!

53:11.583 --> 53:12.958
Can I have a cigarette?

53:14.792 --> 53:15.958
It was my father's.

53:41.500 --> 53:42.458
It's for you.

54:06.583 --> 54:07.667
Get down!

54:15.208 --> 54:17.542
Come on, go!

54:20.417 --> 54:22.625
-The van?
-It's ready. Go!

54:22.708 --> 54:24.292
Go!

54:27.667 --> 54:29.042
Fuck, my rifle!

54:29.625 --> 54:30.625
Marcello!

54:33.875 --> 54:37.083
Marcello!

55:07.042 --> 55:07.875
Isola?

55:08.458 --> 55:09.375
Hey.

55:10.208 --> 55:12.708
-What happened?
-The fascists came to the workshop.

55:12.792 --> 55:14.083
A fucking army.

55:15.708 --> 55:17.625
-Are you okay?
-Sort of.

55:17.708 --> 55:20.417
I stopped the bleeding,
but we need to prevent infection.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.833
Marcello.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.542
Nothing can kill you.

55:29.167 --> 55:30.417
What happened to her?

55:30.500 --> 55:32.917
-I'm fine.
-Of course.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.500
Borsalino. He tried to kill us.

55:35.583 --> 55:36.625
Have we been rumbled?

55:36.708 --> 55:38.250
-What?
-Have we been rumbled?

55:38.833 --> 55:41.583
No. I don't think
he knows about the heist.

55:41.667 --> 55:42.708
Listen.

55:43.375 --> 55:46.583
Let's call a doctor
and end things here. What do you say?

55:46.667 --> 55:49.042
End things here? You want to quit?

55:49.625 --> 55:51.958
Isola, she needs a doctor.

55:52.042 --> 55:53.458
He definitely needs a doctor.

55:53.542 --> 55:55.125
I need a fucking doctor!

55:55.208 --> 55:58.292
No, we can't go. It's too risky.
Borsalino's after us.

55:59.750 --> 56:02.208
What did you do to piss him off so much?

56:36.917 --> 56:38.375
Did you find them?

56:38.458 --> 56:40.208
No. We're looking everywhere.

56:41.750 --> 56:42.917
Yvonne?

56:46.667 --> 56:47.917
How far along are you?

56:52.417 --> 56:53.292
I don't know.

56:55.917 --> 56:57.792
-So it could be--
-No.

57:01.708 --> 57:04.125
It's yours. I'm sorry.

57:04.750 --> 57:06.000
Why are you sorry?

57:07.250 --> 57:08.333
It's a good thing.

57:09.542 --> 57:10.375
Is it?

57:11.792 --> 57:13.958
It'll be the most spoiled kid
in the world.

57:16.958 --> 57:19.333
It'll have everything we never had.

57:24.417 --> 57:25.250
Meaning?

57:26.083 --> 57:27.625
Meaning this is a sign.

57:28.375 --> 57:29.708
A sign of what?

57:29.792 --> 57:31.958
-We have to do the heist.
-Still?

57:33.125 --> 57:35.125
-You'll never make it.
-Yes, we will. Yes.

57:35.208 --> 57:36.542
No. I'm sorry, but no.

57:36.625 --> 57:39.667
I've been to the Black Zone.
It's worse than you all think.

57:41.292 --> 57:42.292
This is suicide.

57:49.208 --> 57:50.958
<i>Did you see Mussolini's treasure?</i>

57:52.708 --> 57:53.583
How was it?

57:55.708 --> 57:57.542
Just like we dreamed.

58:00.250 --> 58:01.417
Who took you there?

58:02.125 --> 58:02.958
Borsalino.

58:13.625 --> 58:14.458
Why?

58:16.667 --> 58:18.375
Isola!

58:30.167 --> 58:31.208
And seven.

58:31.292 --> 58:32.417
You're all here.

58:32.500 --> 58:34.458
Thank God you didn't
get yourselves killed.

58:34.542 --> 58:36.833
I thought I might be too late.

58:36.917 --> 58:38.458
Gianna Ascari, what a pleasure.

58:41.750 --> 58:44.792
-What the fuck do you want?
-I'm here to do business.

58:45.750 --> 58:46.625
Business?

58:46.708 --> 58:48.333
We'll split it 50/50.

58:48.958 --> 58:52.125
Half for me and half for you.
It's more than enough.

58:52.625 --> 58:55.250
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-But I do.

59:14.667 --> 59:15.958
She was spying on us.

59:19.708 --> 59:23.625
The other day, at the Cabiria,
I came to talk to you about Achille.

59:24.792 --> 59:26.792
I wanted to ask you to let him go.

59:28.583 --> 59:29.958
I was expecting an apology.

59:31.250 --> 59:32.292
A little respect.

59:33.750 --> 59:35.750
A little understanding, woman to woman.

59:36.958 --> 59:38.917
<i>But I found something better.</i>

59:46.250 --> 59:47.292
An idea.

59:48.750 --> 59:50.083
They shoot on sight.

59:50.167 --> 59:52.667
Not even a leaf falls
without Borsalino knowing.

59:52.750 --> 59:53.833
That's why you're there.

59:54.792 --> 59:57.917
<i>Leonida and I could never</i>
<i>have got ourselves organized so quickly.</i>

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.667
Since you had a good plan,
I decided to let you go ahead.

1:00:02.042 --> 1:00:03.958
I do not fear the unknown

1:00:04.542 --> 1:00:06.500
as long as my soul doesn't betray me!

1:00:09.875 --> 1:00:12.250
I could've reported you at any time.

1:00:13.167 --> 1:00:14.250
<i>And I didn't.</i>

1:00:14.333 --> 1:00:15.292
<i>This is the plan.</i>

1:00:15.375 --> 1:00:18.833
<i>Everyone will have their part,</i>
<i>so listen up and don't piss me off.</i>

1:00:18.917 --> 1:00:20.250
So, if you agree,

1:00:20.333 --> 1:00:22.958
you carry out the heist,
and I'll keep watching your backs.

1:00:23.042 --> 1:00:25.083
At the end, we split the loot.

1:00:27.375 --> 1:00:30.583
Isn't that what you say
in your slang? "Loot"?

1:00:35.333 --> 1:00:37.250
You hate your husband that much?

1:00:37.333 --> 1:00:39.167
I no longer factored into his plans.

1:00:41.125 --> 1:00:42.708
Unlike someone else.

1:00:43.583 --> 1:00:46.417
He asked her to leave with him.
You didn't know?

1:00:51.917 --> 1:00:53.167
What if I kill you?

1:00:54.833 --> 1:00:56.708
Leonida unleashes my husband on you,

1:00:57.208 --> 1:00:59.583
with his militia,
and all the Germans in the city.

1:00:59.667 --> 1:01:03.375
The treasure's going to Switzerland
with il Duce at dawn, during the curfew.

1:01:06.833 --> 1:01:08.750
Didn't you get the last message?

1:01:12.833 --> 1:01:14.250
<i>Change of plans.</i>

1:01:14.750 --> 1:01:17.250
<i>The Swiss anticipated the border crossing.</i>

1:01:18.708 --> 1:01:20.208
Issue the order to leave.

1:01:21.208 --> 1:01:24.125
I want all our forces
defending the Black Zone.

1:01:24.917 --> 1:01:26.292
What about the prisoners?

1:01:31.167 --> 1:01:32.625
Leave no trace.

1:01:35.792 --> 1:01:36.708
Fire!

1:01:39.792 --> 1:01:43.417
You have… <i>We</i> have around 24 hours.
More or less.

1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:44.375
THREE DAYS

1:01:44.458 --> 1:01:46.875
24 HOURS TO THE HEIST

1:01:50.958 --> 1:01:52.375
You can't be thinking about it?

1:01:52.458 --> 1:01:55.167
There's not much to think about.
It's a reasonable offer.

1:01:55.250 --> 1:01:58.667
Come on, Isola. Who's in charge here,
you or my husband's whore?

1:02:01.542 --> 1:02:02.375
Deal.

1:02:02.458 --> 1:02:03.792
-Isola!
-Hey!

1:02:05.375 --> 1:02:06.292
Deal?

1:02:07.542 --> 1:02:09.792
We'll handle the gold,
she'll handle her husband.

1:02:09.875 --> 1:02:11.542
I see you can use your head.

1:02:13.208 --> 1:02:15.792
-What are you doing? You trust her?
-What do you care?

1:02:15.875 --> 1:02:19.042
-You're risking you and your child's life?
-You wanted to leave with him.

1:02:19.125 --> 1:02:20.708
-What?
-You and the kid, stupid!

1:02:21.250 --> 1:02:23.292
I pity you. Do you see what you've become?

1:02:24.542 --> 1:02:25.417
Let me go.

1:02:29.167 --> 1:02:31.042
How can I be sure it's not his kid?

1:02:49.708 --> 1:02:53.208
-You think you're protecting me?
-I'm not doing this for you.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.125
I have someone else to protect, Pietro.

1:03:08.833 --> 1:03:10.250
The show's over.

1:03:12.542 --> 1:03:13.875
We have until tomorrow night.

1:03:13.958 --> 1:03:16.125
We'll never do it by tomorrow night!

1:03:16.208 --> 1:03:17.417
Then leave.

1:03:18.375 --> 1:03:21.250
If you want to leave, leave!
Whoever stays goes all the way.

1:03:21.833 --> 1:03:23.000
I'm in.

1:03:25.375 --> 1:03:26.208
So am I.

1:03:27.250 --> 1:03:28.292
Fuck il Duce!

1:03:35.458 --> 1:03:36.875
Who the fuck's driving?

1:03:53.333 --> 1:03:54.500
What are you doing?

1:03:55.250 --> 1:03:56.083
Sorry.

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:10.875
Prisoner Pietro Lamberti,
as per Federal Secretary Achille's orders.

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:14.083
Prisoner Pietro Lamberti.

1:04:18.417 --> 1:04:21.208
Prisoner Pietro Lamberti… No.

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:28.917
Pietro Lamberti, on the orders
of Federal Secretary…

1:04:33.750 --> 1:04:35.833
<i>Salute! Documents!</i>

1:04:35.917 --> 1:04:37.917
A prisoner, Pietro Lamberti!

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.958
On the orders of Federal Secretary Achi…

1:04:44.125 --> 1:04:47.167
<i>Salute! Documents!</i>
<i>A prisoner! Pietro Lamberti!</i>

1:04:47.250 --> 1:04:48.625
On the orders… Heil!

1:04:53.417 --> 1:04:56.333
Salute! Documents!
A prisoner! Pietro Lamberti!

1:04:56.417 --> 1:04:59.042
On the orders
of Federal Secretary Achille Borsalino!

1:05:28.667 --> 1:05:30.417
Sorry, we're in a hurry.

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:51.292
1:55 a.m.

1:05:52.750 --> 1:05:53.625
Sirens at 3:00.

1:05:54.375 --> 1:05:57.042
And five minutes later, fireworks.

1:06:03.250 --> 1:06:04.083
You sure?

1:06:04.167 --> 1:06:05.167
Punch me.

1:06:07.583 --> 1:06:09.083
-Harder.
-You sure?

1:06:09.167 --> 1:06:10.167
Harder!

1:06:11.375 --> 1:06:12.333
Harder!

1:06:15.750 --> 1:06:16.917
Another one?

1:06:20.833 --> 1:06:22.000
That's fine, thanks.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:25.958
Let's go!

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.542
ZERO HOURS TO THE HEIST

1:07:06.375 --> 1:07:07.708
What are you carrying?

1:07:07.792 --> 1:07:09.958
A prisoner. Lamberti Pietro.

1:07:38.208 --> 1:07:39.958
NATIONAL REPUBLICAN GUARD

1:07:52.083 --> 1:07:53.708
Refer to the lieutenant on duty.

1:07:56.167 --> 1:07:58.167
-Open the gate!
-Open up.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:14.875
You have to close it, come on!

1:08:39.875 --> 1:08:42.042
Hey! The treasure's in there.

1:09:11.792 --> 1:09:13.417
Torre delle Sirene. Go.

1:09:16.667 --> 1:09:18.208
Come on, pal. Let's go.

1:10:27.375 --> 1:10:29.625
Get out, please. Brigadier.

1:10:31.250 --> 1:10:32.083
Out.

1:10:45.458 --> 1:10:46.667
Who's he?

1:10:46.750 --> 1:10:48.542
Pietro Lamberti. Prisoner.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.458
I haven't been informed.

1:10:54.833 --> 1:10:57.583
On the orders
of Federal Secretary Achille Borsalino.

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:02.500
The secretary hasn't told me anything.

1:11:25.333 --> 1:11:26.208
Follow me.

1:12:12.958 --> 1:12:14.917
You should go. It's almost time.

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.208
-Get a move on. Go on.
-Thanks.

1:12:46.875 --> 1:12:48.917
Shut up, and you won't get hurt.

1:13:04.583 --> 1:13:06.042
You left me no choice.

1:13:08.708 --> 1:13:09.792
What do you want?

1:13:10.792 --> 1:13:11.833
Calm down.

1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:14.000
I don't want to hurt you.

1:13:16.125 --> 1:13:19.042
Nora isn't an easy woman, I admit, but…

1:13:20.958 --> 1:13:22.292
she has one virtue.

1:13:23.125 --> 1:13:24.875
She's always been smart.

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.417
She chose the right man. The right life.

1:13:29.417 --> 1:13:30.750
What did you choose?

1:13:31.625 --> 1:13:32.917
A parasite. A thief.

1:13:35.250 --> 1:13:36.958
Maybe I'm just a whore.

1:13:39.292 --> 1:13:41.583
Maybe we're meant for each other.

1:13:51.417 --> 1:13:53.917
A few hours, and we'll be over the border.

1:13:55.917 --> 1:13:58.792
In time, you'll realize
this was the right choice.

1:14:00.583 --> 1:14:01.542
I love you.

1:14:19.208 --> 1:14:20.042
What is it?

1:14:20.125 --> 1:14:21.250
Excuse me, Secretary.

1:14:21.333 --> 1:14:23.833
A prisoner's been brought
to the depot for you.

1:14:24.458 --> 1:14:25.417
A prisoner?

1:14:26.625 --> 1:14:27.958
Lamberti Pietro.

1:14:34.917 --> 1:14:35.750
Sir?

1:14:36.875 --> 1:14:39.042
I'm on my way.
Don't let him out of your sight.

1:14:52.792 --> 1:14:53.917
EXPLOSIVE

1:15:18.583 --> 1:15:19.708
-Aim.
-Alarm!

1:15:36.250 --> 1:15:37.250
Stop!

1:15:37.750 --> 1:15:39.000
What are you doing?

1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:43.125
Relax, comrade. I'm on patrol too.

1:15:44.417 --> 1:15:47.333
Let me see your documents.

1:15:47.417 --> 1:15:49.750
Yeah, sure.

1:15:50.542 --> 1:15:51.500
Here they are.

1:15:59.083 --> 1:16:00.333
Tie him up!

1:16:01.375 --> 1:16:02.208
Stop!

1:16:34.333 --> 1:16:35.667
Long live anarchy!

1:16:43.083 --> 1:16:43.958
Shit!

1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:48.500
Stop!

1:16:55.250 --> 1:16:56.250
Go!

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:13.000
Let's go! Move!

1:17:24.458 --> 1:17:26.167
You can't leave me too.

1:18:38.083 --> 1:18:40.500
Let's go! Hurry up!

1:18:41.208 --> 1:18:44.708
Fabbri, Fabbri,
we have to lock the shelter's door!

1:18:44.792 --> 1:18:45.708
Come on!

1:18:50.542 --> 1:18:53.583
Fuck you, Fabbri! Fuck you!

1:18:53.667 --> 1:18:56.667
-Go!
-Let's go!

1:19:05.458 --> 1:19:07.000
Go! Quick!

1:19:08.208 --> 1:19:09.250
Go!

1:20:11.833 --> 1:20:12.750
Damn!

1:20:23.500 --> 1:20:25.208
This bar is fucking heavy!

1:20:30.042 --> 1:20:31.250
Look here! Look.

1:20:32.667 --> 1:20:34.417
I'm losing my mind.

1:20:43.750 --> 1:20:44.750
You like it, huh?

1:20:47.292 --> 1:20:48.250
Look at this stuff.

1:20:48.750 --> 1:20:50.250
Start with the gold bars!

1:20:50.333 --> 1:20:52.250
Who the fuck saw this coming?

1:20:54.667 --> 1:20:55.750
Where's Molotov?

1:21:15.250 --> 1:21:16.833
He deserved to at least see it.

1:21:18.583 --> 1:21:20.708
Molotov didn't do it for the money.

1:21:25.417 --> 1:21:27.125
Enjoy your victory.

1:21:27.917 --> 1:21:29.208
It's what you wanted, right?

1:21:31.250 --> 1:21:32.583
I'm a thief, Marcello.

1:21:39.458 --> 1:21:40.833
Come on, let's move it!

1:21:41.583 --> 1:21:43.958
It's not over till we're far from here!

1:21:59.958 --> 1:22:01.000
What are these?

1:22:05.625 --> 1:22:06.500
Wedding rings.

1:22:08.208 --> 1:22:09.125
Donations…

1:22:10.042 --> 1:22:13.042
from all the Italian wives
to fund the war effort.

1:22:16.167 --> 1:22:17.875
My mother donated hers.

1:22:21.167 --> 1:22:22.583
It was her only memory of Dad.

1:22:45.833 --> 1:22:46.958
Your husband?

1:22:47.833 --> 1:22:49.375
Consensual separation.

1:22:51.042 --> 1:22:52.958
Irreconcilable differences.

1:23:15.458 --> 1:23:17.708
Half for you, half for us, as agreed.

1:23:21.958 --> 1:23:22.833
I…

1:23:24.042 --> 1:23:26.125
I don't know how to tell you this, Isola.

1:23:26.708 --> 1:23:28.042
You aren't going anywhere.

1:23:41.208 --> 1:23:42.292
This wasn't the deal.

1:23:42.375 --> 1:23:45.250
Don't preach.
You'd have done the same to me.

1:23:46.208 --> 1:23:47.333
You're right.

1:23:49.458 --> 1:23:51.000
Weapons down! I'm not joking!

1:23:53.125 --> 1:23:54.000
Weapons down!

1:23:57.250 --> 1:23:58.167
Leonida!

1:24:18.125 --> 1:24:21.708
I guess you have no choice
but to let us go.

1:24:23.667 --> 1:24:24.542
Pietro.

1:24:31.625 --> 1:24:32.625
Don't hurt her.

1:24:37.708 --> 1:24:39.583
Maybe your friends didn't understand.

1:24:46.083 --> 1:24:47.583
-Let her go.
-No.

1:24:47.667 --> 1:24:49.500
-Let her go.
-Don't hurt him!

1:24:49.583 --> 1:24:52.125
-Let her go!
-Don't hurt him! Pietro!

1:24:52.208 --> 1:24:55.417
Such a nice girl.
You should've listened to her.

1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:56.708
Bastard!

1:24:59.208 --> 1:25:00.167
Yvonne!

1:25:02.083 --> 1:25:04.625
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

1:25:05.792 --> 1:25:08.292
-On your knees!
-No! Pietro!

1:25:09.208 --> 1:25:10.167
Please!

1:25:10.250 --> 1:25:11.292
Pietro!

1:25:13.917 --> 1:25:15.292
I'm a national hero.

1:25:33.708 --> 1:25:34.875
Go!

1:25:35.417 --> 1:25:36.708
-Come on. This way!
-Go!

1:25:36.792 --> 1:25:37.917
-Come on!
-Marcello!

1:25:46.583 --> 1:25:47.583
Isola!

1:25:47.667 --> 1:25:48.917
-Take cover!
-Ahab…

1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.792
You needed a friend, Isola!

1:25:50.875 --> 1:25:52.208
-Get out of here!
-Go!

1:26:26.292 --> 1:26:27.500
Bomb!

1:26:46.208 --> 1:26:48.042
-Yvonne!
-Pietro!

1:26:52.750 --> 1:26:53.583
Pietro!

1:27:08.750 --> 1:27:10.000
The girl wasn't joking.

1:27:13.167 --> 1:27:14.708
She warned you, didn't she?

1:27:17.500 --> 1:27:20.042
Maybe she knew you'd fuck everything up.

1:27:21.958 --> 1:27:24.167
I know where they're going, Ahab!

1:27:25.083 --> 1:27:27.333
-We can catch up.
-How, Isola? How?

1:27:29.333 --> 1:27:30.833
We can't abandon her, Ahab.

1:27:30.917 --> 1:27:32.917
All the vehicles are damaged.

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.083
-Please--
-Isola.

1:27:34.167 --> 1:27:36.750
There's nothing we can do, Isola.
We've done all we can.

1:27:36.833 --> 1:27:38.958
-You only care about the gold!
-What about you?

1:27:39.042 --> 1:27:40.083
I don't!

1:27:40.167 --> 1:27:41.500
-I don't!
-Weapons down.

1:27:41.583 --> 1:27:43.083
-No! Kill me!
-No.

1:27:43.167 --> 1:27:44.875
-Pietro?
-What?!

1:28:43.917 --> 1:28:45.208
There they are!

1:29:15.833 --> 1:29:16.875
Pietro!

1:29:22.417 --> 1:29:23.417
Pietro!

1:30:35.750 --> 1:30:37.667
Fuck!

1:30:39.417 --> 1:30:40.292
Isola!

1:31:01.500 --> 1:31:02.333
Yes!

1:31:15.125 --> 1:31:16.083
Yes!

1:31:18.625 --> 1:31:20.500
You're alive!

1:31:21.708 --> 1:31:23.333
-I love you.
-Pietro.

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:26.333
I love you.

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.833
May I? No, pretend I'm not here.

1:32:13.208 --> 1:32:14.375
I wonder…

1:32:15.167 --> 1:32:16.667
How deep do you think it is?

1:32:17.458 --> 1:32:18.333
What?

1:32:19.458 --> 1:32:20.708
How deep is the lake?

1:32:22.917 --> 1:32:24.292
Not too deep, I reckon.

1:32:24.875 --> 1:32:26.958
We can retrieve the treasure, then.

1:32:27.458 --> 1:32:29.375
One bar at a time, slowly.

1:32:29.875 --> 1:32:31.125
My cousin's a marine.

1:32:31.208 --> 1:32:32.208
What's up?

1:32:32.708 --> 1:32:33.958
No, nothing.

1:32:34.042 --> 1:32:36.417
You'll have to do it, I can't swim.

1:32:36.500 --> 1:32:37.625
Do you trust me?

1:32:37.708 --> 1:32:39.083
Water isn't my thing.

1:32:39.167 --> 1:32:43.083
When I was a kid, I followed a dog,
fell in the lake and nearly drowned.

1:32:44.250 --> 1:32:45.833
-No.
-So I'm scared of dogs too.

1:32:45.917 --> 1:32:47.250
But don't tell anyone.

1:32:47.333 --> 1:32:50.458
The national hero of Nürburgring
being scared of dogs and water…

1:32:50.542 --> 1:32:52.292
I mean, it'll make me look bad.

1:33:10.125 --> 1:33:12.750
<i>We interrupt this broadcast</i>

1:33:12.833 --> 1:33:16.500

1:33:16.583 --> 1:33:22.292
