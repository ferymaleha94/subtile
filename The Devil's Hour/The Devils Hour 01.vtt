[Gideon] <i>Déjà vu.</i>

<i>They say it's like a short circuit
in the brain.</i>

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.720
<i>Your sense of a moment
placed in your memory centre.</i>

5
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.040
<i>Makes you feel
like you've experienced all this before.</i>

6
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.200
Do you know what I'm talking about?

7
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.560
That feeling.

8
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.880
Have we been here before?

9
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.320
Do we already know one another?

10
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.920
You don't know me.

11
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.240
[Gideon]
I know that you feel out of place.

12
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.920
Detached.

13
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.840
Like your life isn't your own.

14
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.360
I know you wake every night

15
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.200
from a painful dream you never had.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.120
You scared me.

20
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.560
What are you doing down here?

21
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.800
Isaac?

[whispering] What are you doing down here?

23
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.960
Are you okay sweetheart?

24
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.520
Are you okay sweetheart?

25
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.640
Let's get you back to bed.

26
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.400
Go back to sleep.

[Dr Bennett]
<i>And how often do these episodes occur?</i>

30
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.880
About once or twice a month.

31
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.600
[Dr Bennett] So, before the move?

32
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.880
That's right.

33
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.240
Well sleepwalking's really quite common
in children of Isaac's age.

34
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.520
[Lucy ] No, sorry.

35
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.760
This isn't sleepwalking.

36
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.000
This is different.

37
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.600
[Dr Bennett]
And it's just the two of you at home?

38
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.080
Yes.

39
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.200
[Dr Bennett] Does he still see his father?

40
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.160
Not anymore.

41
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680
And how did he react when you told him

42
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.720
that you and your husband were separating?

43
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.240
He didn't.

44
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.080
[Dr Bennett] Isaac, would you like
to come and sit by Mummy?

45
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.440
Thank you.

46
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.080
And how are you feeling today?

47
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.960
Isaac?

48
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.320
Dr Bennett asked you a question,
sweetheart.

49
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.160
Isaac, do you remember
waking up last night and going downstairs?

50
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.680
And do you remember why you did that?

51
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.520
Meredith was crying.

52
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.200
Sometimes Isaac imagines things.

53
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.280
People.

54
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.840
That's quite common, isn't it?
Imaginary friends.

55
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.000
[Dr Bennett] Is that right, Isaac?
Is Meredith your friend?

56
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.840
She can't hear me.

57
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.320
[Lucy] She's been with us since the move.

58
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.960
She's not the first though, is she?

59
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.680
We've had, erm, Barney, Stephanie,

60
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.520
we even had an Alejandro once.

61
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.240
[laughs]

62
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.000
How's he at school?

63
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.520
Fine, I mean, I...
he does well.

64
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.200
No behavioural issues.

65
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.440
Is he always this placid?

66
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.240
He never cries.

67
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.360
He never laughs. He never gets mad.

68
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.840
He's just...

69
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.240
[indistinct whisper]

70
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.080
[Dr Bennett] Did you say something, Isaac?

71
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.040
I'm not supposed to be here.

72
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.560
[Lucy] That's okay.

73
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.480
We're going to go to school just as soon
as we finished with Dr Bennett.

74
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.240
[Dr Bennett] Oh, Ruby, please.

75
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.360
Ruby.

76
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.680
[Dr Bennett] And there is an instance
of schizophrenia in the family?

77
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.120
Er, sorry?

78
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.400
Your mother.

79
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.840
Er, Dr Harper ruled out schizophrenia.

80
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.976
[Dr Bennett] And what about your father?

81
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.760
Are there any issues
on that side of the family?

82
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.200
[sighs] Not that I know of.

83
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.520
He died when I was young.

84
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.680
Brain aneurysm.

85
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240
It's not schizophrenia.

86
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.000
It's not autism.

87
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.520
There is no easy answer here, believe me.

88
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.840
You're actually doctor number seven.

89
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.360
Lucky number seven, I hope.

90
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.960
I'll do what I can.

[Karen] Luce?

94
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.520
No, I understand. Erm.

95
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.400
Thing is Karen,
we're overstretched as it is.

96
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.040
Yeah? What about Mark?
When's the last time he did a home visit?

97
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.280
Mark?

98
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.600
Mark doesn't use cash because he read
it's covered in vaginal bacteria.

99
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.880
He actually put that in writing.
I have got it in an email.

101

Bedwetting.

[Karen] Yes.

103
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.680
The mum doesn't change her sheets,
so it's disgusting.

104
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.840
[Lucy] Was Rob with you?

105
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.000
No, of course not.

106
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.760
Rob should come with you next time.

107
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.280
Bedwetting could be a sign of abuse,
we need to rule that out.

108
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.880
No, Luce, it's not about
whether the kid's being abused...

109
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.000
Yes, it is.

110
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.280
No, what I mean is...

111
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.640
This is the job, Karen.

[knock on door]

113
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
Yeah?

114
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.840
He's here.

115
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.760
Mr Fisher, my name is Lucy Stephens.
You've already met Rob.

116
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.880
[Shane] Yeah.

117
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.640
[Lucy] Rob and I have both
been working on your case.

118
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.640
As you know, he's made several visits
to your family home.

119
00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.200
No.

120
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.040
You weren't aware of that?

121
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.040
No. Don't know nothing about it.

122
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.320
With respect,
the situation's been made quite clear.

123
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.120
[Shane] What's this about?

124
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.600
'Cause I've got stuff to do.

125
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.040
We have several police reports
of violent incidents of assault.

126
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.480
Some historic.

127
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.240
You're currently on bail
for the most recent charge.

128
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.480
Yeah.

129
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.760
Chloe tells us
that you physically assaulted her

130
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.080
and that you threatened
the safety of your daughter.

131
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.600
Nah. She says that, but it's not true.

132
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.840
I didn't do that.

133
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.240
- You didn't...
- I didn't threaten Tilly.

134
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.640
All right?

135
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.760
I wouldn't hurt her. That's bollocks.

136
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.200
She's making that up.

137
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.360
But there was an incident of assault...

138
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880
...Mr Fisher.

139
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.200
She pushed me, I pushed back.

140
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.640
Are you aware that you're not permitted

141
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.480
to have any contact with your family
at this time?

142
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.760
Three days ago, you approached Chloe
outside your daughter's school.

143
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.400
- She was carrying your son in a...
- He's not mine.

144
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.720
Look, she's not taking her
away from me, all right?

145
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.280
That's my daughter.

146
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.080
I love her,
I wouldn't do nothing to hurt her.

147
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.320
I want to be very clear with you,
Mr Fisher.

148
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.840
If there are any further incidents,

149
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.640
we're going to need to consider
child protection measures.

150
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.960
Do you understand?

151
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040
Is that it?

152
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480
This is very serious, Shane.

153
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.920
Yeah.

154
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.440
- [Rob] If you approach your family...
- [Shane] Yeah, I get it.

Yeah.

160

It's always nice to meet new people.

Early fifties. Stabbed three times.

but of course she won't listen.

333
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.520
Well, she can't fucking listen,
can she? [laughs]

334
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.560
Joan?

335
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.040
- I reckon she's outside.
- No, no, no, no.

336
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.040
You just stay there Mr Bell,

337
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.000
I'll go.

338
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.880
[sighs]

339
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.320
[Mr Bell] Vanette.

340
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.800
[Ravi] I'm sorry?

341
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.440
That's what it's called.

342
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.120
Nissan Vanette.

343
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.280
A red Nissan Vanette,
you're absolutely sure?

344
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.600
Yeah, it's a big chunky thing
with, er, bull bars.

345
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.000
Well, you don't see them
around much anymore, do you?

346
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.200
No, you don't.

347
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.560
[suspenseful music playing]

348
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.200
[Archie, distorted] <i>Oi, mate,</i>

349
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.840
out my way, you knobhead.

350
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.680
[suspenseful music playing]

351
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.560
[unzips zipper]

352
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.760
[suspenseful music playing]

353
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.800
[bell rings]

354
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.640
Well, none of us saw it happen.

355
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.776
He says it was an accident.

356
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.040
[Lucy] Then it was. He doesn't lie.

357
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.800
Isaac's not in trouble, Mrs Stephens.

358
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.960
Chambers. Stephens was my married name.

359
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.440
[woman] Chambers, sorry.

360
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.600
I'll get reception to update your details.

361
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.400
Well, I'll pay for the damage.

362
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.280
That's not really the issue here.

363
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.320
One of those bags belonged to a boy
who was picking on Isaac.

364
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920
What boy?

365
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.760
He's been disciplined.

366
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.440
We take bullying very seriously,

367
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.960
even if it is just a bit of teasing.

368
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.240
Define teasing.

369
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.320
Name-calling. Silly things.

370
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.400
Still, he knows it was wrong
and he apologised.

371
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480
Tell me his name.

372
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.760
[Isaac] Archie.

373
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.520
Archie?

374
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.200
What does Archie do to you?
Does he call you names?

375
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.240
Does it upset you?

376
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.200
Is that why you weed on his bag?

377
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.080
[whispering] They moved the toilets.

378
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.600
No. No sweetheart, they didn't.

379
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.200
Isaac knows full well
where the toilets are,

380
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.480
don't you, Isaac?

381
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.800
[Lucy] Come on.

382
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.040
- Say sorry.
- Sorry.

383
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.960
We'll pay for the bags.

384

[gasps] Isaac.

391
00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.760
What are you doing?

392
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.800
Go back to bed.

393
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.360
[sighs]

394
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Isaac!

[sighs]

396
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.080
Go to bed.

397
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.160
Shut your eyes.

398
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.480
Shut your eyes.

399
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.120

[laughs]

402
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.920
Isaac?

403
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.680
[suspenseful music playing]

404
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.360
Oh.

405
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.440
Fuck. [sniffles]

406
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.000
Isaac?

407
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.480
I'm sorry darling.

408
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.960
Mummy's sorry she yelled at you.

409
00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.120
[whispers] Come here and give me a cuddle.

410
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.880
[Isaac whispers] Who's that man?

411
00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.280
What's that darling?

412
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.520
Who's that man?

413
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.840
What man?

414
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.480
What man, sweetheart?

415
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.960
He's gone now.

416
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.440
Mummy's going to make you better.

417
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.800
I promise.

418
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.920
Go to sleep.

419
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.960
[dog barking in the distance]

420
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.880
[knocking]

421
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.520
[Lucy] Chloe Fisher?

422
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.200
- [dog barking]
- Yeah.

423
00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.720
My name's Lucy Chambers,
I'm from children's services.

424
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.960
Can I come in?

425
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.120
[baby crying]

426
00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.960
[Lucy] As you know,
we spoke to your husband,

427
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.600
just to get his side of the story.

428
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.040
Oh, thank you very much.

429
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.120
But just to be clear,
has there been any contact

430
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.040
since the incident at school?

431
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.280
He was here this morning.

432
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.640
What, here at the house?

433
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.560
He said he wanted to see Tilly.

434
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.560
Did you let him in?

435
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360
No.

436
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.760
And what did he do then?

437
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.280
He got angry.

438
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.560
Shouting, swearing.

439
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.920
Saying he was... [whispers]
he was gonna kill himself.

440
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.520
I told him, don't you say stuff
like that in front of Tilly,

441
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.800
I, I wasn't standing for it.

442
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.200
People was looking.

443
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.560
I said if he didn't go,
I'd call the police.

444
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.160
And did you?

445
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.880
Chloe?

446
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.520
Did you call the police?

447
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.720
Oh.

448
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.600
We made it very clear
that Shane was to have

449
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.640
no contact with you or with Tilly.

450
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.776
If he's not adhering to that,
we're going to need to consider

451
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.040
child protection measures.

452
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.720
Now if he turns up here again,
I want you to...

453
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.040
[tense music playing]

454
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.240
[Chloe] Look, I shoved him first.

455
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.760
Outside the school. I, I started it.

456
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.200
Don't let him into this house.

457
00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.360
Chloe, I want you to promise me.

458
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.320
Okay, we can find you
somewhere safe to stay.

459
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.000
We're not leaving.

460
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.720
Erm...

461
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.080
I'm going to give you my mobile number.

462
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.320
So, if you are worried,
I want you to call me.

463
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.560
Day or night.

464
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.680
Doesn't matter.

465
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.280
I mean it, Chloe.

466
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.480
Day or night.

467
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.160
Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.280
Okay.

469
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.640
Bye Tilly.

470
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.400
Bye.

471
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.960
Hey...

472
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.520
Thanks.

473
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.880

[machine beeping]

475
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.880
[sighs] Fuck's sake.

476
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.040
[Nick] That's every Nissan Vanette

477
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.040
still registered in the county.

478
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.440
I wish we were back in the city.

479
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.136
Honestly, I don't know how
they cope round here.

480
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160
Come on.

481
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.576
I thought you youngsters
were supposed to be good

482
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.680
with computers.

483
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.000
[Ravi] I'm 35.

484
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.360
Really? You've got a young face.

485
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.200
I like your screensaver

486
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.960
- [Ravi] Jonah Taylor's teddy bear.
- [Nick] Yeah, I know.

487
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.640
We all remember little Horton.

488
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.416
The day they found him
was the beginning of the end.

489
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.000
Hobson.

490
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.320
Bear's name was Hobson.

491
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.960
Yeah. Hobson, right.

492
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.440
This is all a bit
before your time, isn't it?

493
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.720
I read her blog, Miranda Taylor.

494
00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.520
She still updates it, even now.

495
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.080
Well, I never met her.

496
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.080
I know a lot of people who did though.

497
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.520
Not a very pleasant woman,
by all accounts.

498
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.600
She lost her son,
how pleasant would you be?

499

to blame us, did she?

evidence from the press.

to be going over old ground,

516

but, erm, I wanted to verify

517
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.160
some of Dr Harper's
observations for myself,

518
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.760
and to be honest with you,

519
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.200
these notes don't make
a great deal of sense to me.

- No.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.840
I can't get warm.

662
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.720
I'm cold.

663
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.880
Why is it always so cold?

664
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.600
Oh, shut up, shut up. Shut up!

665

[whimpers]

666
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.360
Here.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.200
Here.

668
00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480
Hold it.

669
00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.520
Here you go.

670
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.400

It's okay.

677
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.000
I'm not going anywhere.

678
00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.560
It's going to be okay.

[woman] Not much traffic up here.

681
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.296
There's a farm up on the hill,
a couple of houses at the end of the lane.

682
00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.440
One of them's empty.

683
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.400
[Nick] Registration's a match.
Council confirmed it.

684
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.120
How far away is this farm?

685
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.520
- [woman] About a mile, mile and a half?
- [Nick] Okay.

686
00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.600
- Find out what they know.

690
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.480

Just had to park at the right angle,
he's got himself a 24-hour stream.

694
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.480
That's how he knew Slade's routine.

695
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.360
Without getting too close.

696
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.680
So, he's a clever bastard.

697
00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.560
Maybe not.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.720
He's been driving on that for a while.

701
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.000
[woman] Could have gone looking for help.

702
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.600
Or another vehicle.

703
00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.360
Not many options round here.

Guess we go knocking on some doors.

705
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.200
We can start
with whichever one this opens.

706
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.360
Find the cheapest hotel in the area.

707
00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.680
I doubt he's fussy.

708
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.640
Do you think he'll go back there?

709
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.400
Not without the key,

710
00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.560
but someone took his booking,

711
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.440
which means, someone's seen his face.

I was just, uh, passing by.

Yeah, it's not a good time, I'm working.

- [Lucy] Mm-hm.

Just tired.

723
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.360
We could just talk?

724
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.200
I don't want to talk.

Okay.

you need to call the police.

He's not normally this bad.

- [Ravi] How long has he been staying here?
- He don't stay.

770
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.880
Not often.

771
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.440
He's had the lodge about nine, ten years.

That doesn't strike you as odd?

773

[Mrs Jones] He pays cash.

A year in advance.

775
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.400
As far as I'm concerned,
he can stay as long as he wants.

776
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.240
Fair enough.
And I assume you asked for his name?

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.960
Asked for one, didn't get one.

778

Like I said, he pays cash.

779

Didn't look like he was
going to get a lot of post.

[Nick] What did he look like?

781
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.960
Serious. Scruffy.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.200
Maybe 50's, 60's.

- Irish?

Same difference.

When was the last time you saw him?

790
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.320
Two, three months ago.

791
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.600
I'd had to check.

792

And, uh...

do you Mrs Jones?

Now.

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.160
What breed of dog is that?

804
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.440
Well, he's all right.

805
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.200
That's just Spud.

806
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.840
I didn't ask his name, I asked his breed.

807
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.840
- Looks like a pit bull terrier to me.
- So what?

808
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.240
It's a banned breed.

809
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.480
Sorry, I'm sure you know that.

810
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.840
As I'm sure you can provide us
a certificate of exemption.

811
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.680
Now, you can show us the room,

812
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.800
or we can sit and we can
talk about Spud a bit longer.

813
00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:55.920
Maybe seize him under section 19
of the police and criminal evidence act?

814
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.960
Your choice.

815
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.240
You okay, Dhillon?

816
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.600
I'm fine.

817
00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.840
Probably best if I go in first, eh?

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.440
Yeah.

for that padlock on here?

820
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.560
That's not supposed to be there.

821
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.960
Allow me.

822
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.440

<i>The dissonance.</i>

831
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.880
Like something wasn't meant to be.

832
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.280
Something changed.

833
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.720
Changed from what?

834
00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.000
This is today.

[Nick] Dhillon.

[Gideon] Do you remember
this conversation?

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.840
How would I?

838
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.520
[Gideon] Well, maybe you dreamt it?

839
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.320
Maybe it's in there somewhere.

Will you answer a question for me?

844
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.960
It might sound strange.

845
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.560
What's the worst thing
you've ever experienced?

All of this.

849
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.600
You.

850
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.480
I'm sorry Lucy.

851
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.600
I'm sorry but you've suffered
far worse than me.
