4
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.400
[Dhillon] Mummy went up to your bedroom,
but you were gone.

5
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.120
Do you remember what happened?

6
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.440
A man came.

7
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.280
There was a man in your bedroom?

8
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.600
[Isaac] He said it wasn't mine.

9
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.360
He wanted me to go.

10
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.880
Where did you go, Isaac?

11
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.440
To the woods.

12
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.120
[Dhillon] And how did you get there?

13
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.640
In a car.

14
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.160
Do you remember what the car looked like?

15
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.080
Black.

16
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.240
Isaac, what happened
when you got to the woods?

17
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.800
They left me.

18
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.640
[Nick] Who left you?

19
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.600
[ominous music playing]

20
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.880
[whispering] Just stay here.

21
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.680
I'll find someone
to take the kid back to the station.

22
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.280
[Lucy] He remembers what people say.

23
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.440
It's like a photographic memory
but with words.

24
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600
Can you remember
what else they said, Isaac?

25
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.160
Keep the door locked.

26
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.680
It's okay, she's coming back.

27
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.960
You're okay.

28
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.840
How about we listen to some music?

29
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.080
[Nick]
Who wanted to listen to music?

30
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.440
The man in the black car?

31
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.760
Have you ever seen him before?

32
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.160
Could you tell us what he looks like?

33
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.560
[ominous music playing]

34
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
[indistinct chatter]

35
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.360
Left these on the printer.

36
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.680
Thanks.

37
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.840
[Nick] Not our case anymore.

38
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.176
MCIS know you're holding evidence?

39
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.560
It's just personal interest.
Don't worry about it.

40
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.000
I'm not worried.

41
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.600
Here, take a look at this
from my fly-tipping hotspot.

42
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.920
[Dhillon] How did you get this?

43
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.880
Old colleague of mine
moved to MCIS a year ago.

44
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.040
He's my man on the inside.

45
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.960
What about the other cameras?

46
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760
Nah, wrong angles, didn't catch anything.

47
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.080
Must have spotted this one though,
got spooked.

48
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.000
Drove off in a hurry.

49
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.680
Lost a hubcap.

50
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.320
Can we ID the vehicle?

51
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.640
We can narrow it down.

52
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.440
Rough shape, wheel size, tyre tread.

53
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.520
Might find something
we can work into your theory.

54
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.080
What about MCIS?
What's their theory?

55
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Snuff films. Porn.

56
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.560
Whatever Slade had goin' on in
that basement, our suspect was in on it.

57
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.040
But they had a disagreement.

58
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.840
Our man killed Slade,
starts workin' alone.

59
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.440
Great.

60
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.360
Now work in Shane Fisher,
the dead dog, the watch...

61
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.616
The watch wasn't stolen,
the boy said he was wearin' it.

62
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.320
Isaac hadn't worn that watch for years

63
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.880
and our suspect had
a picture of it on his wall.

64
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.680
- Make sense of that.
- [Nick] Don't have to.

65
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200
It's not our case anymore.

66
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.000
How many times you watched that?

67
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.360
I'm just listening to music.

68
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.080
Right, silly me.

69
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.600
[ominous music playing]

70
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.400
[Nick on video] <i>Could you tell us
what he looks like?</i>

71

[sighs]

72
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.920
[Dhillon] <i>Have you always believed
in the supernatural?</i>

73
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.160
Define "supernatural."

74
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.480
[Dhillon] Clairvoyance, precognition,

75
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.200
you seem to have
a distorted relationship with time.

76
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.640
My perception of time
is better than anyone's.

77
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.040
You think you see the future.

78
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.440
I don't see it, I remember it.

79
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.800
[Dhillon] And in this delusion of yours,

80
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.440
are you a time traveller
or a fortune teller?

81
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.000
Neither and both.

82
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.880
Do you know what I'm gonna say next?

83
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.760
"No more questions,
Mr Shepherd, you're free to go."

84
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.240
- [Dhillon scoffs] That's funny.
- That's funny.

85
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.320
Sorry, should have seen that coming.

86
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.840
What about those cuffs?

87
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.160
Did you see those coming?

88
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.960
Eventually.

89
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.640
I knew you wouldn't give up,

90
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.920
not after what happened
with Aiden Stenner.

91
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.280
But you probably
don't want to talk about that.

92
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.320
[Kate] I don't know
what you want me to say.

93
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.400
You could start by telling us
where Aiden is.

94
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.720
When did you last see him?

95
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.320
Saturday. No, erm, Friday.

96
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.960
So why didn't you report him missing?

97
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.680
[Kate] He's not missing,
he's just not here.

98
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.000
He does what he likes.

99
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.200
- He's 17. Kate.
- 18 in January.

100
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.920
But 17 now which means
it's still our job to look out for him

101
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.720
and we can't do that
unless you tell us where he is.

102
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.200
Fuck sake, he's just staying with mates.

103
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.280
Yeah, well what is he doing for money?

104
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.760
Kate, we need names and addresses.

105
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.120
You could try Mia Thomas.

106
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.760
Right. Who's that?

107
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.960
[Kate] Used to live downstairs.
They had a thing.

108
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.240
- And where does she live now?
- I don't know. Ask her mum.

109
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.920
Number eight. I need a piss.

110
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.040
Oh.

111
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.960
Of course you do. [sighs]

112
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.880
I mean, whose case was this?

113
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.080
[sighs] It's Karen's.
Look it's not her fault.

114
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.800
These last two weeks have been a mess.

115
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.040
I'll have to tell my son
to stop getting kidnapped.

116
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.920
[Rob] Could you?

117
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.280
- 'Cause I got no idea how to do your job.
- You did fine, Rob, honestly.

118
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.680
Thank you for stepping up, appreciate it.

119
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.360
If you need more time,
you know you should take it.

120
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.640
I guess she moonlights
as a birthday clown.

121

122
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.640
Mm.

123
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.760
Oh, nitrous oxide,
do you think she's got any more?

124
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840
I could do with a laugh.

125
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.400
Oi, are you taking pictures?

126
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.720
Why are you taking pictures?

127
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.896
- I'm talkin' to you.
- [Rob] Calm down.

128
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.016
Why are you taking pictures?
Why are you takin' pictures?

129
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.240
- Stop.
- Are you fuckin' deaf or something? Oi!

[screams]

131
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.520
Are you gonna calm down?

132
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.720
- Are you gonna calm down?
- Yes.

133
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.720
Yes. [breathes heavily]

134
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.880
Fuckin' bitch.
I'm phoning the police.

135
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.760
Are you all right?

136
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.200
How did you do that?

137
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.880
I have no idea.

Could you stay perfectly still
just for one second?

Is it dying?

143
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.280
Just needs some food.

144
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.520
Bees are key to our survival.

145
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.640
Without bees, there's no crops.

146
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.960
No crops, no food.
No food, no us.

147
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.440
My sister's allergic to bee stings.

148
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.640
That flies off and sticks her,
it's on you.

[laughs]

150
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.240
It feels good.

151
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.120
It's only a small thing
but making one life a little better

152
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.800
without making something worse.

153
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.280
I ran over a dog two weeks ago on purpose.

154
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.320
Then I reversed over
its head just to make sure.

155
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.360
It belonged to a four-year-old girl.

you say anything.</i>

It's a bit out of the blue.

[Lucy] <i>I nearly lost him.</i>

164
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.720
Yeah, no, I know, I know.

165
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.200
Erm... [clears throat] And I get why
you've been ignoring my calls too.

166
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.040
And I fucked up.

167
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.400
<i>But I just... I wanna try again, you know.</i>

168
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.840
For him or for me?

169
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.240
[Mike] <i>Both.</i>

170
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.960
I was thinking that, erm,
I was thinking we could all go

171
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.600
to your mum's old cottage,
just the three of us.

172
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.800
Uh, I've got people booked in.

173
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.040
[Mike] <i>Well, cancel 'em.</i>

174
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.600
<i>Say there's a, a damp problem
or something.</i>

175
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.600
There is a damp problem.

176
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.336
Well, there you go.
You don't even need to lie.

177
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.360
[Lucy laughs]

178
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.360
Let me think about it.

179
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.560
Okay.

180
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.920
- [Lucy] <i>Bye Mike.</i>
- Bye.

181
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.560
[sighs]

182
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.280
[doorbell rings]

183
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.800
- Hi.
- Sorry, I know it's late.

184
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.640
It's fine.
I thought you were back in the city?

185
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.960
[Dhillon] I am.

186
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.280
I was. Erm, I wanted to give you this.

187
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.440
What is it?

188
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.880
Isaac's interview.

189
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.640
You said a psychiatrist
wanted to see the footage.

190
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.040
You said you couldn't give me this.

191
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.640
I can't.

192
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.000
So don't lose it.

193
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.360
And don't make copies.

194
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.720
Thanks. I won't.

195
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.600
And, erm, let me know
what she says, okay?

196
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.640
I will.

197
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.600
Do you wanna come in?

198
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.016
- Actually I wanted to ask you something.
- [smoke alarm blaring]

199
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.160
Oh, shit. Erm, uh, come in,
come in, come in, come in.

200
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.120
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, ah.

201
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.640
[alarm stops]

202
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.080
[Lucy laughs]

203
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.520
[Dhillon] Yup, that's, uh, broken.

204
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.880
[Lucy] Erm...

205
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.840
Oh, I mean...

206
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.800
[Dhillon] This, erm,
this doesn't seem like a good time.

207
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.400
Well, it is not.

208
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.760
But you don't get to run away,
this is entirely your fault.

209
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.080
It was. I'm sorry.

210
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.200
You will be.
Now you have to make us dinner.

211
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.960
- [Dhillon] Do I?
- Obviously.

212
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.120
- What would you like?
- I'm not fussy.

213
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.200
- Isaac likes lobster.
- [laughs]

214
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.440
What did you wanna ask me?

215
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.080
Slade's house.

216
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.080
You say you guessed the code to his safe.

217
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.120
Uh, classical music fan,

218
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.000
1812. I mean, it's not much of a stretch.

219
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.880
And the violin?

220
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.480
You asked me if Slade kept
a violin above his stairs.

221
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.000
[sighs]

222
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.536
I'm sorry, I know this is probably
the last thing

223
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.320
you want to think about right now.

224
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.080
I remembered it.

225
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.840
So you have been there before?

226
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.960
[Lucy] No.

227
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.880
But I remember it now

228
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.400
and it's like...
the memory already existed

229
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.200
before... somehow.

230
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.840
What else do you remember?

231
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.840
Uh, I remember the house,

232
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.840
that awful room in the basement.

233
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.000
<i>Those two little girls
from the photographs,</i>

234
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.440
dead, being pulled from the water.

235
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.200
[Dhillon] That didn't happen.

236
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.000
Those girls are alive.

237
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.280
I spoke to them myself.

238
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.960
Yeah, sometimes I remember it wrong.

239
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.880
Hello, sweetheart.

240
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.880
You okay?

241
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.400
I'm cold.

242
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.960
You're cold?

243
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.640
Aw, come here.

244
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.440
Oh, you don't feel cold.

245
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.800
Isaac, do you remember Detective Dhillon?

246
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.640
Hello, Isaac.

247
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.120
Manly handshake?

248
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.120
Tap it.

249
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.280
Back, now three bumps.

250
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.440
One, two, three.

251
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.720
Explode it, hold it.

252
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.280
High five.

253
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.760
That is a very secret

254
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.800
policeman's handshake.

255
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.560
Don't tell anyone I showed you, okay?

256
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.040
- Okay.
- Okay.

257
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.560
You're my undercover officer now.

258
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.480
You need to keep an eye
on your mum for me.

259
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.760
Make sure she doesn't
do anything dangerous.

260
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.560
Like try to cook dinner.

261
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.080
I've heard the best way
to get warm is hot chocolate.

262
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.240
Lots and lots of hot chocolate.

263
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.320
Okay.

264
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.320
Well, I tell you what, you can have
a hot chocolate if you lay the table.

265
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.480
Mummy is gonna get a takeaway
because she's useless.

266
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.440
[laughs]

267
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.480
Would you like to stay for a Chinese?

268
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.240
Oh, uh, I shouldn't, but thanks.

269
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.160
Are you sure?

270
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.680
[Dhillon] Yeah, things to do.
Early start tomorrow.

271
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.480
[Lucy] How far is home?

272
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.640
Back in the city.
Hour or so.

273
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.240
You came all this way?

274
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.080
It's good to see you again, Isaac.

275
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.760
Look at that, got it in one.

276
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.040
- Great work.
- [laughs]

277
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.280
Take care of your mum, okay?

278
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.640
Okay.

279
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.320
[Lucy] DI Dhillon?

280
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.800
- Ravi.
- Ravi.

281
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.320
Oh, I know I shouldn't ask you this,

282
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.616
you can tell me to piss off if you want.

283
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.640
Piss off.

284
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.800
What is it?

285
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.200
I have this case at work, a kid...

286
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.400
well, he's 17.

287
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.760
Aiden Stenner,
his mum hasn't seen him for days,

288
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.080
sounds like drugs.

289
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480
Right.

290
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.720
He has a friend, Mia, Mia Thomas.

291
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.160
Would you write it down?

292
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.880
And you've already reported this?

293
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.560
Yeah, I just don't know
how seriously they're taking it.

294
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.880
It's just a teenager shacked up
with his girlfriend.

295
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.680
So why are you so worried?

296
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.920
It's my job to worry.

297
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.200
I'll ask around,
see whose desk it landed on.

298
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.480
Maybe I can oil the wheels.

299
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.040
- Thank you.
- No problem.

300
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.240
I'm sorry about your dinner.

301
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.440
You should be. [laughs]

302
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.160
[dramatic music playing]

303
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.760
[muffled]
Yeah, wait for your plate.

304
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.920
If you keep picking there'll be none left.

305
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.160
It's comin', it's comin'.

306
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.880
Hold on.

307
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.160
- [laughing]
- Just wait, just wait!

308
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.200
You need to hurry,
she is really nearly done.

309
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.616
[Lee] All right, here it comes,
here it comes.

310
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.520
- [Debbie] Smells good.
- I know. Get out of it.

311
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.560
[laughing] A little bit.

312
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.976
Beef, you're not coming for my beef.

313
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.200
All right, bye, bye.

314
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.560
More? You've had
about a thousand as it is.

315
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.200
How many, how many do you want?

316
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.280
[muffled conversation continues]

317
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520
[door opens]

318
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.000
[sighs]

319
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.480
[slow music playing]

320
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.320
[grunts]

321
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.280
[tense music playing]

322
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.000
- [Nick] Oh, you bloody prick.
- [Dhillon] What?

323
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.520
Now, I see why you wanted
to use my car.

324
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.000
- It's inconspicuous.
- [Nick] Bollocks.

325
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.320
You just worried about someone
keying your paintwork.

326
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.640
It's not insured is it?

327
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.080
Because this isn't
official police business?

328
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.280
You see, I know what you're doin'.

329
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.400
Relax.
We'll be five minutes, tops.

330
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.280
That's the way it works now, is it?

331
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.480
She says, "jump," you say,
"how high?"

332
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.360
- Who?
- You know who.

333
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.120
Mystic Meg and the demon child.

334
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.016
- Your fancy woman.
- She's not my fancy woman.

335
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.320
- [scoffs]
- Fuck off.

336
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.880
[Cheekbones] What?

337
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.440
Do you live here?

338
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.640
Maybe.

339
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.880
We're looking for Mia Thomas.
You seen her?

340
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.120
[Cheekbones] Mia!

341
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.760
What do you want?

342
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.120
Are you Mia?

343
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.880
We understand
you know Aiden Stenner.

344
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960
Who are you?

345
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.800
He's not in trouble,
we just wanna make sure he's all right.

346
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.120
Are you police?

347
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.680
Like I said, he's not in trouble.

348
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.720
Just your name on the lease,
is that right?

349
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400
Yeah.

350
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.040
Who's that lot then?

351
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.200
- Friends.
- A lot of friends.

352
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.360
Do they sleep over?

353
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.800
Are you all right with that?

354
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.600
[Cheekbones]
Mia, shut the fucking door!

355
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.920
Aiden's not here.

356
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.960
[laughter]

357
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040
Don't.

358
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.760
Walk away.

359
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.240
That's cuckooing.

360
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.560
I bet my life on it.

361
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.960
How many guys do you think
she's got squatting in there?

362
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.160
Too many.
I don't like your chances.

363
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.720
I don't like her chances,
cooped up with scum like that.

364
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.256
They'll do worse than scratch your car.

365
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.440
- Come on, be clever.
- You're the clever one.

366
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.520
- We're not even supposed to be here.
- So what?

367
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.440
- What? We just ignore it?
- No. But we do this properly.

368
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.640
I'll say we're following up
on an anonymous tip, okay.

369
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.880
I'll log it this afternoon.

370
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.080
Hey, what you doing tonight?

371
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.800
Chilli con Carne.

372
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.680
Sod it.

373
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.640
Never been a fan of Bella's chilli.

374
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.360
Don't tell her I said that.

375
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.160
[Dr Bennett]
This is a nice watch, isn't it?

376
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.360
Did Mummy get it for you?

377
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.200
- It's broken.
- [Dr Bennett] Yeah, yeah,

378
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.120
I can see the strap's broken, isn't it?

379
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.800
Do you remember how that happened?

380
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.920
It got caught on the window.

381
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.360
[Dr Bennett] Got caught.

382
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.000
Is that when you were
climbing into the house?

383
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.680
Mm.

384
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.120
[Dr Bennett] Mummy says
you don't normally wear this.

385
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.600
Did someone tell you to put it on?

386
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.080
You just wanted to?

387
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.960
Mummy likes me to wear it.

388
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.440
[Dr Bennett]
Wanted to make mummy happy?

389
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960
[scoffs]

390
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.560
[Dr Bennett] Isaac,
how did you find the house?

391
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.160
I walked.

392
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.440
Who was in the house, Isaac?

393
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.160
No one.

394
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.640
[Dr Bennett] So, you slept there

395
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.600
for two nights all on your own?

396
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.520
Oh, where?

397
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.960
On the floor.

398
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.080
So you slept there and then you left.

399
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.280
Why did you leave?

400
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.800
I was cold.

401
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.720
He keeps saying he's cold.

402
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.240
He's never said that before.

403
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.120
I mean, he's been cold before,

404
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.400
I've heard his teeth chattering,
but he's never said it.

405
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.520
Like...

406
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.480
Like it upsets him,
like he wants it to stop.

407
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.000
Isaac, do you remember
when Mummy found you?

408
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.040
How did that make you feel?

409
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.880
I don't know.

410
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.960
You know sometimes
we cry when we're happy

411
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.400
as well as when we're sad.

412
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.960
Is that why you cried,
because you were happy?

413
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.680
And do you remember
why you were happy?

414
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.600
She knew me.

415
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.040
[dogs barking]

416
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.840
What's in the sandwich?

417
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.720
Fish paste. [sighs]

418
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.760
Oh, it stinks.

419
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.920
- I've got extra.
- Oh.

420
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.880
Bella hates it, too.

421
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.040
Can't eat these at home.

422
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.840
Strictly a work meal.

423
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.120
What did she say about overtime?

424
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.040
What do you think?

425
00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.320
Ah, I'll pick up some flowers
from the garage.

426
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.720
Get myself back in the good books.

427
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.800
Should I do the same?

428
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.200
Dragging you out here?

429
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.520
Well, you hardly had
to twist my arm, did you?

430
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.640
That's somebody's little girl in there.

431
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.120
[sighs] She's 20.

432
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.320
Still a kid.

433
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.840
You never wanted any?

434
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.720
Kids, I mean.

435
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.560
We talked about it,

436
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.280
decided we had enough to worry about.

437
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.480
Happy just the two of us.

438
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.240
You?

439
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.280
[inhales] Maybe. One day.

440
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.400
Need to find someone first.

441
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.240
Maybe stop spending
your evenings like this.

442
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.920
[chuckles] This is the job.

443
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.840
[Nick] It's hardly
conducive to romance, is it?

444
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.800
Sitting in a car with some fat old duffer
eating fish paste sandwiches.

445
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.520
People probably think we're doggin'.

446
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.080
[Dhillon laughs]
Oh, for fuck's sake.

447
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.920
[Cheekbones]
Hey! What have I said?

448
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.600
Uh! Ah!

449
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.920
- Uh! Uh! Ow! Uh!
- Move!

450
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.560
[Dhillon] I'll call it in.

451
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.640
[tense music playing]

452
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.840
[Dhillon] Nick, wait!

453
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.360
This is Detective Ravi Dhillon,
we require immediate assistance

454
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.360
on Drakeford Lane, Matson Tower.

455
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.440
[tense music playing]

456
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.520
Hello?

457
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.680
Shit. Hello?

458
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.920
Hello?

459
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.840
If anyone can hear me,
there is an assault in progress...

460
00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.920
[tense music playing]

461
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.200
[crash]

462
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.400
- [Nick] Police!
- [man] Oh, for fuck sake!

463
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.280
- What is up with this...
- [man] Move, man, move, man.

464
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.840
- [Mia] Ow!
- Mia!

465
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.000
[Mia] What do you mean?
I haven't done anything.

466
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.840
- Mia!
- [Mia screams]

467
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.520
Mia!

Oh, you fuckin... [grunts]

471
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.880
Stay still, stay still!

472
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.640
Stay fuckin' still!

473
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.400
Still!

474
00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.560
Stay still, stay still!

475
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.080
- [groans]
- Get on your feet.

476
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.200
Get on your feet!

477
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.120
On your fuckin'...

478
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.080
So you like hitting little girls,
do you hey?

479
00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.280
Huh?

480
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.560
Do you like hitting little girls,
you fuck?

481
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.000
Move. Move!

482

Ah, you fuck!

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760
Fuck you, fuckin'!

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.040
C'mon, son!
Come on!

487
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.480
Let's see what you're made of, eh?

488
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.040

[groans] Fuck!

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.920
[man] Do you know
who the fuck we are?

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.320
- Get the fuck off me!
- You're under arrest.

500
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.000
- You're fucking dead!
- You don't have to say anything, but...

501
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.320
- Fuck off!
- Shut up!

502
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.800
- Fuck off!
- Shut the fuck up!

[thudding continues]

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.880
Hey stop it, stop, stop.

513
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.320
What's wrong?

514
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.600
Why were you doing that?

515
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.080
I don't know.

516
00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.320
Were you having a bad dream?

517
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.520
What were you dreaming about?

518
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.840
He thinks this is his home.

519
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.560
Who?

520
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.240
I'm cold.

521
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.240
Oh, darling.

522
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.040
I'm sorry. I'll turn the heating up.

523
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.360
Oh.

524
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.440
[sobs]

525
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.280
[whispering]
We're not supposed to be here.

526
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.560
[tense music playing]

527
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.880
[camera dings]

528
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.280
[Dhillon] We returned to the property
at approximately 10:30 pm

529
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.000
hoping to speak to Ms Thomas again.

530
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.280
This was when we observed
a domestic disturbance outside.

531
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.640
Her attacker
grabbed her by the hair,

532
00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.960
threw her against the wall,

533
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.200
dragged her inside.

534
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.520
No, I called it in.

535
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.680
DS Holness decided to...

536
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.360
...investigate the disturbance.

537
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.560
In my professional opinion
there was an assault in progress.

538
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.760
An assault in progress.
That's my professional opinion,

539
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.360
at which point my partner acted without
any concern for his own well-being.

540
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.000
As we were the only two officers
on the scene, I made a call.

541
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.840
- He entered the property unarmed.
- Unarmed.

542
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.280
At which point he was met
with extreme resistance

543
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.680
from armed gang members.

544
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.880
They came at me with a knife,

545
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.360
- I picked up a crowbar.
- A crowbar.

546
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.600
No, it's not that unusual.

547
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.560
These people often
stash weapons on the premises

548
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.200
in case they're raided by rival gangs.

549
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.840
[sighs]

550
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.600
I got lucky.

551
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.880
As I said,
it was reasonable force.

552
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.360
He made the right call.

553
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.400
<i>I shouldn't have hesitated.</i>

554
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.320
Are we done?

555
00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.800
[Lucy] Look, I know
she's been through a lot.

556
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.640
I just wanna ask some questions.

557
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.480
I won't be long.

558
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.000
Mia?

559
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.320
This lady's from social services.

560
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.280
Wants to talk to you.

561
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.320
You want a tea?

562
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.080
No, thank you,
I won't be a minute.

563
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.600
[indistinct narration on TV]

564
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.440
[Lucy] Hi, Mia.

565
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.520
[indistinct narration on TV]

566
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.680
How you feeling?

567
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.520
Must be nice to be back
with your mum.

568
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.360
I wanna talk to you about Aiden.

569
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.400
His mum said you were close.

570
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.280
I don't know where he is.
Don't bother asking.

571
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.080
You know what these people
are capable of.

572
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.760
He don't want your help.

573
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.560
Well... [sighs]

574
00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.680
neither did you.

575
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.920
Look, I'm giving you a chance

576
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.160
to do the right thing here.

577
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.320
But we are running out of time.
We need to find Aiden today

578
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.000
before the storm.

579
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.200
Erm...

580
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.280
Look, I know you're scared.

581
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.600
But you are safe now, Mia.

582
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.680
You can't promise that.

583
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.080
I can promise

584
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.160
that you are gonna regret
this tomorrow

585
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.880
when it's too late.

586
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.480
[exhales]

587
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.040
Okay. [sighs]

588
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.680
[Mia] Speed Kings.

589
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.320
There's an old go-kart track
on the Runford Estate.

590
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.080
If you're looking to score you go
and see the Speed Kings.

591
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.120
[sighs]

592
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.000
Pass me that brown one.

593
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.600
[clears throat]

594
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.880
[sniffs] What's that supposed to be?

595
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.440
It's liquorice.

596
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.920
Liquorice?

597
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.760
Who wants a liquorice candle?

598
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.880
I'll tell you who wants
a liquorice candle!

599
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.160
Mary Dean of 43 Abbots Road.

600
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.200
Well, there you go Mary Dean.

601
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.120
How many more of these
have we gotta do?

602
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.040
Four more orders,
then we'll start on dinner.

603
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.960
We?

604
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.760
- I'm missin' half a hand here.
- Rubbish.

605
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.000
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

606
00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.120
Pass me a lemon one.

607
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.400
Careful, you clumsy sod!

608
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.320
Wounded in the line of duty

609
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.080
and this is the thanks I get?

610
00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.360
I nearly died, you know.

611
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.760
Yeah, it does smell like lemon.

612
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520
Bella?

613
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.120
[sobbing and crying]

614
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.000
[Nick] I'm sorry.

615
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.920
[sobbing] You have to stop.

616
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.560
I know.

617
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.640
[sobbing]

618
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.480
[Mike] <i>So, uh, what time you back?</i>

619
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.000
Not late.
Uh, I'm not sure, sorry.

620
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.160
No, it's all right, I'm just...
I'm glad you came.

621
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.160
I brought this in case
you wanna read together

622
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.160
or just stick the telly on,
whatever you want.

623
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.640
No, this is... uh, this is great.

624
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.320
And I got you some ice cream
for after dinner.

625
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.560
- Oh.
- He only eats the strawberry.

626
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.160
- Don't ask me why.
- That's all right,

627
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.640
it means that Daddy can have
all the chocolate bit. Ah.

628
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.440
Mm, I ate the chocolate,
you can have the vanilla.

629
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.400
What?! Vanilla?

630
00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.400
- Boring.
- [chuckles]

631
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.080
He has been smiling on and off.

632
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.120
Tell him one of your shit jokes,
he'll like that.

633
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.920
Uh, mm,

634
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.880
I don't know any shit jokes.

635
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.280
I know lots of excellent jokes. [laughs]

636
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.440
You laugh at daddy's jokes, okay?

637
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.640
Bye, sweetheart.

638
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.680
Bye, sweetheart.

639
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.600
I'll see you later.

640
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.640
Mm. Uh, uh, just...

641
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.840
you like the new doctor don't you?

642
00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.480
Dr Bennett?
Yeah, she's great.

643
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.840
Yeah, erm...

644
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.040
I was thinking maybe
I could come along, get involved?

645
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.480
Yeah. I'd like that.

646
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.000
Cool, okay.

647
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.040
- Bye.
- Bye.

648
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.560
So...

649
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.160
do you wanna cook or shall I?

650
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.280
Thought so.

651
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.440
[clears throat]

652
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.360
Okay.

653
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.480

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.920
<i>that's what you said to me,
that night in the lanes.</i>

815
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.800
"I haven't killed you yet,"
that would make sense.

816
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.120
But you said,
"I haven't killed you before."

817
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.520
You should have listened.
I wish you'd listened.

818
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:28.120
I could have stopped the chaos,
but now you blame me.

819
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.760
You blame me because that's easier
than blaming yourself.

820
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.760
Blaming myself for what?

821
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.640
What happened after the storm.

822
00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.080
- [car door closes]
- [Aiden] That's all I got.

823
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.360
[sighs]

824
00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.640
[Mr A exhales]

825
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.800
Mia's place.

826
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.520
They're looking for you right? Police?

827
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.920
I dunno.

828
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.200
You see that makes me nervous

829
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.296
'cause we got three of ours in jail
right now, bruv,

830
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.120
so who you been talkin' to?

831
00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.160
Ain't a snitch.

832
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.560
Mia says you want off the line.
Is that right?

833
00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:28.840
- Man, I paid. I paid what I owe...
- I tell you what you fuckin' owe me!

834
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.560
What's that?

835
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.760
Nothin'.

836
00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.360
[Mr A] Show me.

837
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.320
You use this?

838
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.720
I could. Like, if I need to.

839
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.800
Look, you wanna come off the line,

840
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.616
- you gotta make it right with us, yeah?
- Yeah.

841
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.880
Can't fuckin' hear you!

842
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.720
Yeah, man.

843
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.360
I'll make it right.

844
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.856
Well, that's music to my fuckin' ears.

845
00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.520
You got a burner?

846
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.520
It's Tyler that brought you in, right?

847
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.416
You know that pig that fucked up his leg,
them locking him up like that,

848
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.960
[laughing] fucking police
brutality if you ask me.

849
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.800
Think they can do what they like,
no comebacks but...

850
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.760
...he don't know we got his name.

851
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.720
He don't know we got his fuckin' house.

852
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:39.520
So you, you're gonna make this right.

853
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.240
- [clicks]
- Okay.

854
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.640
Here you go.

855
00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.760
Is...

856
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.320
...that better?

857
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.280
If you get cold, you tell me

858
00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.000
and I can switch this on for you.

859
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.696
Oh, I hope you're not coming down
with something.

860
00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.520
- Do you feel okay?
- I'm cold.

861
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.560
I know sweetheart, I'm gonna
get you some blankets, hold on.

862
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.480
[phone vibrates]

863
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.880
Hey Rob, what's up?

864
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.400
Kate Stenner's issued
a formal complaint.

865
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.680
<i>- Says you assaulted her.</i>
- You're kidding?

866
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.880
[Rob] <i>I wish I was.</i>

867
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.160
Look, obviously I've given them
my side of the story but...

868
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.360
[sighs]...but they're gonna suspend you.

869
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.040
<i>Uh, pay you, I think,</i>

870
00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.336
<i>just until they get it straightened out.</i>

871
00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:42.440
[whispering] I saved her son's life
and she's got no idea.

872
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.320
[Rob] <i>What do you mean?</i>

873
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.600
Nothing.

874
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.360
Doesn't matter anymore.

875
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.360
Erm, thanks for telling me, Rob,
I appreciate it.

876
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.280
[Rob] <i>Look we'll talk tomorrow.</i>

877
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.520
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

878
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.440
[sighs] Yeah.

879
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.160
Uh, goodnight, Rob.

880
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.360
[sighs]

881
00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.640
Okay, let's get you tucked up and warm...

882
00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.200
Isaac, what you doing?
Don't do that, it's hot.

883
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.920
No, no, no, no, no,
sweetheart!

884
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.960
- I'm cold.
- Oh, my God.

885
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.760
[Isaac laughs]

886
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.760
Why are you laughing?

887
00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.360
It's not funny.
Isaac, why are you laughing?

888
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.640
[whispering] Two fish in a tank,
one says to the other,

889
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.280
"Do you know how to drive this thing?"

890
00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.240
[laughing]

891
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.680
[Bella] <i>That's hilarious.</i>

892
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.120
I'm serious.

893
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.400
You, write a book?

894
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.480
Takes you about two days
to write a bloody e-mail.

895
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.240
I've got stories, you know.

896
00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.240
- You've got pub stories.
- [Nick chuckles]

897
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.640
[Bella] Sorry, but you'll have to do
better than that.

898
00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.000
What about security?

899
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.880
Mm, they work nights
and it's dangerous.

900
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.920
Who knows.

901
00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.080
Maybe I'll be a bloody taxidermist.

902
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.560
[laughs]

903
00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.240
Mm, come here.

904
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:24.120
You know, you don't have to do anything.

905
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.240
I'm not old enough to retire.

906
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.000
And we'd have to take a hit
on the pension.

907
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.400
[vehicle approaching]

908
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.400
- Bella?
- Shh.

909
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.520
- What was that?
- What was what?

910
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.880
I don't know.

911
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.080
Did you lock the back door?

912
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.360
Probably.

913
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.760
Probably or definitely?

914
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.680
Yes. Now come on,

915
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.640
I'm tired, let's go to sleep.

916
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.640
[sighs]

917
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.440
I love you, Nick Holness.

918
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.400
I love you too.

919
00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.920
Mm.

920
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.920
[sighs]

921
