[police officer] Come down, son. No, no!

<i>Okay.</i>

175
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.240
<i>So you're saying that your entire defence</i>

176
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.000
<i>rests on your belief in what exactly?</i>

177
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.880
<i>- Reincarnation?
- Recurrence.</i>

<i>Same body. The same life.</i>

179

it's an explanation. It's the truth.</i>

180
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.640
Well, thank you for clarifying.
That's very helpful.

181
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.040
[Gideon] Please don't.

182
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.080
You want to submit me
for a physiological evaluation,

183
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.680
that would be a mistake.

184
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.160
When I walked in here tonight,
you told me we'd already met.

185
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.040
Was that in this lifetime or another?

186
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.800
If it was this lifetime,
you would have remembered me.

187
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.440
So all this has happened before?

188
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.240
No, not exactly.

189
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.240
- Lucy?
- You change things?

190
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.040
So you're saying
that's how you manage to survive.

191
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.920
Because you know
what's going to happen next?

192
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.760
For the most part.

193
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.240
I only hide where I won't be found.

194
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.840
I only steal when I won't be caught.

We searched your place by the tracks.

197

Found cash.

198
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.320
Thirteen thousand pounds give or take.

199
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.000
- Was that stolen?
- No.

200
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.080
Once I can pass for 18.
I don't need to steal anymore.

201
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200
And why is that?

202

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.880
I'm taking you somewhere to hide.

326
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.120
Somewhere safe.

327
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.080
Where no one will hurt you.

328
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.360
You can trust me, Jonah.

329
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.440
I know you don't know me,
but I'm a good person.

330
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.680
I am a good person.

[dramatic music playing]

332
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.120
[Gideon] You'll never find him.

333
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.680
[Dhillon] A little louder, Mr Shepherd.

334
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.640
You'll never find him.

335
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.440
On Tuesday, the third of February 2009.

336
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.080
you drove to a house in Stevenport
where you abducted Jonah Edward Taylor

337
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.000
while he was playing in his back garden.

338
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.480
You say you're saving people.

339
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.720
Tell us how you saved him.

340
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.640
It's hard to do a good thing
when people call you a monster.

341
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.680
When you're the only one who understands
that the world is full of monsters.

342
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.640
<i>They just never look like
you imagine them.</i>

343
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.600
<i>Jonah Taylor's parents
were going to kill him</i>

344
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.440
<i>and bury him in a shallow grave.</i>

345
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.280
Where did you take him?

346
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.760
I left him with someone I trust.

347
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.160
She keeps him safe.

348
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.440
Takes care of him.

349
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.680
Why?

350
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.480
Why would she harbour a kidnapped child

351
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.600
when she knows the whole country
is looking for him?

352
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.080
[Gideon] I explain what will happen
if he goes home.

353
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.680
And she believes you?

354
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.280
- [Gideon] She does.
- Why?

355
00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.000
Because I woke her up.

356
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.440
The lives we lead
are like tracks in the snow,

357
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.680
and when we live them again,

358
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.800
we're walking in the tracks
we left before.

359
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.520
But if your path changes,
there are no tracks.

360
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.080
And living is like wading
through thick powder,

361
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.560
some people find it hard.

362
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.000
<i>Evelyn was supposed to die in a car crash</i>

363
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.520
<i>on the 5th of September 1977.
but she didn't.</i>

364
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.480
Her family moved on,

365
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.640
but Evelyn,

366
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.560
she could sense something was different.

367
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.320
<i>Part of her would always remember
that crash.</i>

368
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.440
<i>She started seeing things
that weren't there.</i>

369
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.320
<i>Different patterns in the wallpaper.</i>

370
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.160
<i>Shadows without weight
passing across the room.</i>

371
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.320
<i>And people.</i>

372
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.920
<i>Ghosts...</i>

373
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.680
<i>...drifting in and out of her reality.</i>

374
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.560
<i>Here one minute,</i>

375
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.160
<i>gone the next.</i>

376
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.520
I realised that she was seeing
the world as it was before.

377
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.800
The tracks that others left behind.

378
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.480
Every change causes ripples,

379
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.160
and those ripples followed her
wherever she went.

380
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.880
When she was 19 she checked herself
into a psychiatric hospital.

381
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.040
I got her out.

382
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.280
I helped her come to terms
with the glitches in her reality.

383
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.840
We found her an old house on the moor
where the ripples wouldn't find her,

384
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.360
and in time she was able
to make sense of her memories.

385
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.400
So she's like you?

386
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.240
In a lot of ways, yes.

387
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.240
In every new lifetime,
her memories return,

388
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.400
<i>so she knows what she has to do.</i>

389

[tyre hissing]

390
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.520
But she never could stand the ripples.

391
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.520
That's why she always moves
to that same house,

392
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.600
to get away from the world.

393
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.000
To create familiar patterns
and repeat them.

394
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.920
No ghosts.

395
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.640
No shadows.

396
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.080
Just the company of a little lost boy.

397
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320
Where's the house?

398
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.000
You'll never find it.

399
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.720
You never have.

400
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.600
You enjoy it, don't you?

No, because when your friend waged war

One day.

Punctuation? That's how you see it?

That's how you justify the killing?

445

There is no justification.

Why not just kill him?

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.840
Whatever I do, wherever I go,

489
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.360
someone always finds me eventually,
and it's always the same detective.

490
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.040
Maybe I should ask for a raise?

491
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.920
Yeah, maybe you should.

492
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.280
If we always end up here
then you've told me this story before.

493
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360
Yeah, I have.

494
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.800
- [Dhillon] And have I ever believed you?
- No, you haven't.

495
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.280
Then why bother telling it again?

496
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.200
Because I'm not trying to convince you,
Detective Dhillon.

497
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.400
Lucy, I'm telling the truth.

498
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.800
And I can prove it to you.

499
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.640
You can prove it to yourself.

500
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.680
It's one question.

501
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.400
Lucy, think... hard.

502
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.120
What's the worst thing
you've ever experienced?

503
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.680
I stayed alive for you.

504
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.320
Incarcerated.

505
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.040
Alone for 25 years

506
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.400
waiting for you to come back.

507
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.280
[distorted] It was the longest
25 years I've ever lived.

508
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.640
[indistinct chatter]

509
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.200
[buzzer buzzing]

510
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.480
[Gideon] <i>They made me
share a cell with some animal</i>

511
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.640
<i>who murdered his wife and kid.</i>

512
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.520
<i>Said it wasn't his fault.</i>

513
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.800
<i>Drinking gave him a temper.</i>

514
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.040
<i>A temper.</i>

515
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.600
What the fuck are you looking at?

516
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.320
[Gideon] <i>I added his name to the list.</i>

517
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.920
<i>I added a lot of names.</i>

518
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.600
It's not hard for me to reset,

519
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.080
all I need is a piece glass
or a razor blade.

520
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.760
But I resisted. I suffered prison for you.

521
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.200
[echoing]
Now I need you to do something for me.

522
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.320
Remember, Lucy, remember!

523
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.880
[whispering] And answer the question.

524
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.920
[distorted] What's the worst thing
you've ever experienced?

525
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.640
[gunshot]

526
00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360
[gasps]

527
00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.840
Mummy?

528
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.680
[breathes heavily]

529
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
[gasps]

530
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.800
- [breathes heavily]
- Lucy? What's wrong?

531
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.880
No, she didn't,
she's not... she's not...

532
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
[Gideon] I changed it.

533
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.600
- I stopped it.
- Sit down!

534
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.760
You told me the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

535
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.320
and 30 years ago I stopped it.

536
00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.760
I broke into your house,

537
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.600
<i>I removed the firing pin</i>

538
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.800
<i>from your grandfather's old shotgun.</i>

539
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.400
<i>Your mother pulled the trigger.</i>

540
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.840
<i>She reached the brink...</i>

541
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.280
<i>...but you got a second chance.</i>

542
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.840
Argh!

543
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.800
After that,
you lead a very different life.

544
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.960
- Lucy, we need to go.
- Give her a minute.

545
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.480
[shouting] Shut up!

546
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.760
Come on.

547
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.016
You're not supposed to be here.

548
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.136
[Gideon] You're not supposed to be
a lot of things.

549
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.360
This isn't your life.

550
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.440
Sorry.

551
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.160
[Dhillon] Lucy?

552
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.440
[shouting] Open the door!

553
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.960
Lucy! Open the door!

554
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.280
[breathes heavily]

555
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.840
You said my life was different,
different to what?

556
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.960
Every life you've ever led.

557
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.160
- You're making new tracks now.
- How so?

558
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.520
I can help you remember,

559
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.496
but you'll only wake up
if you get there on your own.

560
00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.440
And we've got to wake you up, Lucy,
we got to, because I made a promise.

561
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.000
The last time we met
you asked me to do this.

562
00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.040
We didn't realise how different your life
was going to be.

563
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.640
You're not who you were.

564
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.520
But I was married...

565
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.760
- ...to Mike?
- No.

566
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.640
So, Isaac?

567
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.840
He's not supposed to be here.

568
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.880
That's why you tried to take him away.

569
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.800
No. No, no, no. I didn't. I didn't.

570
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.280
I didn't. Lucy, no, I didn't.

571
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.640
- Give me your shoelace.
- What?

572
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.880
Please. Please,
just give me your shoelace. Please!

573
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.280
[Dhillon] Lucy, don't.

574
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.080
<i>I just...
I just want to show you something.</i>

575
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.160
<i>I'm not going to strangle you with it.
Please!</i>

576
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.920
Every knot is the end of one lifetime

577
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.560
and the beginning of the next.

578
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.520
Now, I used to think
it was a straight line.

579
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.560
You live, you die.

580
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.000
You live, you die.

581
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.200
That's how I experience it.

582
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.040
But I wasn't seeing the whole picture.

583
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.120
What if, when we start a new loop,

584
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.280
that's exactly what it is?

585
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.160
A loop.

586
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.560
It's a new life,
but it's passing along the same curve.

587
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.200
I can remember my previous lives.

588
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.160
They're in my past,

589
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.760
but they're also happening in my present.

590
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.640
Simultaneous, parallel.

591
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.520
And now these loops,

592
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.360
they're so tightly wound
that they're almost touching.

593
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.160
- [gasps]
- [tyre screech]

594
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.640
[Gideon] <i>So that's why we glimpse
the world as it was before.</i>

595
00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.640
<i>You wake in the night
to the sound of a shot that never fired.</i>

596
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.160
<i>You see the things
that were and the things that weren't.</i>

597
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.640
<i>You were never supposed to live
in that house, Lucy.</i>

598
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.400
<i>Neither was Isaac.</i>

599
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.040
But Isaac isn't like us.

600
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.440
<i>He's not bound to this lifetime.</i>

601
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.320
<i>Where you can see the echoes
of previous loops,</i>

602
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.600
<i>Isaac can reach out and touch them.</i>

603
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.200
<i>Talk to them.</i>

604
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.200
<i>But sometimes he loses his balance</i>

605
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.640
<i>and he slips from one lifetime</i>

606
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.640
into another and disappears
from our world altogether.

607
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.120
But why? Why Isaac?

608
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.000
Because he's an anomaly, Lucy.

609
00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.440
He's not supposed to exist.

610
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.000
[ominous music playing]

611
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.880
[door opens]

612
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.440
[sighs]

613
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.480
Do you want me to turn that on for you?

614
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.080
Or not.

615
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.640
Just carry on staring into space.

616
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.920
[sighs]

617
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Come here.

618
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.080
Come here. I want to tell you a story.

619
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.120
Your mum says you like stories.

620
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.680
[burps]

621
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.080
Once upon a time I was
having dinner with a girl called Sonia.

622
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.120
All right, she's pretty.

623
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.320
Boring as hell.
Zero sense of humour.

624
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.400
You'd have liked her.

625
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.600
Anyway, about halfway through the meal...

626
00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.320
...I heard this amazing laugh.

627
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.840
This woman was drinking
with her friends and she was laughing

628
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.280
<i>so hard that she had piña colada
coming out her nose.</i>

629
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.080
Do you know what piña colada is?

630
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.280
People drink it in the sunshine.

631
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.160
I mean, it was raining outside
but she didn't care. She just...

632
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.080
<i>...wanted a drink
with an umbrella in it...</i>

633
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.840
...'cause it was fun.

634
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.040
Sonia went home in a taxi,

635
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.800
but I stayed and I spoke to the lady
with the piña colada.

636
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.040
And six months later, I married her...

637
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.360
...and then for the next three years

638
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.200
we laughed together.

639
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.000
And they're the happiest years of my life.

640
00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.480
And then...

641
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.120
...you came along and it was over.

642
00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.640
No more piña coladas, no more laughing.

643
00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.600
You destroyed our lives.

644
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.920
Do you know that?

645
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.680
Do you even feel anything?

646
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.400
It's like there's no one in there.

647
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.320
