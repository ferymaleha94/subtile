I'm gonna need a recent photo of Isaac.

Clear, high res.

[Mike] Why?

[Ravi] If we keep the story
focused on Isaac,

when you're ready for your pudding.

- What's for pudding?
- [Ellen] Apple crumble.

So tell me, what am I missing?

No real link between the victims.

Case could be ten years old at least.

There's no pattern, Nick. It's just chaos.

304
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.120
I just got in the car and drove.

305
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.280
That's okay, it's okay.

306
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.400
You have to trust the police, okay?

307
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.760
And honestly, the best thing
you can do for Isaac right now

308
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.960
is to take care of yourself
so you can be there for him if he...

309
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.440
If they find him.

310
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.600
When.

311
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.040
Oh, um, I know something.

312
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.520
Harold Slade, I... I...

313
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.080
I read his name in the paper
and I remembered it.

314
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.880
I know that that name
means something to me.

315
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.000
Or maybe you just want it
to mean something.

316
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.400
Please don't do that.
I didn't come here for therapy.

317
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.320
[Dr Bennett] So why are you here then?

318
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.720
You want the name Slade
to mean something so you can act.

319
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.400
You can help.

320
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.040
Being powerless in all of this
that... that is the scariest thing.

321
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.440
When you heard Slade's name,
you wanted to feel a connection.

322
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.920
But it's... it's more likely just déjà vu.

323

We have two ears, two eyes,
a right brain and a left brain.

processes information

325
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.760
faster than the other.

326
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.560
We are experiencing
and remembering the moment

327
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.560
at the same time.

328
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.920
Which is why we sometimes feel like
we've done something before,

329
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.240
or we think we recognize a stranger.

330
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.240
Harold Slade has a violin
above his stairs in the hallway,

331
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.440
so which side of my brain
is telling me that?

332
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.520
It could have been something
you overheard,

333
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.760
or saw on the news,
or maybe something the police told you.

334
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800
I...

335
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.280
[Dr Bennett] Maybe it was another memory

336
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.520
that you have linked
with the idea of Harold Slade.

337
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.320
I know him.

338
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.000
I know that I know him.
I have to tell the police.

339
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.400
[Dr Bennett] Tell them what?

340
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.920
Lucy, what do you think they're gonna say?

341

342
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.440
[Dr Bennett] Have you slept?

343
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.920
Uh...

344
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.960
[Dr Bennett] You need to go home and rest.

345
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.560
I'm here if you need me
and anything I can do to help.

346
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.560
Temazepam?

347
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.440
Sorry?

348
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.320
A few years ago,
I had a prescription for temazepam,

349
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.976
but it didn't, um...
didn't stop me waking up.

350
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.960
But it... it... it helped me
settle down again.

351
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.280
You're right. I, um...

352
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.560
I really need sleep.

353
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.080
I need to clear my head.

354
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.880
Temazepam won't help clear your head,
trust me.

355
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.560
Oh, you said you could help me.

356
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.320
So help me.

357

[Nick] Serial killer, serial fly tipper.

It's a gateway crime.

364
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.080
See, first off,
you dump a washing machine in some woods.

365
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.456
Then you stab a couple of people.

366
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.920
And the next thing you know
you're... you're snatching kids.

367
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.320
Sorry.

368
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.640
I might have been wrong before
when I said there was no link.

369
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.640
What if there is?

370
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.160

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.880
- Yeah.
- Isaac's mother, obviously.

374
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.080
Her name was written
on the suspect's wall.

375
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.416
And she might have known Harold Slade.

376
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.440
Oh, she doesn't know what she knows.

377
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.320
She's unstable as you would be.

378
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.920
But if she does, if there is a link
then she connects every victim.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.960
We couldn't make the funeral so I just...

492
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.480
I just wanted to pay my respects.

493
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.280
What's your son's name?

494
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.400
Isaac.

495
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.280
Isaac, and he's in the rowing club?

496
00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.360
He was, he used to be.

497
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.280
- We moved.
- [Mrs Slade] Really?

498
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.000
- When was that?
- Last year.

[clears throat]

500
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.160
This is really embarrassing
could I use your loo?

501
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.640
Uh, yes, I... I suppose so.

502
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.136
- Sorry.
- [Mrs Slade] That's all right.

503
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.520
Um, upstairs third on the right.

504
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.680
Okay.

[Nick] Dogs name was Milo, a Doberman.

514
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.880
Forensics tell us
he was probably run over.

515
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.976
We've contacted the owners,
they don't know anything

516
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.480
just that he's been missing
for a few days.

517
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.160
Other than that
nothing out of the ordinary.

518
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.160
As you know we impounded the Nissan
over two weeks ago

with a flat tyre and a buckled wheel.

520
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.360
We have to assume the suspect
has another means of transport.

521
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.880
So, first priority

522
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.480
is to identify the new car
so that we can track it down.

[cell phone vibrating]

[Nick] We've hidden some cameras
in the woods where the dog was found.

525
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.600
Working theory is he comes and goes,
so he'll be back.

[Ravi] <i>Miss Chambers.</i>

to buy a... a property near here.

531
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.120
I'm gonna send you
some pictures, um, documents.

532
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.480

I knew the code 1812.

536
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.120
It was 1812 like the overture.

537
00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.440
I'm sorry I'm not sure
what you're telling me.

538
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.040
He should have killed himself.

539
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.480
Who, who should have killed himself?

540
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.160
Slade had secrets.

Miss Chambers, I need you
to stay away from that house.

Have you got the address?
Read it back to me.

- Good. All right. I'm heading there now.
- No you're not.

550
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.920
Listen to me, you need to take a breath,

551
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.896
- go home and let us do our jobs.
- [disconnect tone]

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.120
What? What do you mean? Where is she?

557
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.400
Oh, fuck.

558
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.880
Not today.

559
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960
Fuck it.

560
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.320
Ellen, listen to me.

561
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.680
No, you don't need to call the police...

562
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.800
...because I know where she's going.

Oh, God, you're freezing.

We need to get you back, okay?

- Will you come with me?
- Mm?

Oh, God, I can't do this today, I can't!

570
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.640
If you can't stay put
you will have to live somewhere else.

Do you understand?

572
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.360
I'm not chasing you up here again.

573
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.760
You look like my daughter.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.040
Yeah, I know.

576
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
You were the one on the telly.

577
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.560
Talking about those girls.

578
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.160
Mum, please, please
let's go back to the car.

...you must be a very good person.

581
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.560
Will you sit with me?

What's wrong?

592
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.320
You can tell me.

593

Oh, somebody took Isaac away.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.440
He's gone.

It's okay, you'll find him.

You haven't given up.

601
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.160
That's what you said, on the telly.

602
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.800
You remember, don't you?

603
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.160
I've never been on the telly, Mum.

604
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.160
I don't want to go.

605
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.760
I know.

606
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.640
But we have to.

607
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.640
I'm sorry.

608
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.760
Ready?

609
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.560
I can do it.

610
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.440
Right, let's get you warmed up.

Oh, that's lovely.

Well, it's a fixer upper.

616

Could be nice.

Gut it, do it up.

If you got the time and the money
you could turn the profit.

Doesn't explain the fake name of course.

620

If this was Slade's,
no one knew about it, not even the wife.

I've got pictures of the deeds.

622

If we tie this to the case we can get...

...a warrant.

624
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.760

Could be an imminent risk.

628
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.760
Reasonable grounds.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.640

[Nick] No.

Just a couple of rats.

It's a common misconception.
