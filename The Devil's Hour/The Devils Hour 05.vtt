00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.120
We told the police but they said
there was nothing to go on.

330
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.000
Was it a red Nissan?

331
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.240
- How do you know that?
- [Dhillon] Lucky guess.

332
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.400
When's the last time you heard from him?

333
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.760
My birthday.

334
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.920
When was your birthday?

335
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.400
Three weeks ago.

336
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.000
[Dhillon] 1:23 AM?

337
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.416
He only ever calls
in the middle of the night

338
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.760
because he knows I won't answer.

339
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.000
[Gideon on speaker] <i>Hi, pal.</i>

340
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.000
<i>I don't know if you even listen
to these messages,</i>

341
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.840
<i>I must've left you a hundred by now.</i>

342
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.440
<i>I don't know if you'll hear
from me next year.</i>

343
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.400
I hope so.

344
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.440
I hope one day you'll pick up the phone
and talk to me.

345
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.920
<i>Tell me that you understand.</i>

346
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.520
<i>But I know you never will.</i>

347
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.720
<i>It looks like you've got a good life and
that's... that's... good enough for me.</i>

348
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.040
That's why I did it.

349
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.440
So you could live.

350
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.760
You were the first one I saved.

351
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.280
<i>If you are listening,
then happy birthday,</i>

352
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.000
<i>enjoy 58.</i>

353
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.040
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

354
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.920
I'm gonna need to hear that again.

355
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.640
[Isaac] Hello?

356
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.440
Isaac.

357
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.800
Waiting for my mummy.

358
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.880
Ms Rogers.

359
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.720
We can't go outside on our own.

360
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680
Isaac?

361
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.240
Who are you talking to?

362
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.600
The man with the glasses.

363
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.080
- [knocks on door]
- [Mike] Knock, knock.

364
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.440
Hello?

365
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.160
Er, Mike.

366
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.000
Isaac's dad.

367
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.720
Oh. Right. sorry.

368
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.880
I'm Ms Rogers.

369
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Yeah. His mum asked me
to come pick him up.

370
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.960
She said that she called the office.

371
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.520
Did she?

372
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.280
Let me just check that.
They probably sent an email.

373
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.976
Sorry. I know it's awkward,
but it's policy.

374
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.440
Yeah, that's... I understand.

375
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.120
[Elena] Ah, here we go. Mike. Sorry.

376
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.320
- Can you confirm your surname?
- Stevens.

377
00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.240
[Elena] That's the one.
Sorry about that. Had to be sure.

378
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.760
It's no problem.

379
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.040
Will Isaac's mum be dropping him off
in the morning?

380
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.360
It's just I'd like a word.

381
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.120
You can talk to me, if it's about him.

382
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.320
It is.

383
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.920
It's nothing,

384
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.800
just that he's been drifting more.

385
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.720
I know that's understandable
after what happened but it's...

386
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
it's... [sighs]

387
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.560
He freaks you out, don't he?

388
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.120
No. God, no. I'm not saying that.

389
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.840
No. But he has been having conversations.

390
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.736
- [Mike] Uh-hmm.
- Talking to people who aren't there.

391
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.400
Yeah. Yeah. He does that, yeah.

392
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.520
Yeah, Lucy's mum's got schizophrenia,
for what it's worth.

393
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.736
Of course, that don't explain
why he can't feel any pain.

394
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.880
You know, he burnt his hand?

395
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.040
- Uh-hmm.
- Yeah?

396
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.040
Apparently, you're not allowed
to call a child a psychopath.

397
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120
That's what I read.

398
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.280
Neurodiversity can be hard to diagnose
at a young age.

399
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.640
Neurodiversity?

400
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.960
Ah. Well, I guess we'll just...

401
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.000
...see what happens
when he gets older, eh?

402
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.240
He may surprise you.

403
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.760
Or murder me in my sleep.

404
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.240
Sorry. That's... that was a bad joke.

405
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.400
Erm, nice to meet you, Ms Rogers.

406
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.240
Yeah. Yeah. You too.

407

[whistles]

408
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.240
Could you send me that recording?

[sighs]

410
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.520
I really can't.

411
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.680
It's evidence.

412
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.520
Are you serious?

413
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.240
I could be in a lot of trouble already.

414
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.280
[Lucy] Well, can I listen to it
one last time?

415
00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.360

- Maybe.
- No. I used to live by a train line.

428
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.600
Trust me, I know that sound.

429
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.120
So he's by the tracks.

430
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.376
Doesn't exactly narrow it down.

431
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.520
No. There's not many places
a train sounds its horn.

432
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.600
Tunnels, level crossings.

433
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.240
If we assume he's still in the area, say,

434
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.200
a hundred mile radius,

435
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.320
not many trains passing those points
at 1:23 in the morning,

436
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.000
give or take a couple of minutes.

437
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.600
It's worth a try, I guess.

438
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.640
All we need is a railway map
and a train schedule.

439
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.456
That's some good work, Detective Chambers.

[Lucy] Hello?

Hey.

[sighs]

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.880
Having fun?

450
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.600
Yeah. Learned all about football,
haven't you, mate?

451
00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880
Hey.

452
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.920
Cuddle for Mummy.

453
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.680
Where were you?

454
00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.200
Lost track of time. Sorry.

455
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.920
[Mike] Yeah? Lost, er,
lost track of time where?

456
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.800
Just had some errands to run.

457
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.480
What does it matter?

458
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.640
It doesn't. Why is it secret?

459
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.640
It's not a secret.
I just don't want to tell you.

460
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.360
That's what a secret is.

461
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.200
[Lucy] Has Isaac had dinner?

462
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.080
Er, yes, yes.

463
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.760
Eaten like a prince, this boy.

464
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.520
He's had sausage pasta,
just like we used to make.

465
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.000
There's, erm, there's some left
in the pot if you want some.

466
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.720
Yeah. And then I gave him some ice cream.

467
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.280
Hope that's okay.

468
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.080
We don't have any ice cream.

469
00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.280
Er, I bought him
some strawberry ice cream.

470
00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.120
That's his favourite, is that right?

471
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.920
What?

472
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.560
I was in Cheltenham.

473
00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.880
In Cheltenham?

474
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.560
With Ravi... DI Dhillon. We...

475
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.000
...er, we're working
on something together.

476
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.560
You... you're working on something
with the police?

477
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.760
The man that took Isaac...

478
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.720
...is called Gideon Shepherd.

479
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.400
We spoke with his brother today.

480
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.640
I'm sorry. What?

481
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.920
He gave us a lead.

482
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.360
A lead?

483
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.800
Lucy, this guy's... this guy...
this guy's a serial killer.

What are you thinking?

485
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.680
I'm thinking I need this to end.

486
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.120
- I need it to be over.
- It is over.

Nothing.

that would make this better.

Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

Can you do that? Can you make it normal?

That's why I love you.

But if that's what you want,

502

I will try.

this is the man that murdered
Shane Fisher and Harold Slade.

Okay. I'll pass it up to MCS.

So it gets buried in someone's in-tray?

[alarm buzzes]

655
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.840
Are you gonna sit down?

656
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.280
[chuckles]

657
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.280
What's funny?

658
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.080
Nothing. Sorry. Nothing.

659
00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.880
You ever been in this room before?

660
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.120
No.

661
00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.400
But you feel like you have?

662
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.200
Why would I?

663
00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.120
Déjà vu.

664
00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.360
They say it's like a short circuit
in the brain.

665
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.640
Your sense of a moment plays
through your memory centre.

666
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.400
<i>Makes you feel
like you've experienced all this before.</i>

667
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.920
[dramatic music playing]

668
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.360
Jesus.

669
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.920
What the fuck do you want?

670
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.520
[Gideon] <i>You should have listened.</i>

671
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.280
<i>I wish you'd listened.</i>

672
00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.080
<i>I could have stopped the chaos.</i>

673
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.760
But now you blame me.

674
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.400
You blame me because that's easier
than blaming yourself.

675
00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.600
Blaming myself for what?

676
00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.280
What happened after the storm.

677
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.080
I never met your partner
but I read his obituary.

678
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.280
He seemed like a good man.

679
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.360
I'm not trying to goad you.

680
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.520
We all have people we care about.

681
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.640
Who do you care about?

682
00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.960
Your brother maybe?

683
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.800
We spoke to Malcolm. Did you know that?

684
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.200
He seems like a good man too.
Makes me wonder how you ended up this way.

685
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.600
Same upbringing, same mother, same father.

686
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.440
[Dhillon] You left your brother messages.

687
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.560
Malcolm's got nothing to do with this.

688
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.976
You leave him alone. You understand?

689
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.880
- You leave him alone.
- [Dhillon] You said you did it for him.

690
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.880
Was Malcolm the reason
you murdered your father?

691
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.240
My father was the reason
I murdered my father.

692
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.576
[Dhillon] Did he do something to Malcolm?

693
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.216
- Did he hurt him? Was he cruel?
- You've got absolutely no fucking idea...

694
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.976
- ...what you are talking about?
- [Dhillon] Why did you murder him, Gideon?

695
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.080
Because he murdered me first.

696
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.360
What did you say?

697
00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.200
[suspenseful music playing]

698
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.280
All right.

699
00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.880
You might want to record this.

700
00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.640
