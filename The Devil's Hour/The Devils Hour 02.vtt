658
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.160
Because her name's Lucy Chambers.

659
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.920
[telephone ringing]

660
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.480
[ringing continues]

661
00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.960
I hope it goes without saying
we take bullying very seriously.

662
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.560
[Lucy] This isn't bullying,
this is assault.

663
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.616
We've spoken to some of the boys
in year six and we...

664
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.840
Year six.

665
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.840
You're telling me
a year six did this to him?

666
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.960
Well, they're saying he did it to himself.

667
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.800
- [Lucy] What?
- Isaac is very impressionable.

668
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.480
The other children were seeing
how far they could push it.

669
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.656
- I don't...
- [Miss Jones] One of them told Isaac

670
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.440
to hit himself, and he did.

671
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.400
Who told you that?

672
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.640
Isaac did.

673
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.000
I want them gone.

674
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.920
Mrs. Chambers.

675
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.840
If some sick little prick
thinks it's funny to coax a child

676
00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.120
into hitting himself...

677
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.240
I can assure you,
no one is taking this lightly.

678
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.920
We're trying to ascertain what happened.

679
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.400
You know what happened.
Isaac doesn't lie.

680
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.120
We spoke to the other boy.

681
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.080
And he's denying it.

682
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.800
No, you don't understand,
Isaac doesn't lie.

683
00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.240
- He doesn't know how.
- He does have a very vivid imagination.

684
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.160
Are you saying he made it up?

685
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.600
We're saying we need to make sure we have
all the facts before we take action.

686
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.080
Has Isaac ever hurt himself before?

687
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.840
No.

688
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.800
I'm sure you'll appreciate
there are steps we need to take

689
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.896
when a child is self-harming.

690
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.560
This isn't self-harm.
He didn't do this because he wanted to.

691
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.760
He did it because someone told him to.

692
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.280
Because there is something wrong.

693
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.480
- The EA have conducted...
- What's the EA got to do with it?

694
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.200
I'm not talking about special needs.

695
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.760
Christ, I have been to every psychiatrist
in the county.

696
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.240
I know he doesn't have special needs.

697
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.280
But not one of them can tell me
why my son doesn't laugh or cry

698
00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.560
or why he won't so much
as hug me unless I tell him to.

699
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.120
People...

700
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.960
[sniffs]

701
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.640
People self-harm because they are angry
or upset.

702
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.280
Or guilty.

703
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.800
But he doesn't feel those
things, he can't feel anything

704
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.880
because he's broken, something's just...

705
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.720
broken and I don't know how to fix it.

706
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.360
[sobs]

707
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.000
Um, [sniffs] if you can't look after him,
I'll find somewhere else.

708
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.600
[indistinct chatter]

709
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.600
[man] Excuse me.

710
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.720
[woman] Hang on.

711
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.760
Mark?

712
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.520
Why's this sitting on your desk?

713
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.000
- What's that?
- What is it?

714
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.720
It's Lynn's report on the Weber case.
Just sitting there.

715
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.856
We're trying to arrange a CPC

716
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.280
and it's just lying around
on your lunchbox, sort it out.

717
00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.280
Ah, Christ.

718
00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.120
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

719
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.800
I'm DI Dhillon, this is DS Hollis.

720
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.920
- We're looking for Lucy Chambers.
- She's not here at the minute.

721
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.296
[Ravi] Do you know when she's coming back?

722
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.896
No idea, she's probably out on a visit,
you'll need to speak to Rob.

723
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.960
- Which one's Rob?
- [Karen] He's in a meeting.

724
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.640
Any idea when he'll be out?

725
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.080
[Karen] You're welcome to wait.

726
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.480
- [Ravi] Is this her?
- Yes, the one in the middle, yeah.

727
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.000
- Good guess.
- It's not a guess.

728
00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.840
- Remember the drawings from Lodge 13?
- [Nick] Yeah?

729
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.360
This is her, Nick.

730
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.560
I need you to give me
her mobile number, right now.

731
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.560
Please?

732
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.560
[ominous music playing]

733
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040
[car engine turns off]

734
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.960
Does it hurt?

735
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.080
It's okay to cry.

736
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.440
If it hurts,
sometimes crying makes it better.

737
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.800
[sighs]

738
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.400
Come here.

739
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.760
I won't give up, okay?

740
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.320
I love you so, so much.

741
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.480
I love you so, so much.

742
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040
Come on.

743
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.560
Okay. What do you want for dinner?

744
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.800
I think we've got
chicken nuggets in the freeze...

745
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.080
Wait there.

746
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.280
Wait here, do you understand?

747
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.280
[glass crunching]

[ominous music playing]

750
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.520
- Lucy.
- [screams]

751
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.840
Oh! Sorry. I've broke your glass.

752
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.920
Mike.

753
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.080
So, you weren't here, so I just...

754
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.400
So you thought you'd just let yourself in?
[exhales]

755
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.400
- I needed a wee.
- Oh, fuck's sake, Mike.

756
00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.960
Lucy, I, I really need to talk to you
about something.

757
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.760
- Um...
- [pants]

758
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.760
Aren't you gonna say,
"Hello" to your son?

759
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.640
Hello, Isaac.

760
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.800
Do... do you, uh, remember me?

761
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.160
Of course he remembers you, Mike,

762
00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.560
it's only been a few months,
he's not simple.

763
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.880
What happened to his face?

764
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.520
Kids at school.

765
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.760
[sighs]
You can't be here.

766
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.360
Look, just, just, just listen
to what I have to say,

767
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.920
and then, I'll go.

768
00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.320
- [groans]
- [Mike mumbles]

769
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.640
Uh, Isaac, go and play in the other room.

770
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.400
He plays now?

771
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.120
You scared the shit out of me, Mike.

772
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.600
Have you...

773
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.920
Have you been vaping in here?

774
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.760
What? No. I gave up.

775
00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.960
[sniffs]

776
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.960
Um, oh, why are you here, exactly?

777
00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.040
Um...

778
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.000
[inhales]

779
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.520
Ah, I've been seeing someone.

780
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.800
Okay.

781
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.320
[Mike] She doesn't know about you.

782
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.760
I mean she, she knows that I'm,
I'm still married but...

783
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.400
...she doesn't know that we're still...

784
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.160
She wants to make it...

785
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.240
...serious, official.

786
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.960
[sighs] I'm sorry,
I know that I should've...

787
00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.600
...told you about this before.

788
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.400
So this is why you broke into my house?
[laughs]

789
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.080
I didn't break in.

790
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.640
Who is this serious,

791
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.880
official woman, does she have a name?

792
00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.680
Uh, uh-huh. Um, Harriet.

793
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.640
Harriet Badcock.

794
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.560
[chuckles]

795
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.880
- Really?
- [laughing] Sorry.

796
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.800
That's not a real name. [laughs]

797
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.760
Look. Whatever. I just...
I thought that you deserved to know.

798
00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.680
I didn't want you to find out
on Facebook or...

799
00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.400
Not on Facebook, so.

800
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.800
Harriet. Badcock.

801
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.720
[exhales]

802
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.960
You know, she only wants you
for your surname, right?

803
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.160
- We're not getting married.
- Not yet.

804
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.160
[Mike] No, not ever.

805
00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.960
Luce, I don't want her.

806
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.000
- She's great but she's not you.
- Mike.

807
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.120
No, listen, I...

808
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.560
I've been... I've been thinking
about what you said and, and I'll do it.

809
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.960
Do what?

810
00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.400
[Mike] Whatever it takes.

811
00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.160
I'll be his dad, I'll try again.

812
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.160
- If it means that I get you then I...
- No, Mike.

813
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.600
We're supposed to be together, Lucy.

814
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.720
We love each other.

815
00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.000
That's all that matters.

816
