00:09.092 --> 00:10.885
- [grunts]
- Sam!

00:10.927 --> 00:14.014
- Have you seen a man,
mid-20s, 6 foot, brown hair?

00:14.055 --> 00:15.557
- Is he dangerous?

00:15.598 --> 00:16.850
- Is that heroin?

00:16.891 --> 00:18.184
Who do you think
this belongs to?

00:18.226 --> 00:19.728
Do you want them
to know we found it?

00:19.769 --> 00:21.062
- I've been looking for you.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.690
- Stay away from me.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.025
- Who is he?

00:25.066 --> 00:26.860
- He's my son.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.111
- Wait!

00:28.153 --> 00:30.822
Can you give me
the gun, please?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.407
- We've been trying to get
the go-ahead

00:32.449 --> 00:34.784
to launch a rescue mission,
but we couldn't until now.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.869
- Well, what changed?

00:35.910 --> 00:37.662
- You.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.251
- Mom!

00:44.544 --> 00:46.087
- Izzy!

00:50.467 --> 00:51.593
Run!

00:55.180 --> 00:57.265
- Mom!

00:59.142 --> 01:01.603
- [breathing shakily]

01:09.069 --> 01:11.988
Hey, hey.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.531
Your temperature broke.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.701
How you feeling?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.872
- Could be worse.
- Yeah. Can you get up?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.875
Here. Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.293
How's Sam doing?

01:26.961 --> 01:28.588
- Uh, let me check.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.799
Why don't you get up
and stretch your legs?

01:33.843 --> 01:35.470
[sighs]

01:39.265 --> 01:40.684
- What do you want?

01:40.725 --> 01:42.686
- Just want to check
on how he's doing.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.062
- Let's see.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.272
He fell down a hill,
and then you left him to die.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.274
So I'd say not great.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.152
- I'm sorry about
what happened.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.821
- I get it.
You chose Josh over him.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.823
And I'd choose my dad
over you any day.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.491
So it's all good.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.953
- I'm gonna go
get some food.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.663
I can bring you something back
if you'd like.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.836
- I mean, I won't stop you.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.133
- Next.
- I'm starving.

02:13.174 --> 02:15.802
- Here you go.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.178
Next.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.724
- Seriously?
Who put her in charge?

02:20.765 --> 02:23.643
- Thank you.
- What the hell are they doing?

02:23.685 --> 02:25.812
- Next.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.522
Keep it moving.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.941
- Hey. What's going on?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.318
- The traffic cop decided
to gather what food was left

02:32.360 --> 02:33.528
and start rationing it.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.405
- I've heard worse ideas.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.407
- You didn't get the pickle
and onion tortilla chips.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.825
- What's the matter?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.452
Don't you have some
protein bars hidden somewhere?

02:40.493 --> 02:41.870
- You know, if you--
- You know what?

02:41.911 --> 02:43.955
Why don't you go enjoy
your breakfast somewhere else?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.791
- I know it's only been
a couple of days,

02:46.833 --> 02:48.710
but I'm pretty sure
we're gonna be good friends.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.337
- [scoffs]

02:50.378 --> 02:51.671
- [grunts]

02:51.713 --> 02:53.381
- Give me back
the damn Baby Ruth.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.591
- Not gonna happen.
- Hey, hey, come on.

02:54.632 --> 02:55.967
Let's just calm down, okay?

02:57.218 --> 02:58.511
You've got yours.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.471
Now give it back
and move along.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.847
- Come on, man.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.515
I've been on a juice cleanse
for the past month.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.808
I need more food than this.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.311
- Okay, well, there's not
much food left as it is.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.270
You saying
you're more important

03:07.312 --> 03:08.563
than everyone else here?

03:08.605 --> 03:10.190
- Look, I don't give a damn
who gets what,

03:10.231 --> 03:12.025
but if I don't get something to
eat in the next five seconds,

03:12.067 --> 03:13.860
I'm not gonna be
so nice about it.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.238
- Okay, fine.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.823
Here's your damn candy bar.

03:19.949 --> 03:20.992
Happy now?

03:21.034 --> 03:24.996
- [growling]

03:38.009 --> 03:41.221
- Go, go, go, go, go!
Run, run, run, run!

03:41.262 --> 03:48.436
* *

03:57.153 --> 03:59.030
- Josh!
Josh, what's going on?

04:02.158 --> 04:05.453
- [munching]

04:05.495 --> 04:12.627
* *

04:32.814 --> 04:35.984

that Baby Ruth now.

[indistinct chatter]

04:48.997 --> 04:55.670
* *

04:55.712 --> 04:58.465
- Dr. Nathan.
- Gavin.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.800
- I appreciate you having me.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.802
- You're an important part
of this mission.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.055
My team's creating a map
of what we think Los Angeles

05:05.096 --> 05:07.182
looked like in 10,000 B.C.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.809
I want you to tell them
everything you know

05:09.851 --> 05:11.019
about that place.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.437
Help them figure out
where the survivors are.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.980
- Of course.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.649
- We'll fly there and back
as many times as possible.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.902
Leave no one behind.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.362
- Who's the pilot?

05:20.403 --> 05:22.530
- We're vetting a short list
of candidates as we speak.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.368
- If that's the case, I'd like
to throw my hat in the ring.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.913
You need someone who's flown
experimental prototypes.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.165
You're not gonna find
anyone more qualified.

05:32.207 --> 05:35.251
- You're not in the air force
anymore, Gavin.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.046
It took a lot of convincing
to get this mission approved.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.131
I'm sorry this is
the way it has to be.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.260
- There is someone I know.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.595
We haven't spoken in a while,

05:45.637 --> 05:48.139
but there's no pilot
I trust more.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.350
Guarantee he's one of
the people you're considering.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.519
- What's his name?
- Levi Delgado.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.979
We went
to flight school together.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.856
He was one
of my closest friends.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.233
He's been overseas
about a year,

05:58.274 --> 05:59.818
running operations at Ramstein.

05:59.859 --> 06:04.072
But I hear he transferred
back stateside to Vandenburg.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.615
- Yeah, you're right.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.076
He's on our list.
Let me make the call.

06:08.118 --> 06:15.000
* *

06:15.041 --> 06:17.627
- There's nothing.
It's all gone.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.922
- What the hell was that thing?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.549
- That thing?

06:22.590 --> 06:25.677
That thing is called
a giant ground sloth.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.262
It is one
of the largest mammals

06:27.303 --> 06:29.055
to ever roam North America.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.391
Or should I say was.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.436
- Was?
- He's saying it's extinct.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.562
- If that thing's extinct,

06:35.603 --> 06:37.397
then what the hell
is it doing here?

06:37.439 --> 06:38.815
- What the hell's
it doing here?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.986
This is its home.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.447
[sighs]

06:45.488 --> 06:46.698
Okay, I know
this might be difficult

06:46.740 --> 06:48.074
for some of you
to comprehend,

06:48.116 --> 06:49.743
but I think when we fell
through that sinkhole,

06:49.784 --> 06:52.620
we ended up sometime
around 10,000 B.C.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.123
Or BCE
for the non-Christians.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.167
- Dude, what are you
talking about?

06:57.208 --> 06:59.252
- Obviously the introduction
of time travel

06:59.294 --> 07:00.879
is a lot to take in.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.592
- Come on.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.801
You people aren't
actually listening

07:06.843 --> 07:08.261
to this insanity, are you?

07:08.303 --> 07:09.888
- I think Scott's right.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.473
- You do?

07:12.974 --> 07:15.852
- No, I know how it sounds,
but...

07:15.894 --> 07:18.146
we saw a saber-toothed tiger
in the forest.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.689
And those hills we saw?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.691
They look identical
to the Hollywood Hills.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.111
I think we're still in LA.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.155
- LA? No way.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.782
- We're just somehow--

07:29.866 --> 07:31.993
We're somehow in the past.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.161
And that is what
brought us here.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.954
We all fell through
the same light.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.209
- But if that's true, how are
we gonna get back home?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.795
- Not sitting around here
talking about crazy theories.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.213
- Well, how do you explain
all of this?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.923
- I don't have to.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.883
Y'all want to stay here?
Be my guest.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.469
But I'm gonna find someone who
actually knows where we are

07:49.511 --> 07:51.763
and I'm getting the hell
out of here.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.682
- Look, we all have people
we want to get back to.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.016
And we're gonna try
and find a way.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.935
But nothing's gonna happen
if we starve to death.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.271
- She's right.
That thing ate all our food.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.481
What are you thinking, Eve?

08:01.523 --> 08:04.484
- [sighs]

08:04.526 --> 08:06.152
We need to hunt.

[intriguing music]

08:15.537 --> 08:20.875

08:20.917 --> 08:23.211

we're approaching the hanger.

08:23.253 --> 08:28.466
* *

08:28.508 --> 08:30.176
- Uncle Levi.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.138
- Hey, Izzy.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.390
You look like
you're doing better.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.350
How's physical therapy going?

08:37.392 --> 08:39.394
- Mm, definitely not fun.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.313
- Hey, if anybody can get
through this, it's you.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.565
- Hey, Levi.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.152
- I just came to talk to Gavin.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.570
- He's out back.

08:50.572 --> 08:54.367
[solemn music]

08:54.409 --> 08:55.910
- Hey, man.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.165
- I just wanted you to hear it
from me first.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.083
They're transferring me
to Ramstein.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.628
I hate leaving.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.130
Especially
with Izzy still recovering.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.884
- Orders are orders.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.260
Sure, we'll be all right.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.140
- You said you've been talking
about seeing that place again.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.184
When are you gonna
give this up, Gavin?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.977
Come back to reality.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.689
- You and Eve been talking
about me behind my back.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.317
Is that it?
- Look, man.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.652
She is scared.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.196
We both just want
what's best for you.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.614
You don't pull
yourself together,

09:32.655 --> 09:33.740
you're gonna lose
your family.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.950
- Don't you think I know that?

09:36.910 --> 09:40.914
These things I see have taken
everything from me.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.334
I can't fly anymore.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.962
So save your advice,
'cause it's not gonna help.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.217
Good luck in Germany.

09:52.258 --> 09:59.182
* *

10:16.449 --> 10:18.660
- Levi, it's been a long time.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.123
- I'm so sorry
about Eve and Josh.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.794
They briefed me
on the way over.

10:27.836 --> 10:28.753
Said that you were
gonna be able

10:28.795 --> 10:30.338
to help locate the survivors?

10:30.380 --> 10:31.339
- That's right.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.967
- So...

10:34.009 --> 10:36.636
that place that you've
been seeing all these years--

10:36.678 --> 10:38.430
- It's real.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.352
- I've been trying to wrap
my head around it all morning.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.353
- Yeah.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.816
- Captain Delgado.
I'm Dr. Sophia Nathan.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.234
I'm running point
on the mission.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.360
- It's nice to meet you.

Let's get to it.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.908

11:01.870 --> 11:03.121
- Hey, can I ask you
a question?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.791
You, uh, said you were
an office manager, right?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.001
- That's right.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.669
- Building rabbit snares
out of twigs

11:09.711 --> 11:11.254
part of the job description?

11:11.296 --> 11:13.506
- No, not exactly.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.716
- Go on, then.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.677
- I grew up on a farm
in Montana.

11:17.719 --> 11:21.264
So hunting and fishing
and, you know, riding horses,

11:21.306 --> 11:23.391
it was just a way
of life for us.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.478
That and my dad
really wanted a boy.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.979
- [chuckles]

11:28.021 --> 11:30.190
You ever get back there?

11:30.231 --> 11:32.734
- Actually, I had a trip
planned with Izzy.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.194
Kind of
a mother-daughter thing.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.196
But, um--

11:36.237 --> 11:37.155
- But what?

11:41.076 --> 11:43.495
- But it never happened...

11:43.536 --> 11:44.913
'cause of the accident.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.333
After that...

11:50.043 --> 11:52.087
Everything changed.
I-I changed.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.966
Guess guilt will do that
to you.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.929
- Eve...

12:00.970 --> 12:03.390
what happened
to your daughter...

12:03.431 --> 12:04.474
it's not your fault.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.558
You said it yourself.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.769
You were running late at work.

12:07.811 --> 12:08.895
Your neighbor picked her up--

12:08.937 --> 12:10.438
- It should've been me
driving the car.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.902
- Who's to say it would've gone
any differently?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.113
- You know, I've told you
a lot about myself,

12:18.154 --> 12:20.865
and I--I barely know
anything about you.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.036
- Tell you what.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.081
If we're gonna find
any rabbits,

12:28.123 --> 12:29.624
we should probably be quiet.

12:29.666 --> 12:36.798
* *

12:51.312 --> 12:52.313
- Hey.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.109
- The hell do you want?

12:56.151 --> 12:57.318
- You shouldn't be alone
in these woods.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.781
- Look at you.
Mother of the year.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.241
- I know you're angry.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.452
- Angry?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.162
That's maybe the nicest way
you could put it.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.793
- Lucas, what happened
between me and your father--

13:13.835 --> 13:15.211
- Don't.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.637
- Look, you want to die
in these woods?

13:24.679 --> 13:25.847
Fine.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.140
But I guarantee,
we stick together,

13:27.182 --> 13:29.642
we got a better shot
of surviving.

13:29.684 --> 13:30.977
So why don't you just tell me

13:31.019 --> 13:32.520
what you came out here
looking for?

13:32.562 --> 13:34.481
[dramatic music]

13:34.522 --> 13:35.982
Just answer the question.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.651
Doesn't mean
we're best friends.

13:38.693 --> 13:44.032
* *

13:44.074 --> 13:46.159
What the hell?

13:46.201 --> 13:47.869
- Found it yesterday.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.622
Tiger had fallen in.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.752
Whoever built it
obviously came back,

13:55.794 --> 13:59.339
took the tiger out, reset it.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.174
- So you figured you could
track them and get answers

14:01.216 --> 14:02.884
to where we are
and how to get home?

14:02.926 --> 14:05.887
- Something like that.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.889
- Or maybe there's
a shelter around here.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.310
Or whatever they have
in 10,000 B.C.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.105
- You really believe
that's where we are?

14:15.146 --> 14:16.564
- I don't know.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.904
What do you say
we look together?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.489
- [sighs]

14:28.660 --> 14:30.412
- I'll take that as a yes.

14:32.706 --> 14:36.376
- Well, Dad, that giant
ground thing ate all our food.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.421
So, you know, morning's off
to a great start.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.550
Dad? What's wrong?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.636
- There's something
I need to tell you.

14:46.678 --> 14:50.140
- Okay,
you're kind of freaking me out.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.267
- I can't feel my legs.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.145
- What are you talking about?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.730
Last night, you said
it was just a bruise.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.941
- It started out that way,
but it swelled overnight.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.651
The excess fluid
must be putting pressure

15:01.693 --> 15:04.112
on my spinal cord.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.364
- But that's only temporary,
right?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.033
I mean,
the swelling will go down.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.035
- Only if it's drained.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.664
- Okay, so--so what are we
supposed to do?

15:14.706 --> 15:17.959
- Not we. You.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.254
- What?

15:21.296 --> 15:22.255
- You need to drain the fluid.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.883
- No, Dad.
- Listen, listen.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.093
Eve brought back medical
supplies from the ambulance.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.845
Everything you need
is in there.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.680
- Dad, I'm not a doctor.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.391
I'm not even premed.
Remember? I dropped out.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.810
- It's a simple procedure.
I'll guide you step by step.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.062
- No, this is crazy.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.064
- There's no one else here
who can do it.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.236
It needs to be relieved
in the next few hours,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.030
or I may never walk again.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.199
* *

15:53.203 --> 15:53.411
.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.331
[animals chittering]

15:57.749 --> 15:59.084
[trap snaps]

15:59.125 --> 16:01.711
- You got it.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.463
[chuckles]
- One down.

16:03.505 --> 16:07.467
Now all we need is, like,
ten more to feed everyone.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.927
Aw.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.303
- Good job.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.139
- Hate to have to kill it.
But we gotta eat, right?

16:13.181 --> 16:15.350
[tense music]

16:15.392 --> 16:16.685
Ty?

16:18.520 --> 16:19.562
- Bear.

16:21.856 --> 16:25.068
- [growling]

16:25.735 --> 16:26.820
- What now?

16:26.861 --> 16:27.821
- Don't run.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.781
- [snorting]

16:32.325 --> 16:33.827
- Hey, little guy.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.078
Go, go, go, go, okay.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.040
- [growls]

16:42.127 --> 16:43.962
- Now run.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.756
* *

16:46.798 --> 16:50.135
- [roaring]

16:51.511 --> 16:53.972
- Eve!
Eve, this way! This way!

16:54.014 --> 16:55.140
Come on.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.017
Look, there's a cave.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.977
- [roaring]

16:59.019 --> 17:05.650
* *

17:05.692 --> 17:07.235
- He's coming.
He's coming!

17:07.277 --> 17:14.409
* *

17:28.590 --> 17:33.803
- [grunts] Jesus.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.513
Is this, like,
a medical emergency situation?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.350
- I--I'm good, it's just,
that guy over there,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.560
he's totally eating grass.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.521
- Oh, technically grass is
kind of like a salad, so--

17:47.359 --> 17:48.651
That's just disgusting.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.906
- Hey, you really think
we're in the past?

17:52.947 --> 17:56.076
I mean, that's crazy, right?

17:56.117 --> 17:58.161
- Doesn't mean it's not true.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.206
- Hey, hey, guys.
I need your help.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.707
- What's up?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.043
- Basically, if I don't drain
my dad's back right away,

18:05.085 --> 18:06.378
he'll be paralyzed.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.712
- Wow, that's a lot to take in.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.255
- Yeah, so I need
an anesthetic,

18:09.297 --> 18:11.925
something to numb the pain,
like alcohol.

18:11.966 --> 18:15.345
- Sure, I'll just pop over
to my local BevMo.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.098
- We'll search the cars.
We'll find something.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.226
- Thank you.
Just hurry. Please.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.356
- Now you're really setting
her up for disappointment.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.233
If there was booze lying
around, I would've found it.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.609
- She took care of me
when I was hurt.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.486
Just think.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.862
There has to be something
we can use.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.494
- Hold on. I may have an idea.

18:43.164 --> 18:46.835
- [grunting]

18:48.128 --> 18:49.879
It's useless.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.297
- All right,

18:51.339 --> 18:53.425
we gotta find
another way out of here.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.224
Someone's coming.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.644
* *

19:04.686 --> 19:06.896
- Hello?

19:06.938 --> 19:08.857
- Marybeth?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.316
Lucas.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.651
- What are you guys doing here?

19:11.693 --> 19:13.403
- There's a sabertooth trap
nearby.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.239
We were looking for whoever
built it, but no luck.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.743
- A bear chased us in here.
Cave entrance collapsed in.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.870
It's the only reason
we survived.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.329
- What?

19:25.415 --> 19:27.667
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
That's our only way out.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.211
- No. No, there's gotta be
another way out of here.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.838
- Well, there was a split
in the cave.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.341
We went to the right.
It was a dead end.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.675
Maybe we can get out
the other way.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.219
- Or it's just
another dead end.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.554
- We can't stand here
and do nothing.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.431
- Oh, did I say we should?

19:42.223 --> 19:43.516
- Looks like we're going
the other way.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.352
Just like your mum says.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.229
- How do you know she's my mom?

19:48.271 --> 19:50.023
- No one argues
like family, mate.

19:50.065 --> 19:55.320
* *

19:55.362 --> 19:57.864
- Hey, Riley. Check this out.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.410
- There's no alcohol,
but there is this.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.080
- Ta-da.

20:05.121 --> 20:09.501
* *

20:09.542 --> 20:11.086
- Are you kidding me right now?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.295
- What is that?

20:12.337 --> 20:13.755
- This is the heroin we found.

20:13.797 --> 20:14.798
- Heroin?

20:14.839 --> 20:17.258
- There's a drug dealer
down here.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.802
Apparently we've got
a pretty eclectic group.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.762
- I literally want
to kill you two.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.972
- I get the instinct,
but I've read somewhere

20:23.014 --> 20:25.517
that heroin used to be
prescribed as pain medication.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.435
- Where'd you read that,
"High Times"?

20:27.477 --> 20:29.270
- Riley, he's right.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.106
Heroin's an opiate.
It's made from morphine.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.400
- But you have to walk me
through the procedure.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.734
How do you plan to do that
when you're high?

20:34.776 --> 20:37.153
- You're not gonna give me
a full dose.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.905
Just enough to dull the pain.

20:38.947 --> 20:39.948
Listen to me.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.743
I'm gonna be fine.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.162
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.997
Now, you ready to do this?

20:48.039 --> 20:51.334
* *

20:55.839 --> 20:56.006
.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.257
- This is a map
of Pleistocene-era Los Angeles.

20:58.633 --> 20:59.884
Based on what you've seen,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.554
where can we find
our survivors?

21:02.595 --> 21:05.056
- They're here,
in this large clearing.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.978
- And you've seen them there?
- I did.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.980
This is where
I found Eve's ring.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.315
Off Mulholland.

21:14.357 --> 21:16.443
I also saw her
walking by a river.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.319
There's one in that area.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.613
- What's now the LA River.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.740
In between those two points,

21:21.781 --> 21:23.533
there is only
one large clearing.

21:23.575 --> 21:26.202
The terrain was mostly
dense forest and wetlands.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.038
- Any idea where
I can touch down?

21:28.079 --> 21:29.164
- Based on the topography,

21:29.205 --> 21:30.373
there should be
a small strip of land

21:30.415 --> 21:32.042
about a mile north
of the clearing.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.170
- So?

21:35.211 --> 21:38.173
[dramatic music]

21:38.214 --> 21:39.382
* *

21:39.424 --> 21:41.176
- Set a flight plan.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.094
We'll meet back here
in an hour and review.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.638
- Okay, let's go.
- Set up tracking coordinates.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.349
- If you can,
I'm gonna need everything--

21:47.390 --> 21:49.601
elevation,
estimated wind speeds,

21:49.642 --> 21:50.852
anything you think
you might be able to predict.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.605
- Yes, sir.
- [exhales heavily]

21:53.646 --> 21:55.732
[indistinct chatter]

21:55.774 --> 21:56.858
- I don't know what to say.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.818
- You don't need
to say anything.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.029
I'm just glad you're here.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.948
If it's not me flying
that plane down there,

22:03.990 --> 22:05.033
had to be you.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.743
[cell phone buzzes]

22:09.412 --> 22:10.872
- It's Izzy.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.041
She wanted to see you
before you flew out.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.834
[laughs] Come on.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.755
- I cannot believe
you're old enough to drive.

22:18.797 --> 22:20.340
- Plus, they gave me
handicap plates,

22:20.382 --> 22:23.051
which means I can park
pretty much wherever I want.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.719
Thing's worth
its weight in gold.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.471
- [laughs] Congratulations.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.056
You know,
she gets this from you.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.767
- Yeah. Well, this is why
you shouldn't've left town.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.644
She needs better role models.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.525
Hey.
You Okay?

22:38.566 --> 22:40.485
- I'm so nervous,
I feel like I could puke.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.780
- Don't worry.

22:43.822 --> 22:46.616
I'll be there and back
before you know it.

22:46.658 --> 22:47.992
- You have to.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.161
Who else is gonna be
my tour guide in Berlin?

22:50.203 --> 22:51.746
- I'd be happy to do it.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.834
- Mom said it was one of her
favorite places she ever went.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.923
- It's an incredible city.
You'd love it.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.425
It's part of the reason
I chose to go there.

23:03.466 --> 23:10.640
* *

23:11.850 --> 23:13.685
Anyway, we should get back.

23:13.727 --> 23:20.859
* *

23:28.950 --> 23:32.287
- Have the drugs kicked in yet?
- I'm not feeling any pain.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.706
- Okay, that's good, I guess.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.458
So then what's first?

23:36.499 --> 23:38.335
- Just like I said.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.754
Move your finger down the spine
of my lower back.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.299
- Okay, I got it.

23:44.341 --> 23:47.052
- And press down.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.429
That's where
the lumbar meets the--

23:49.471 --> 23:51.514
- The sacrum.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.061
- I think we may have
given him too much.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.022
- No, no, I'm fine.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.902
That's where you're
going to insert the needle.

24:05.362 --> 24:08.406
Once you feel it pop,

24:08.448 --> 24:10.617
attach the syringe.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.660
Draw six ccs.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.707
- Okay,
I'm gonna insert it now.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.292
- Remember...

24:20.710 --> 24:22.671
You have to push
through the muscle.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.255
Once you do--

24:27.217 --> 24:28.760
- Once I do, what, Dad?

24:31.388 --> 24:32.972
Once I do, what?
Dad?

24:33.014 --> 24:35.558
- Uh-oh.
- Dad? Oh, my God, Dad!

24:37.227 --> 24:40.188
- [wincing]

24:42.899 --> 24:44.484
- You know,
we've been walking awhile.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.985
Maybe we should take a break.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.237
- Thanks.

24:54.703 --> 24:57.080
Hey, shh, shh.
Can you hear that?

24:57.122 --> 25:00.083
[water trickling]

25:02.419 --> 25:09.342
* *

25:12.721 --> 25:13.972
- It's a dead end.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.682
- So we keep
searching the cave.

25:15.724 --> 25:16.599
- We already
went the other way.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.351
We've searched everywhere.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.937
- I'm not dying in this cave.
I'm gonna find a way out.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.606
- And how do you suppose
we do that?

25:23.648 --> 25:27.318
- It's not a dead end.
There's algae.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.779
Algae needs sunlight to grow,

25:29.821 --> 25:31.740
which means it came
from somewhere else,

25:31.781 --> 25:33.324
somewhere where there's light.

25:33.366 --> 25:36.578
- You think there's a way out
underneath the water?

25:36.619 --> 25:38.663
- There's only one way
to find out.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.081
- Ty.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.916
We have no idea
what's in that water,

25:41.958 --> 25:43.960
much less
if it leads anywhere.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.796
No.
That's--it's too dangerous.

25:46.838 --> 25:49.341
- So we're staying here?

25:49.382 --> 25:52.302
- Eve, he's right.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.345
We gotta try.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.512
- No, there has to be
another way.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.764
[water splashes]

25:55.805 --> 25:57.807
- Ty!
- Ty?

25:57.849 --> 25:59.142
I don't see him.
- Ty! Come on, Ty!

25:59.184 --> 26:01.061
- Ty! Ty!

26:05.106 --> 26:05.315
.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.149
- Maybe we should go after him.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.694
- Maybe he found
the other side.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.238
- Or maybe not.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.948
- Oh, come on, Ty.

26:13.990 --> 26:17.160
[tense music]

26:17.202 --> 26:19.704
* *

26:19.746 --> 26:21.039
Come on.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.501
[water splashes]

26:24.542 --> 26:26.836
Ty!

26:26.878 --> 26:28.672
Ty, you okay?

26:28.713 --> 26:30.799
- Yeah.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.093
There's a way out
on the other side of the cave.

26:33.134 --> 26:34.511
- [sighs]

26:34.552 --> 26:37.347
[dramatic music]

26:37.389 --> 26:38.682
* *

26:38.723 --> 26:41.643
But, guys, there's
something else you gotta see.

26:41.685 --> 26:45.980
* *

26:46.022 --> 26:47.691
- Everything okay?

26:47.732 --> 26:49.234
- Yeah.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.361
Just, um,

26:51.403 --> 26:52.737
preflight planning.

26:54.698 --> 26:56.199
- [sighs]

26:56.241 --> 26:57.492
- What's up?

26:57.534 --> 27:00.036
- Look, we both know
how these missions can go.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.789
I don't want to leave
anything unsaid.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.126
Why did you leave for Germany?

27:08.044 --> 27:09.754
- I was transferred.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.297
- You're not telling me
the truth.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.508
You just told Izzy
you chose to go there.

27:13.550 --> 27:14.843
- Gavin, just let it go--

27:14.884 --> 27:16.803
- Levi, look at me
and tell me I'm wrong.

27:16.845 --> 27:21.599
* *

27:21.641 --> 27:22.892
Why'd you leave?

27:22.934 --> 27:29.774
* *

27:32.110 --> 27:34.070
- I left because
I couldn't handle it.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.451
- Couldn't handle what?

27:42.871 --> 27:44.330
- You and Eve.

27:44.372 --> 27:50.920
* *

27:50.962 --> 27:52.547
You have to understand.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.467
Eve was scared.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.472
And you were drinking
all the time.

28:00.513 --> 28:03.141
Talking about some place.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.727
We didn't know it was real.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.812
- Do you still love her?

28:07.854 --> 28:14.444
* *

28:15.779 --> 28:17.614
- Gavin, I'm sorry.

28:17.655 --> 28:24.537
* *

28:35.799 --> 28:38.802
- Dad? Dad. Dad!

28:38.843 --> 28:40.053
Dad, please wake up.

28:40.095 --> 28:41.054
- Yeah, I don't think
that's working.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.639
- No more talking.
- Dad.

28:42.681 --> 28:44.015
I don't know what to do.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.350
Not without him
walking me through it.

28:45.392 --> 28:48.561
- He already did.
Just remember what he said.

28:48.603 --> 28:51.648
Once you feel a pop,
attach the syringe.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.483
Draw six ccs.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.444
- Okay.

28:58.238 --> 29:00.699
- Hey, you can do this.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.410
- I'm not sure that I can.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.495
- Close your eyes.

29:05.537 --> 29:06.705
Take a deep breath.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.874
- [breathes deeply]

29:12.836 --> 29:14.379
- That help?

29:14.421 --> 29:21.386
* *

29:26.224 --> 29:29.185
- There's no fluid.
Nothing's happening.

29:29.227 --> 29:31.104
Maybe I didn't get it in
far enough?

29:31.146 --> 29:32.731
I just--I don't--I don't know.
I don't know.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.649
- Just keep going.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.695
- Okay.

29:38.737 --> 29:45.910
* *

30:10.935 --> 30:13.229
All right, that's six ccs.

30:13.271 --> 30:14.522
- I think you did it, Riley.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.860
- Is it okay to talk now?

30:18.902 --> 30:21.946
- Now I just need him
to wake up.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.740
See if he can feel his legs.

30:23.782 --> 30:29.162
* *

30:29.204 --> 30:30.914
- You good?
- Yeah.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.749
- This way.

30:32.791 --> 30:38.004
* *

30:38.046 --> 30:39.798
[ominous music]

30:39.839 --> 30:41.174
- Oh, damn.

30:41.216 --> 30:43.385
* *

30:43.426 --> 30:44.552
- What the hell?

30:47.305 --> 30:49.015
- He was living in this cave.

30:52.769 --> 30:56.064
- Kelso Valley College,
Mojave, California.

30:56.106 --> 30:58.024
How did he get here?
- Don't know.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.651
But by these markings,

30:59.693 --> 31:02.362
looks like he was here
at least a few years.

31:04.489 --> 31:07.450
- Till he gave up,
blew his brains out.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.831
He was here all that time.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.959
He never found a way home.
And neither will we.

31:16.001 --> 31:20.255
* *

31:28.179 --> 31:28.388
.

31:28.430 --> 31:29.014
- Please wake up, Dad.

31:30.598 --> 31:32.726
Please, oh, God.
Please, please.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.812
[dramatic music]

31:35.854 --> 31:37.981
- Riley.

31:38.023 --> 31:39.858
- Dad?

31:39.899 --> 31:41.943
Dad.

31:41.985 --> 31:45.071
Hey, hey, let's get you up.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.865
Here.

31:46.906 --> 31:52.912
* *

31:52.954 --> 31:54.706
Can you feel anything?

31:56.875 --> 31:58.960
- I don't know.
- Okay.

31:59.002 --> 32:01.546
Well, um,
try to move your toes.

32:03.882 --> 32:05.425
- [grunts]

32:07.010 --> 32:08.636
I can't.

32:08.678 --> 32:12.182
- Try harder. Come on.
- [grunts]

32:12.223 --> 32:14.184
- Come on, Dad.

32:14.225 --> 32:17.020
Keep trying.
Come on.

32:17.062 --> 32:21.649
* *

32:21.691 --> 32:24.069
They're moving.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.487
Oh, they're moving.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.325
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

32:30.367 --> 32:32.327
But I've had about
eight heart attacks today,

32:32.369 --> 32:33.745
so let's never
do that again, okay?

32:33.787 --> 32:34.996
- Mm-hmm.

32:35.038 --> 32:37.082
- Okay.

32:37.123 --> 32:42.337
* *

32:42.379 --> 32:44.631
- We can't tell anyone
what we found in that cave.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.344
Right now,
people still have hope.

32:49.386 --> 32:51.096
We take that away,
it's a dangerous thing.

32:52.055 --> 32:54.599
- Even if we keep this quiet,
people are gonna lose hope

32:54.641 --> 32:56.393
pretty quickly
when they're starving to death.

32:56.434 --> 32:58.353
- No one's gonna starve
to death.

32:58.395 --> 33:00.397
That guy in the cave,
he lived here for a while.

33:00.438 --> 33:02.399
He obviously found food.

33:03.942 --> 33:06.820
- Eve? Where are you going?

33:06.861 --> 33:08.363
- Look.

33:11.074 --> 33:13.493
Look at this.
Mushrooms.

33:15.745 --> 33:18.164
- Uh-uh. Hell no.
I'm not eating those.

33:18.206 --> 33:19.374
They're probably poisonous.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.376
- No, they're not. Trust me.

33:21.418 --> 33:22.627
They were everywhere
where I grew up.

33:22.669 --> 33:25.338
They're called
chicken of the woods.

33:27.799 --> 33:30.635
They're--they're better
when they're cooked.

33:30.677 --> 33:37.475
* *

33:37.517 --> 33:39.686
- Okay,
I'm officially starving.

33:39.728 --> 33:41.271
- Join the club.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.148
- Do you remember
that movie "Alive"?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.066
The one about the soccer team
that crashed in the Andes

33:45.108 --> 33:46.860
and everyone ate each other?

33:46.901 --> 33:49.446
Just wondering how long
it'll take us to get there,

33:49.487 --> 33:50.613
'cause they went
to cannibalism

33:50.655 --> 33:52.157
a lot sooner
than you think.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.159
- Remember
that no-talking thing?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.368
Let's try that again.

33:57.037 --> 33:58.955
- Josh.
- Mom.

33:58.997 --> 34:02.042
Where have you been?

34:02.083 --> 34:03.335
Why are you all wet?

34:03.376 --> 34:04.878
- It's a long story.
You okay?

34:04.919 --> 34:06.087
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:06.129 --> 34:07.172
- Better.
- Okay.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.049
- Any luck finding food?

34:09.090 --> 34:11.426
- Well, not with hunting,
but...

34:11.468 --> 34:13.470
we did find these.

34:14.804 --> 34:16.848
- Eve really came through
for everyone.

34:16.890 --> 34:19.684
- Amazing. I was thinking
about going vegan anyway.

34:19.726 --> 34:22.228
- And there's plenty
for everyone.

34:22.896 --> 34:24.689
- Guess you didn't find
anyone else out there, huh?

34:24.731 --> 34:29.152
* *

34:29.194 --> 34:31.905
- No. Not a soul.

34:31.946 --> 34:37.744
* *

34:46.252 --> 34:47.462
- Good luck.

34:47.504 --> 34:54.386
* *

34:54.427 --> 34:55.595
- Can you give us a minute?

34:59.599 --> 35:00.892
Gavin--
- Levi.

35:00.934 --> 35:03.269
Right now, all that matters
is the mission.

35:04.938 --> 35:08.233
When you find Eve,
I need you to give her this.

35:08.274 --> 35:15.031
* *

35:15.073 --> 35:17.075
You bring my family home.

35:17.117 --> 35:19.202
- You got my word.

35:19.244 --> 35:25.959
* *

35:34.467 --> 35:35.802
- What do you want?

35:38.388 --> 35:40.849
- Um, listen.

35:40.890 --> 35:41.850
About your father--

35:41.891 --> 35:43.059
- I don't want to talk
about him.

35:43.101 --> 35:44.644
- I need you to know.

35:45.979 --> 35:50.650
What I did,
I didn't have a choice.

35:50.692 --> 35:53.945
- You pulled the trigger.
You had a choice.

35:53.987 --> 35:56.906
- I didn't want it
to go that way,

35:56.948 --> 36:00.493
and I'm not gonna stand here
and apologize for it.

36:00.535 --> 36:03.663
- No.
No, you wouldn't, would you?

36:03.705 --> 36:05.457
I don't want to talk to you.

36:06.958 --> 36:08.585
I don't want anything
to do with you.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.963
You're on your own.

36:12.005 --> 36:18.928
* *

36:31.149 --> 36:32.984
- [sighs]

36:33.026 --> 36:38.656
* *

36:38.698 --> 36:41.368
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.205
I don't know
if I would've gotten

36:45.246 --> 36:46.581
through today without you.

36:46.623 --> 36:49.000
- Oh, something tells me
you'd have worked out a way.

36:51.961 --> 36:53.046
Eve?

36:55.298 --> 36:59.094
Listen, I owe you
an explanation

36:59.135 --> 37:01.137
about what I've
been going through...

37:02.722 --> 37:04.683
And why I have the gun,
everything.

37:09.312 --> 37:12.315
I have a brain tumor, Eve.

37:12.357 --> 37:13.483
It's terminal.

37:14.943 --> 37:16.528
- Oh, Ty.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.364
Oh, I'm so sorry.

37:19.406 --> 37:21.783
- Since I was diagnosed,
I just--

37:21.825 --> 37:23.910
I felt like
I lost my purpose.

37:25.537 --> 37:28.873
I quit my practice,
pushed my wife away.

37:30.458 --> 37:32.669
I just wanted it all
to be over, but...

37:34.713 --> 37:36.840
I don't want to end up
like that man in the cave.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.427
So I--

37:43.596 --> 37:45.557
Would you mind
holding on to this for me?

37:47.559 --> 37:49.144
- Sure.

37:54.274 --> 37:58.445
- You know, you have a choice
to make too, Eve.

37:59.529 --> 38:01.948
Guilt is too tough a thing
to carry around.

38:03.283 --> 38:04.576
You can let it go.

38:04.617 --> 38:05.869
- Yeah, it's just
not that easy.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.037
- Why not?

38:10.957 --> 38:13.668
- The day of the accident,
I wasn't working late.

38:13.710 --> 38:20.717
* *

38:20.759 --> 38:23.303
I was with someone.

38:23.345 --> 38:30.477
* *

38:31.311 --> 38:34.314
- I understand.

38:34.356 --> 38:36.900
But that had nothing to do
with what happened.

38:36.941 --> 38:38.693
It may be hard to believe
because that's what you've been

38:38.735 --> 38:42.614
telling yourself all this time,
but it's the truth.

38:44.115 --> 38:47.994
I know you're not
asking for it, but my advice?

38:49.704 --> 38:51.247
Move forward.

38:52.499 --> 38:55.627
Because this guilt...

38:55.669 --> 38:57.087
it's not doing you any good.

Initiating descent.

39:30.495 --> 39:37.794

39:38.503 --> 39:40.755
Okay,
I'm entering the sinkhole.

Losing control of engine one.

40:21.171 --> 40:22.756
- Levi? Come in.
- Control--engine one.

40:22.797 --> 40:24.466
Come in. Do you copy?

40:24.507 --> 40:27.052
[radio signal breaking up]
Levi, what's going on?

40:27.093 --> 40:30.722
- Switching to manual.
I can't get control.

40:32.515 --> 40:34.476
- Captain Delgado?
Are you there?

40:34.517 --> 40:36.686
- Right engine on fire.
I repeat.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.980
Right engine on fire.
Going down!

40:39.022 --> 40:42.275
- Levi!
Levi, do you copy?

40:42.317 --> 40:48.990

40:53.703 --> 40:55.121
- We've lost him.
