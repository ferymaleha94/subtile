WEBVTT

00:07.572 --> 00:09.052
Veronica.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.575
- Can I have a moment
to say goodbye?

00:13.187 --> 00:15.015
There they are.

00:15.058 --> 00:17.321
Stop. Let them go, Silas.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.802
- About your father,
I didn't have a choice.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.064
You pulled the trigger.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.501
- I didn't want it
to go that way.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.590
<i>- This is your </i>
last chance, Gavin.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.201
- They're gonna
shoot you down, Dad.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.290
- Markman, hold your fire.
I'm coming down.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.205
- Levi, I can't
let you do this.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.033
Everyone on that flight
will die.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.686
We're not going anywhere.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.211
- Diana!
- She's gone.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.215
- I told you
Dad wasn't gonna come.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.695
Now we're stuck down here
because of you.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.708
Hey.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.319
What are you doing?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.234
- There's a funeral
in the morning for Diana.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.236
Thought this was the least
I could do.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.676
- You're hurting,
but this isn't on you.

01:08.546 --> 01:11.071
Look, neither of us
wanted this to happen.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.724
But she shot first.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.117
- Yeah,
after being stuck down here

01:14.161 --> 01:15.858
for three years,
can you blame her?

01:17.251 --> 01:18.426
We don't do what we did,

01:18.469 --> 01:20.210
we'd be putting our sons
in the ground

01:20.254 --> 01:21.646
along with everyone else
on that plane.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.126
- That's not the way
they see it.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.128
No, I suppose it's not.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.869
There's nothing you can do
about that.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.438
My experience is,
once someone's decided

01:30.481 --> 01:33.441
you're the bad guy,
there's no changing their mind.

01:38.054 --> 01:39.577
Where are you taking us?

01:39.621 --> 01:41.231
- I know we're all freaking out
about the portal closing.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.755
But trust me,
this is gonna cheer you up.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.844
- Unless you found
another way home,

01:45.888 --> 01:47.237
nothing's gonna cheer us up.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.804
Hold that thought.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.598
- Is that gold?
- More specifically,

02:00.642 --> 02:03.166
that's American Civil War gold
from 1863.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.429
Lucas and I found it.

02:05.473 --> 02:06.778
- How the hell did it end up
down here?

02:06.822 --> 02:08.911
- My theory,
and I think this is a good one,

02:08.954 --> 02:11.740
is that it fell through another
sinkhole from the 1800s.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.177
- I'm still waiting
for the part

02:14.221 --> 02:15.396
where this cheers us up.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.614
Come on, think about it.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.442
If there was
a sinkhole in 1863,

02:18.486 --> 02:20.444
not to mention the one
Diana came through,

02:20.488 --> 02:21.706
maybe there are more,

02:21.750 --> 02:23.752
which means there could be
another way home.

02:23.795 --> 02:26.450
- Okay, this might be
my desperation talking,

02:26.494 --> 02:28.974
but I think
that actually makes sense.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.324
No, it doesn't.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.589
We're not getting out of here.
My mom made sure of that.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.373
The sooner the both of you
accept that,

02:36.417 --> 02:38.854
the better off you'll be.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.377
Josh.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.951
Hey.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.127
Can we talk about this?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.738
Hey,
I know you're angry with me,

02:53.782 --> 02:55.436
but I was just trying
to keep you safe.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.264
Don't make this about me.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.874
We're here because you chose
to believe Dad.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.049
Look where that got us.

03:00.092 --> 03:03.487
- Josh, you would've died
on that plane.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.489
- Yeah? Well, I was willing
to take the risk.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.448
So was everyone else.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.667
You took that choice away.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.061
- We're gonna have to find
a way to get past this.

03:14.063 --> 03:16.021
I don't think we can.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.388
Hello?

03:36.868 --> 03:39.044
Veronica, is that you?

03:50.099 --> 03:52.710
Please, I need your help.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.068
No, no, no.
No, no, no, wait!

04:07.377 --> 04:08.596
Thank you.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.947
No, wait. Don't leave.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.645
My hands. My--

04:23.393 --> 04:24.829
I have to go.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.353
No, wait.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.702
Please.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.799
Before she died...

04:37.842 --> 04:39.322
Diana told me
that all she wanted

04:39.366 --> 04:41.498
was to see her partner,
Sophia, again.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.463
I'm so sorry I couldn't get you
back home to her, Diana.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.817
Rest in peace.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.047
Hey, how you holding up?

05:09.091 --> 05:11.006
Not great. You?

05:11.049 --> 05:13.313
Been better.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.662
Have you seen Ty?

05:14.705 --> 05:16.359
Lilly said he didn't
come back last night.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.969
- No.
He should've been back by now.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.536
- We should go look for him.
- Yeah.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.452
Marybeth, we need to talk.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.020
Okay.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.328
- The group's decided
we'd feel more comfortable

05:28.371 --> 05:30.199
if you handed over your gun.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.071
Hey, this isn't funny.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.377
That's where you're wrong.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.987
You believe
I'm just gonna give up my gun

05:36.031 --> 05:37.424
in a place like this?

05:37.467 --> 05:38.599
You killed Diana.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.209
I was defending myself.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.689
I heard that before.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.170
This isn't the first time
she's killed someone

05:45.214 --> 05:46.346
and said it was self-defense.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.477
She killed someone once?

05:52.221 --> 05:53.614
It wasn't like that.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.355
It isn't like that.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.486
Maybe so.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.661
But if you hadn't pulled
your gun,

05:57.705 --> 05:58.880
none of this
would've ever happened.

05:58.923 --> 06:02.057
- Levi, nobody wanted Diana
to get hurt.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.667
You know that.

06:03.711 --> 06:06.888
- If that plane took off,
everyone on it would be dead.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.804
We saved you people.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.936
- No, the two of you
stranded us here.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.503
I mean, who knows
what they're gonna do next?

06:14.722 --> 06:16.985
You both need to go.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.160
Go where?

06:18.203 --> 06:19.901
Anywhere but here.

06:19.944 --> 06:22.773
- Yeah.
- Yeah, get out of here.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.688
- Hey, no. We're not
sending them out there alone.

06:24.732 --> 06:25.863
It's too dangerous.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.082
- Come on, man,
you don't mean it.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.213
No, I do.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.041
- This is crazy.
They'll die out there.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.652
Say something.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.830
- Look, we never talked about
banishing anyone.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.353
This was just about the gun.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.050
- Yeah, well, no one talked
to me about anything.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.357
And I say none of us
are safe with them around.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.706
- He's right.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.187
All right, everyone relax.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.145
We need to settle this fairly.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.538
Then let's take a vote.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.193
Yeah, let's vote on it.

06:51.236 --> 06:53.543
- They need to go.
- Who here wants them to go?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.429
There you have it.

07:21.876 --> 07:22.093
.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.797
What about my family?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.581
- There's another way
to save them.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.583
Go back to the beginning,
Gavin.

07:33.627 --> 07:37.935
November 16, 1988.
Remember that date.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.299
What's this?

07:54.343 --> 07:55.518
It's an NDA.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.041
Saying what?

07:57.085 --> 07:58.390
- That you're gonna
leave this alone

07:58.434 --> 08:00.262
and never mention anything
about that sinkhole.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.787
- My family's still down there.
You want me to just walk away?

08:03.831 --> 08:05.528
- You flew into
restricted air space.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.877
You ignored government orders.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.184
You jeopardized
millions of lives.

08:09.227 --> 08:12.143
Now, you're getting a free pass
because everyone wants this

08:12.187 --> 08:13.797
to go away.

08:13.841 --> 08:17.497
I suggest that you take it.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.505
Dad!

08:25.548 --> 08:27.071
Hey. Hey.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.946
I'm so glad they let you out.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.948
Yeah.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.080
They made me sign an NDA...

08:37.691 --> 08:40.824
Promise to put
all of this behind us.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.697
What about Mom and Josh?

08:46.003 --> 08:47.570
- Let's just take
one thing at a time.

08:50.268 --> 08:53.010
It's been a long night.
Why don't you get some sleep?

08:53.054 --> 08:54.359
Okay?

08:54.403 --> 08:55.883
Okay.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.247
Thanks for coming.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.988
- What the hell happened
up there with Aldridge?

09:14.031 --> 09:16.512
- Well, I was hoping
you could tell me that.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.601
Did you know
she was gonna jump?

09:18.645 --> 09:20.342
What she's gonna do
once she gets down there?

09:20.385 --> 09:23.606
- No. Honestly, I'm just
as surprised as you are.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.216
Did she say anything to you
on the plane?

09:25.260 --> 09:27.349
- She said there might be
another way

09:27.392 --> 09:28.742
to save Eve and Josh.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.135
How?

09:31.179 --> 09:32.789
- She said to go back
to the beginning.

09:32.833 --> 09:36.706
And then she gave me a date--
November 16, 1988.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.579
That's around the same time
I was adopted.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.364
Somehow my past
is tied to all this.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.584
I just need to figure out how,

09:44.627 --> 09:46.281
and then maybe
I can bring them home.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.239
- So what are you gonna do?
- Okay.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.720
My parents always said that
I was anonymously dropped off

09:50.764 --> 09:52.287
at Child Protective Services.

09:52.330 --> 09:55.072
I need to find out
who that person was.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.597
The problem is,
my records are sealed.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.947
So I thought you might have
a contact

09:59.990 --> 10:02.210
- who could help with that.
- No, Gavin,

10:02.253 --> 10:05.300
even if I wanted to,
I signed the same NDA as you.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.649
We could both go to prison.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.738
- Yeah.
But it doesn't say anything

10:08.782 --> 10:10.392
about helping a friend
reconnect

10:10.435 --> 10:12.873
with their birth family,
does it?

10:15.527 --> 10:17.617
You want to bring Diana home?

10:17.660 --> 10:19.575
This could be our chance.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.862
You stitched me up.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.343
Thank you.

10:50.606 --> 10:51.999
You're a medicine woman.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.437
I'm Ty, by the way.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.920
My friends told me about
a village not far from here.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.399
Is that your home?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.141
- Your friends
entered uninvited.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.969
I know.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.971
And they're sorry, really.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.973
They were just looking
for answers,

11:10.017 --> 11:12.149
trying to get back to our home.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.022
They didn't mean any harm.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.981
Yes.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.766
Sky People
seem to say that a lot.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.681
I've found it's seldom true.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.641
Sky People?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.425
- You're not the first
to come through the light.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.776
- How long have others
been coming here?

11:30.864 --> 11:32.343
As long as we can remember.

11:32.387 --> 11:35.172
- Does that mean
there's a way out of here?

11:35.216 --> 11:36.913
Back to my world?

11:36.957 --> 11:38.872
I don't know. I have to go.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.482
No, please, wait.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.831
- You'll be safe here until
you're strong enough to leave.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.790
Wait, please. Don't go.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.356
I need answers.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.359
What's wrong?

11:49.796 --> 11:51.493
A storm is coming.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.931
Neither of us can leave.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.511
- Eve, you're not
going anywhere.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.818
No, I should go.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.428
Eve, please.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.083
- You don't think
I deserve this?

12:17.388 --> 12:19.434
You want me to say it?

12:19.477 --> 12:21.218
Okay.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.742
I'm mad as hell
at you right now.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.091
I think you made
the wrong choice.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.919
I could've brought
everyone home safely.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.050
But that doesn't mean
I want you

12:27.094 --> 12:28.356
to go out into the woods
to die.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.749
- Yeah, well, looks like
you're alone in that.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.663
- People aren't
thinking clearly.

12:31.707 --> 12:32.882
Josh isn't thinking clearly.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.928
- Which is exactly
why I should go.

12:36.364 --> 12:38.540
Look, I'll go to
the caves with Marybeth,

12:38.583 --> 12:42.283
and once people calm down,
I'll come back, okay?

12:43.763 --> 12:44.764
- Okay, then I'm coming
with you.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.200
No.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.810
No, I need to do this
on my own.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.159
Eve.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.903
Look after Josh for me.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.298
Thank you.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.478
Hey, we need to talk.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.219
About what?

13:05.262 --> 13:07.090
- About how you went all
"Survivor"

13:07.134 --> 13:08.613
on your mom and Marybeth.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.354
Wasn't just me.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.226
Thanks for your help, Josh.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.531
If we're gonna start
a fire later,

13:13.575 --> 13:14.968
we need to keep this wood dry.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.971
- Has everyone
lost their mind?

13:18.014 --> 13:19.711
You two are acting
like nothing's wrong.

13:19.755 --> 13:20.930
- Look, emotions
are running high.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.323
We let people cool down.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.281
Then we can revisit
all of this.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.283
Hey, guys, we need to talk.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.458
Not now, Scott.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.460
- It's actually
fairly time-sensitive.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.635
What is it?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.899
- Back in 10,000 B.C.,
the climate in LA

13:32.942 --> 13:36.163
was quite different,
as perhaps you can tell.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.339
We're in the Ice Age,
and with that came

13:38.382 --> 13:41.995
violent winter storms,
oftentimes out of nowhere.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.824
I'm talking snow
with hurricane-like winds.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.434
Based on those clouds
over there,

13:46.477 --> 13:48.958
I'd say things are gonna get
real bad real fast.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.438
We need to get ready.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.832
- All right. But I don't think
we need to panic.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.147
Tell that to them.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.462
Shouldn't you be leaving?

14:14.505 --> 14:16.507
- I don't care
how much you hate me.

14:16.551 --> 14:19.119
Nothing I did warrants the way
you threw me under the bus.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.642
Ah, always a victim.

14:23.471 --> 14:26.561
- Diana died because
I was saving your ass.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.605
How about a thank-you?

14:28.955 --> 14:30.130
Are we done?

14:32.828 --> 14:34.612
I've tried with you.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.440
I really have.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.313
You don't want
a relationship, fine.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.402
You got it.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.707
Good.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.888
- Hey, the weather's
changing pretty fast.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.019
We should get going.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.760
- I was getting ready
to leave anyway.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.941
Lucas!

15:00.812 --> 15:02.031
Hey, get off me!

15:03.380 --> 15:05.078
Look out!

15:08.603 --> 15:10.605
Marybeth! Lucas!

15:14.000 --> 15:14.391
.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.227
Lucas?

15:24.271 --> 15:25.837
Lucas!

15:25.881 --> 15:26.926
No, no, no.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.627
Thank God.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.939
Help!

15:41.288 --> 15:43.290
Help!

15:43.333 --> 15:45.118
We're trapped in here!

15:45.161 --> 15:46.510
Can anybody hear--

15:47.947 --> 15:50.123
Marybeth! Lucas!

15:50.166 --> 15:51.689
Eve, you okay?

15:51.733 --> 15:53.561
- Yeah. Yeah. But Marybeth
and Lucas are in here.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.476
- We gotta get them out.
- Everyone spread out,

15:55.519 --> 15:56.999
see if we can
pull some rubble off.

16:00.872 --> 16:03.266
Be careful, we don't want
to cause a collapse.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.402
This isn't working.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.012
It's too heavy.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.972
- They're right. We need tools
to break up the concrete.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.670
- When I was driving back
from the plane yesterday,

16:15.713 --> 16:17.454
I saw an 18-wheeler.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.718
Maybe there's tools inside or
something else that can help.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.372
You remember where it was?

16:22.416 --> 16:25.419
- A couple of miles
east of here.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.682
- That's not far.
I can take the Jeep.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.815
- I'll go with you.
You're gonna need help.

16:30.859 --> 16:31.947
- You sure?
- Yeah.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.036
But let's go now
before I change my mind.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.978
- Hey, kiddo,
get any sleep?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.110
Not really.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.720
But I'm not letting that
hold me back.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.548
So what's our plan?

17:07.591 --> 17:09.071
- I thought I'd
cook you some eggs

17:09.115 --> 17:10.855
and drive you to school.

17:11.595 --> 17:12.770
You're kidding, right?

17:15.251 --> 17:16.905
I'm not going to school.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.866
I know this is hard.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.085
But I think it'll be good
for you

17:23.129 --> 17:26.045
to get back to a routine,
something normal.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.265
There is no normal now.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.575
Iz...

17:34.618 --> 17:37.056
we have to try
and move forward.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.757
- Guess I'd better
get going, then.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.367
Don't want to be late.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.202
Thanks again for doing this.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.986
Where's your sidekick?

17:55.030 --> 17:56.684
Back at school.

17:56.727 --> 17:57.989
I don't want
to get her hopes up

17:58.033 --> 18:00.079
until I know that this
is gonna lead somewhere.

18:01.254 --> 18:02.951
She's been through enough.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.042
- So I managed to get
your CPS file.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.522
Yeah.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.827
A lot of it's redacted,

18:09.871 --> 18:12.395
but it says here
you were handed over to CPS

18:12.439 --> 18:14.658
by clergy
in a church from Topanga.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.488
- Maybe somebody at the church
knows something.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.450
You know, all my life,

18:23.493 --> 18:26.975
I wondered
where I really came from,

18:27.018 --> 18:29.978
who my, uh--
my parents really are.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.634
Maybe I'll finally get
some answers to that too.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.680
Let's go find out.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.819
- Diana!

18:46.603 --> 18:48.127
Everything okay?

18:49.693 --> 18:52.174
- That picture
triggered a vision.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.741
What was it?

18:53.784 --> 18:56.004
I saw Diana.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.137
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, she was with Eve.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.965
But I--I think something
was wrong.

19:02.663 --> 19:03.838
What is it?

19:05.579 --> 19:06.841
- I don't know. I--I--

19:06.884 --> 19:09.496
I just saw fragments
of what was happening.

19:09.539 --> 19:10.845
We have to get to the church,

19:10.888 --> 19:12.586
figure out what Aldridge
wanted me to do,

19:12.629 --> 19:13.935
and then get down there.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.207
- Your people, have they
been here a long time?

19:27.992 --> 19:29.168
Forever.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.780
And you all speak English?

19:32.823 --> 19:34.738
Who taught you?

19:37.350 --> 19:39.917
- You should rest,
regain your strength.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.354
It's a long walk back
to your camp,

19:41.397 --> 19:42.746
and I can't take you there.

19:45.836 --> 19:50.101
- I don't blame you
for being wary of outsiders.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.713
Trusting them does not work out
well for your people

19:52.756 --> 19:54.584
or mine
in a few thousand years.

19:56.586 --> 19:57.935
So I've heard.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.724
Was it someone from your group
who attacked you?

20:03.767 --> 20:06.422
- Yes,
but the person who did it,

20:06.466 --> 20:08.250
she's been through a lot.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.731
The truth is...

20:10.774 --> 20:13.037
there are so many dangers
down here.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.865
Someone else in our group
was murdered.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.868
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.872
- There's an old man
from your village

20:21.916 --> 20:23.570
who has a handprint painted
on his clothes.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.788
Do you know him?

20:24.832 --> 20:27.704
Silas. Yes. Why do you ask?

20:27.748 --> 20:31.621
- Because a young girl saw him
in the woods when it happened.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.537
Silas would never do that.

20:34.581 --> 20:35.712
I'm sorry.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.366
I don't mean any offense.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.282
We're just trying to survive
long enough to get home.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.372
Is there anything,
anything you can tell us

20:43.416 --> 20:45.287
about the light in the sky?

20:45.331 --> 20:46.810
Will it come back?

20:48.247 --> 20:50.858
- No one knows why the light
comes and goes.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.219
You have a family
where you're from?

21:06.177 --> 21:08.049
It was just me and my wife.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.792
She must miss you.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.013
I'm not so sure about that.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.365
We're divorced.

21:19.408 --> 21:22.759
I actually saw her
the morning I fell down here.

21:22.803 --> 21:25.153
I haven't been feeling so well.

21:25.196 --> 21:28.330
I begged her to take me back,
make a go of it one more time.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.290
And did she agree?

21:35.424 --> 21:37.252
I'm sorry.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.172
You know what's funny?

21:44.215 --> 21:45.608
Once I knew she
was gone for good,

21:45.652 --> 21:48.742
I was pretty sure there was
nothing left to live for.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.136
But this place...

21:52.180 --> 21:54.443
it's changed
something in me.

21:56.053 --> 21:59.230
It's almost like...

21:59.274 --> 22:03.365
trying to survive has forced me
to start living again.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.978
- Our home can be
a wonderful place.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.852
It's nice to meet someone
from your world

22:11.895 --> 22:13.680
who can see beyond its dangers.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.736
What are you doing?

22:26.780 --> 22:28.695
- Digging a tunnel
to get them out that way.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.044
- I don't need to state
the obvious,

22:30.087 --> 22:31.915
but it's kind of unsafe
out here.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.700
You guys need to take cover.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.921
Whoa! Crap! That is not good.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.532
- We'll make sure
everyone's okay.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.060
Eve, this is crazy.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.670
It could take hours
to dig them out,

22:47.714 --> 22:49.411
and as much
as I hate to say it,

22:49.455 --> 22:50.804
we don't even know
if they're still alive.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.240
I'm not leaving!

22:52.283 --> 22:54.677
Listen to me. You gotta stop.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.287
I can't.

22:57.463 --> 23:00.074
- You can't be responsible
for everyone.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.032
You don't have to stay here.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.252
But I'm not going anywhere.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.837
Hey, what are you doing?

23:23.880 --> 23:26.317
Hey, you okay?

23:27.884 --> 23:29.408
What happened?

23:29.451 --> 23:32.454
- Phone pole hit the structure.
Brought it down on us.

23:33.281 --> 23:34.848
- Oh, Jesus,
we need to get out of here.

23:36.632 --> 23:37.590
I'm trying.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.117
Hey. Hey! Hey, stop!

23:43.160 --> 23:45.119
Stop! You're gonna
bring it down on us!

23:48.165 --> 23:50.733
Oh! I can see light!

23:50.777 --> 23:52.953
I can see light.

23:52.996 --> 23:55.216
- Help!
- Help!

23:55.259 --> 23:57.348
Help! Can anybody hear me?

23:58.524 --> 23:59.742
Did you hear that?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.309
Can anyone hear me?

24:01.352 --> 24:02.789
It's Marybeth. She's alive.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.880
Marybeth! Can you hear me?

24:06.923 --> 24:09.970
Yeah! We're here! We're here!

24:10.013 --> 24:11.711
Okay. Hold tight.

24:11.754 --> 24:12.799
We're gonna get you
out of here.

24:23.897 --> 24:24.288
.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.029
- Thanks for helping us,
Reverend.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.770
33 years is a long time.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.859
Luckily, Reverend Harmon
was here then.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.341
Reverend Harmon.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.649
This is Mr. Gavin Harris,

24:36.692 --> 24:39.521
the man from your past
I was telling you about.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.871
- It's nice to see you
after all these years.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.526
You remember me?

24:44.570 --> 24:46.659
- I'd only been in the church
a few weeks.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.052
A group of us were driving home
from the local food bank,

24:49.096 --> 24:52.229
and that's when we saw you
by the side of the road.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.189
On the side of the road?

24:55.232 --> 24:57.017
What was I doing there?

24:57.060 --> 24:59.019
Walking.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.325
You looked lost, scared.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.677
There was a house nearby,

25:04.720 --> 25:08.332
but the owners said they didn't
recognize you or the girl.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.728
What girl?

25:12.772 --> 25:15.426
- Oh, she was about
12 years old.

25:15.470 --> 25:18.647
Neither of you could remember
anything,

25:18.691 --> 25:20.214
even your names.

25:20.257 --> 25:22.216
- Do you know
what happened to her?

25:22.259 --> 25:23.696
I'm sorry, I don't.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.786
We called child services,
and they took the both of you.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.179
I'd hoped that you'd find
a home together,

25:29.223 --> 25:31.225
but I guess
that wasn't meant to be.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.664
I'm afraid that's all I know.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.406
Thank you, Reverend.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.063
- You have no idea
who that girl was?

25:43.106 --> 25:45.587
- No. I don't remember
anything before my adoption.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.415
But if Aldridge is pointing me
toward the girl,

25:47.458 --> 25:50.244
maybe she knows something.
Maybe she can help.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.812
- I'll call my contact at CPS,
see if we can get a name.

25:52.855 --> 25:53.943
Yeah.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.467
Quick, let's get inside.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.382
- There's gotta be
something useful in there.

26:03.910 --> 26:04.998
You're kidding me.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.173
- Something tells me
we're not gonna

26:06.216 --> 26:08.436
find a jackhammer in here.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.785
They're costumes.

26:11.178 --> 26:14.834
This is a wardrobe truck.
You know, like for a movie.

26:14.877 --> 26:18.751
Oh, my God, something warm.
Thank you, Lord.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.927
- We should go back out there,
look somewhere else.

26:22.929 --> 26:25.540
- Scott was right.
The storm is getting worse.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.715
The only thing we're gonna
accomplish out there

26:26.759 --> 26:28.369
is getting ourselves killed.

26:28.412 --> 26:29.500
- You want to stay,
I don't blame you,

26:29.544 --> 26:30.545
but I'm going.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.634
Josh, I get you're pissed

26:32.678 --> 26:34.070
at your mom and you want
to prove yourself.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.768
That's not what I'm doing.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.857
- Have you ever considered that
maybe you should be grateful?

26:39.728 --> 26:41.774
You have a parent who loves you
so much, she's willing

26:41.817 --> 26:44.777
to sabotage our way home
just to protect you.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.561
- Why are you defending her?
I thought you hated her.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.476
- I was upset
when she left my dad.

26:48.519 --> 26:51.435
But we've been through a lot
the last few days.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.786
The point is,
she's clearly a good mom.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.310
And you're stupid
if you don't see that.

26:58.138 --> 27:00.619
I'm staying in here
till the storm dies down.

27:01.358 --> 27:02.969
I hope you do too.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.542
Damn it!

27:11.586 --> 27:12.718
What the hell
are they doing up there?

27:12.761 --> 27:13.936
Trying to get us out.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.068
- Yeah, well, they need
to try harder.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.334
You okay? You hurt?

27:20.377 --> 27:22.336
- I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.689
- Okay. Okay. You never
did like small spaces,

27:27.733 --> 27:29.560
even as a little kid.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.171
Wouldn't even ride
in an elevator.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.912
- But hey--

27:34.740 --> 27:36.872
Remember the exercise
we used to do?

27:36.916 --> 27:39.701
When we absolutely had to be
in a small space?

27:40.876 --> 27:42.704
Focus on one thing you can see.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.488
I'm not some scared kid.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.360
One thing you can see.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.976
Good. Breathe.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.938
Now focus on something
you can touch.

28:07.076 --> 28:09.426
Now focus on something
you can hear.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.516
Come on.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.996
There's got to be something
you can hear right now.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.085
- Can't hear anything
with you yapping away.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.002
- Glad to see you're feeling
like yourself again.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.969
Lucas...

28:30.012 --> 28:31.884
we need to talk
about your dad.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.018
- I don't want
to talk about him.

28:36.062 --> 28:39.326
- Well, we are.

28:39.369 --> 28:40.849
We may not have much time left.

28:40.893 --> 28:43.765
There are things
you need to know.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.899
And everything I did,
I did to protect you.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.988
Stop lying.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.772
I'm not lying.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.383
I'm trying to finally
tell you the truth.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.779
What the hell?

29:02.262 --> 29:04.177
Eve! Eve!

29:04.220 --> 29:06.962
- I'm here. I'm here.
We're moving as fast as we can.

29:08.659 --> 29:11.619
- Jesus! Well, move faster!
This thing's about to collapse!

29:14.448 --> 29:16.276
No.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.149
Get us out of here now!

29:27.330 --> 29:27.548
.

29:27.591 --> 29:30.290
- Okay.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.086
Thank you. Thank you so much.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.392
Okay.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.525
Okay, I've got
some people making calls.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.701
Hopefully, we hear back soon.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.225
- I can't thank you enough,
Sophia.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.793
- Oh, we've both
got people down there.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.277
Diana! She's gone.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.152
What is it?

30:09.459 --> 30:11.070
I saw Diana again.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.986
And?

30:19.426 --> 30:20.775
Huh.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.344
She's dead, isn't she?

30:33.266 --> 30:35.007
How?

30:35.050 --> 30:36.922
I didn't see.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.361
Sophia, I'm--

30:41.404 --> 30:43.929
I'm so sorry.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.904
- The wind must've
destabilized it.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.166
This whole thing's
about to come down.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.733
We have to get them now.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.126
How?

31:07.169 --> 31:09.606
- Remember how they opened
the hatch on "Lost"?

31:09.650 --> 31:11.434
They used old dynamite
they found on the island.

31:11.478 --> 31:14.046
Then "Bam!"
Blew it right open.

31:16.004 --> 31:17.310
I'll shut up now.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.706
- That's actually
not a bad idea.

31:22.750 --> 31:23.969
It isn't?

31:34.153 --> 31:35.545
What are you doing?

31:35.589 --> 31:37.069
I'm making an IED.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.244
It'll blow a hole
in the concrete.

31:38.287 --> 31:39.593
Then we can pull them out.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.290
- I can't believe you're
actually listening to me.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.813
- Well, have you made
one before?

31:42.857 --> 31:45.468
- No. But I've dismantled
a few in my day.

31:45.512 --> 31:48.950
We'll use the electricity from
the defib as a power supply.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.039
These wires
will bring the charge.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.736
All we need is an explosive.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.565
- Like, uh--like gunpowder.

31:55.609 --> 31:56.958
That's perfect.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.314
- Not that I don't appreciate
the whole

32:05.358 --> 32:06.750
"MacGyver" thing
that's going on here,

32:06.794 --> 32:09.753
but when you say "IED,"
I get a little nervous.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.451
- Yeah, I-I have to agree.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.192
How do you know
that won't kill them?

32:14.715 --> 32:16.064
I don't.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.505
- What the hell?

32:25.117 --> 32:26.988
Lucas, you were right.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.557
I didn't kill your father
in self-defense.

32:32.472 --> 32:33.864
I knew it.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.431
I did it to save you.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.173
I know why you loved him.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.655
I loved him too.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.788
He was funny and charming...

32:44.832 --> 32:46.268
and could make you feel
like the most important

32:46.312 --> 32:48.357
person in the world, but...

32:50.011 --> 32:51.970
That wasn't real.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.103
When I found out
what he was doing,

32:55.147 --> 32:56.496
the worst part wasn't

32:56.539 --> 32:59.020
that he was stealing drugs
from the department.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.066
It was that he got you
mixed up in it.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.940
- So that's why you killed him?
Because he was working with me?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.029
No. I was gonna turn him in.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.162
But IA was onto him,
and he knew it.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.685
Time I figured it out,

33:11.728 --> 33:13.948
he'd already used all his
connections to cut a deal.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.081
What deal?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.040
The one to give you up.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.479
He laid it all at your feet,

33:23.523 --> 33:25.003
said you were
behind everything.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.482
He was gonna go free.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.572
You were gonna spend the rest
of your life in a cage.

33:29.616 --> 33:31.400
No.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.707
No, he wouldn't do that to me.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.969
He had it all set up.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.536
I begged him
not to go through with it.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.407
Reminded him what it would do
to you to be locked up.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.061
It would've--it would've
been a death sentence.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.889
But he wouldn't listen.

33:41.932 --> 33:45.458
Son, he was gonna sacrifice
your life for himself.

33:45.501 --> 33:46.720
No.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.461
- He was on his way
to turn you in, Lucas.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.071
- No, he--
- I had to stop him.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.420
Well, if that's true,

33:51.464 --> 33:52.900
then why wouldn't you
tell me before this?

33:52.943 --> 33:54.684
When, huh?

33:54.728 --> 33:56.295
You haven't wanted
to hear anything I had to say

33:56.338 --> 33:58.079
since you were, what, 15?

34:01.300 --> 34:03.954
And I knew that
when you found out the truth,

34:03.998 --> 34:05.739
it was gonna break your heart.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.918
Because when I found out...

34:10.961 --> 34:12.572
it broke mine.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.837
Why should I believe a word
you're saying?

34:16.880 --> 34:19.100
Look where we are.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.668
I got no reason to lie.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.064
- Marybeth!
- Listen to me.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.849
We're gonna use an IED to blow
a hole through the concrete.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.720
Then we'll pull you out.

34:30.764 --> 34:31.895
Hold on. What?

34:31.939 --> 34:33.332
- No. Are you insane?
You'll kill us.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.377
- Just stay as far back
as you can.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.864
- This is it!
Everybody get back.

35:09.063 --> 35:09.194
.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.464
Marybeth! Lucas!

35:21.684 --> 35:23.295
Come on. Come on.

35:23.338 --> 35:25.079
We're here. We're okay.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.126
Come here. Come on.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.518
- It's gonna collapse!

35:29.562 --> 35:31.216
Come on. Come on. Go, go, go!

35:36.395 --> 35:38.179
That was uncomfortably close.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.361
- God, I can't believe
our lives have come to this.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.628
Can I ask you something?

35:55.022 --> 35:57.372
Why'd you drop out of premed?

35:57.416 --> 35:59.026
That's your question?

35:59.069 --> 36:02.290
- You're really smart,
good under pressure.

36:02.334 --> 36:05.728
Even though you don't have
the best...bedside manner.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.819
- I think you'd be
a really good doctor.

36:17.131 --> 36:20.830
- Honestly, I don't know
what I want to do with my life.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.008
But I do know
I want the choice to be mine.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.707
I get that.

36:31.493 --> 36:34.540
You know,
before all this happened,

36:34.583 --> 36:37.630
I was sending out
my college applications.

36:37.673 --> 36:40.981
My top choice was UCLA.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.288
Mm.

36:44.941 --> 36:48.118
- I wonder if we would've
ran into each other on campus.

36:48.162 --> 36:50.686
- Oh, I don't usually
talk to freshmen.

36:53.472 --> 36:54.995
I'm kidding.

36:57.824 --> 37:00.348
I would've made
an exception for you.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.013
- Wait.
- What?

37:14.319 --> 37:15.537
Do you hear that?

37:15.581 --> 37:17.104
I didn't hear anything.

37:18.410 --> 37:19.715
The wind stopped.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.375
Come on.
Let's get the hell out of here.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.379
Great.

37:44.174 --> 37:48.004
- We got a name on the girl.
Ella Jones. She's an artist.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.398
Only have an address
for her gallery in Silver Lake.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.228
Thank you, Sophia.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.101
I'll drop you home,
and I'll--I'll head over.

37:59.929 --> 38:02.236
- It was only home if Diana
was gonna be there.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.110
I'm coming with you.

38:08.590 --> 38:09.896
You don't have to do that.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.245
Yes, I do.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.901
Diana was the strongest person
I've ever known.

38:14.944 --> 38:17.817
She wouldn't have given up,
and neither can I.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.778
We have to bring everyone home.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.923
I don't think anybody's here.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.102
Gavin, look.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.408
Come on.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.113
Hello?

38:58.118 --> 38:59.424
I can't believe it.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.078
What?

39:02.122 --> 39:05.255
- I've seen this before
in my visions.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.867
<i>It's a handprint.</i>

39:07.910 --> 39:10.913
Whoever Ella is...

39:10.957 --> 39:12.959
she's connected to that place.

39:17.093 --> 39:18.791
How do you feel?

39:18.834 --> 39:20.575
Better.

39:21.533 --> 39:25.275
If there's ever anything I can
do to repay your kindness...

39:25.319 --> 39:26.451
No need.

39:33.588 --> 39:35.329
I still don't know your name.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.114
It's Paara.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.423
Good luck, Ty.

39:47.907 --> 39:49.343
Wait.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.826
You don't know your way.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.177
No, I suppose I don't.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.485
Maybe you could point me
in the right direction?

40:01.660 --> 40:04.010
Maybe I can.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.371
About time, buddy.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.329
- We got caught in the storm.
Couldn't find any tools.

40:19.373 --> 40:20.853
- Looks like Marybeth and Lucas
are okay.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.202
They are.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.639
We got them out on our own,
thanks to Eve.

40:29.165 --> 40:30.645
Saved our asses.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.342
It was a group effort.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.955
Whoa. Score.

40:35.998 --> 40:37.522
Where did you find all of this?

40:37.565 --> 40:39.480
- That 18-wheeler was actually
a wardrobe truck.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.351
Considering it's getting
pretty damn cold around here,

40:41.395 --> 40:43.397
we thought we might need
a few more jackets.

40:49.534 --> 40:54.147
- Mom, I know you're upset,
and you have every right to be.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.195
I'm sorry.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.766
- Hey, I'm--I'm gonna head out.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.768
You're gonna have to take care
of yourself for a little while.

41:06.812 --> 41:10.076
No way. You're not leaving.

41:10.119 --> 41:13.471
Guys, I say we take a new vote.

41:16.691 --> 41:19.215
- I agree.
- Me too.

41:19.259 --> 41:20.956
- Only if Marybeth
gives up that gun.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.873
Seriously?

41:24.917 --> 41:26.701
You guys are unbelievable.

41:26.745 --> 41:30.009
Hey, come on. Just...

41:30.052 --> 41:31.924
hand over the gun.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.753
- Yeah, come on.
It's the right thing to do.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.195
Thanks.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.284
Well done. Well done.

41:44.327 --> 41:47.548
- Now, all in favor
of Eve and Marybeth

41:47.592 --> 41:50.856
staying in the clearing,
raise your hands.
