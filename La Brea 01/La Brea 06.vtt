WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:02.306
.

00:07.529 --> 00:10.053
- Lilly, is there something
else you want to say?

00:10.097 --> 00:11.228
- It was Aaron and Veronica.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.839
They took me.
She's not my sister.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.102
- Veronica, wait!

00:15.145 --> 00:16.625
<i>- Looks like
some kind of temple. </i>

00:16.668 --> 00:18.148
Long-range walkie-talkie.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.758
<i>This is what my radar
was picking up. </i>

00:19.802 --> 00:21.673
- You really think whoever's
on the other end of that

00:21.717 --> 00:23.501
can help us fix your plane?
- They flew down here.

00:23.545 --> 00:24.981
Maybe they have parts
we can use.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.243
Gavin's visions are real.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.115
Everything that he's seen
these past few years

00:28.158 --> 00:30.160
have been glimpses
of this world.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.032
- When will we leave?
- Tonight.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.685
- What is this place?

00:33.729 --> 00:36.253
- This is where the survivors
of the La Brea sinkhole settled

00:36.297 --> 00:37.820
in 10,000 B.C.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.346
<i>- "Gavin, tonight, the light
that connects our worlds </i>

00:42.390 --> 00:44.392
<i>"started to close.</i>

00:44.435 --> 00:45.654
<i>"Just know that,
in my heart, </i>

00:45.697 --> 00:47.873
<i>"I am so sorry
for doubting you. </i>

00:47.917 --> 00:49.484
<i>I should have believed you
all along." </i>

01:20.776 --> 01:23.300
- Eve. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Please. Whoa.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.476
Hey, can we talk about this?
- We already have.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.652
We both agreed that if things
weren't better by now,

01:27.696 --> 01:29.654
that the kids and I were gonna
spend the summer in LA.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.221
- Okay, we did.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.571
But I changed my mind.

01:33.615 --> 01:36.400
- Gavin.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.488
- You're breaking up
our family?

01:37.532 --> 01:39.229
- Don't put this on me.

01:39.273 --> 01:42.276
You haven't been sober for over
a week in the last three years.

01:42.319 --> 01:44.234
The kids deserve better.
I deserve better.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.671
- You're--you're right.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.934
Just--just tell me
what I have to do.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.110
Tell me what you need from me.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.199
- I need--

01:52.242 --> 01:54.070
I need my husband back.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.767
I need the man
I fell in love with.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.988
I need the--the person
who always made me feel safe.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.642
- I want that too.

02:00.685 --> 02:04.036
Eve, if I could just figure out
what these things are I see,

02:04.080 --> 02:07.823
why they're happening to me,
then I can turn it around.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.608
You just have to trust me.

02:10.652 --> 02:11.783
- I got to go.

02:11.827 --> 02:12.915
I got to go get the kids.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.224
- Hey.

02:17.267 --> 02:20.879
Eve, I'm gonna find my way
back to you.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.316
I promise.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.685
- Scott, what are you doing?

02:43.728 --> 02:46.166
- Trying to calculate how long
until that light's gone.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.472
- With your finger?
- Take a look.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.344
It started closing
about three hours ago, right?

02:50.387 --> 02:51.649
Well, since then,

02:51.693 --> 02:54.086
it's gotten smaller
by one of my fingernails.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.001
My index finger is
about seven fingernails long.

02:56.045 --> 02:59.179
So by that calculation,
we got about 18 hours left

02:59.222 --> 03:01.311
until we're stuck
down here forever.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.531
- I really wish
I hadn't asked.

03:03.574 --> 03:06.011
- So you're telling me
Lilly was kidnapped?

03:06.055 --> 03:07.665
- That's right.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.232
- We have to talk to Veronica.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.408
- I tried.
She ran off into the woods.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.323
And if she doesn't
come back soon,

03:13.367 --> 03:14.803
we have to go look for her.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.718
- Oh, hey.
You think that's a good idea?

03:16.761 --> 03:19.024
There's a seriously
pissed off group of locals

03:19.068 --> 03:20.504
who aren't happy
we're down here.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.202
- We can't just leave her
out there by herself.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.421
- I agree,
but right now,

03:24.465 --> 03:27.642
our top priority
needs to be getting home.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.209
- Mom.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.036
- The light's closing.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.038
Everyone's freaking out.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.214
What are we gonna do?

03:34.257 --> 03:35.476
- I don't know.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.086
But we're not
gonna give up, okay?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.218
We're gonna find a way home.

03:41.003 --> 03:43.048
- What's going on?

03:45.747 --> 03:48.010
I wrote a letter
to your dad and Izzy.

03:48.053 --> 03:52.667
And--and I buried it,
hoping they would find it,

03:52.710 --> 03:54.321
let everybody know we're alive,

03:54.364 --> 03:56.410
send another plane
before the portal closes.

03:56.453 --> 03:57.759
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.543
Um, Josh, there's something
I need you to know

03:59.587 --> 04:02.590
about your dad
and the things he sees.

04:06.158 --> 04:10.162
They're real.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.252
And he can see us here.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.210
- You think Dad can see us?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.472
- I know it's hard
to believe, but--

04:15.516 --> 04:16.517
- Yeah, 'cause it's insane.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.780
- I thought so too.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.216
But it's true.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.522
- Even if it is,
when's the last time

04:21.565 --> 04:24.438
he came through for us
on anything?

04:26.701 --> 04:29.312
- This is Levi Delgado
of the United States Air Force.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.096
If anyone can hear this,
please respond.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.146
- Oh, man.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.800
Why bother?

04:38.843 --> 04:40.236
- I say again,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.499
this is Captain Levi Delgado
of the U.S. Air Force.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.458
If anyone can hear this,
please respond.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.166
<i>- Hello?</i>

04:57.209 --> 04:59.951
<i>Jonathan, is that you?</i>

04:59.995 --> 05:01.866
- Hello.
This is Captain Levi Delgado.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.955
Who is this?

05:03.999 --> 05:06.436
<i>- This is First Sergeant
Engineer Diana Hoskins, </i>

05:06.480 --> 05:09.309
<i>United States Air Force.</i>

05:09.352 --> 05:11.702
- We got something!
We got something!

05:17.882 --> 05:19.841
- Quiet, quiet!
- Quiet! Shh!

05:19.884 --> 05:23.279
<i>- That--that radio belonged
to my friend. </i>

05:23.323 --> 05:25.455
<i>Is he with you?</i>

05:25.499 --> 05:27.762
- I'm sorry, but your friend
didn't make it.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.809
Diana, I know
about the Mojave mission.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.115
I was sent here
to rescue you,

05:33.158 --> 05:35.639
but my plane crashed
and my engine's damaged.

05:35.683 --> 05:38.381
I need to repair it.
Can you help me?

05:41.819 --> 05:42.951
<i>- Maybe.</i>

05:42.994 --> 05:45.345
<i>I'm in Santa Monica,
on the beach. </i>

05:45.388 --> 05:47.564
- Did she say Santa Monica?
- Shh.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.742
- Diana, you're breaking up.
Can you say again?

05:51.786 --> 05:54.310
<i>- Near a large
rock formation-- </i>

05:57.444 --> 05:59.315
- Diana?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.883
Hello? Hello?

06:03.972 --> 06:04.973
I lost the signal.

06:08.237 --> 06:09.586
I need to go find her.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.588
- She said Santa Monica.
That's miles away.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.763
- The light
could be gone by then.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.199
- Yeah.
- You can take the Jeep.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.331
I finally got it started.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.419
- Then we leave now.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.682
- I'm going with you.

06:18.726 --> 06:19.814
- Wait, wait. Hold on.
It's not like

06:19.857 --> 06:21.250
you can just hop on the ten.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.251
How are you gonna get there?

06:22.294 --> 06:23.383
- Compass and the stars.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.732
Just like they taught us
in basic.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.081
- For what it's worth,
I'm pretty sure

06:26.124 --> 06:27.691
it's mostly flat wetlands
to the ocean.

06:27.735 --> 06:30.215
so, you know,
if you can avoid a saber-tooth,

06:30.259 --> 06:31.652
you should be good.

06:31.695 --> 06:34.045
- Let's get going.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.657
- Mom.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.007
- Josh, I know we still have
a lot to talk about.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.141
- Just be careful.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.056
- We're gonna get out of here.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.293
- Oh, hey. Look.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.816
Look, Levi.
There it is.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.949
That's the rock formation.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.170
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.579
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.150
- Turn around slowly.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.982
- Diana, it's okay.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.724
I'm Levi, and this is Eve.
We spoke on the walkie.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.117
- What did you do to Jonathan?
- We didn't do anything.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.033
- Don't lie to me!
- I'm not lying to you.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.993
We found him in a fort
deep in the forest.

07:52.036 --> 07:54.212
He was dead
when we got there.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.954
- Diana, I need
to show you something.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.869
I'm gonna reach
in my pocket, okay?

08:04.266 --> 08:08.183
Diana, this is you
and the Mojave team.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.189
- Where did you get that?

08:14.232 --> 08:16.931
- Dr. Sophia Nathan
gave it to me.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.590
- Sorry.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.115
You spend enough time
down here,

08:27.158 --> 08:30.553
you learn to see everything
as a threat.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.991
- You said you might be able
to fix our plane.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.820
Do you think
it's still possible?

08:36.864 --> 08:38.343
- Maybe.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.519
Come with me.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.698
- I was told that you and your
team came through the Mojave.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.308
How did you end up
in Los Angeles?

08:46.351 --> 08:48.005
- The portal
we came in through closed,

08:48.049 --> 08:50.007
so we went looking
for another way out.

08:50.051 --> 08:53.881
But we got caught in the storm,
crashed on the beach.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.666
Two of our crew died,
including our pilot.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.015
- What about
the rest of them?

08:58.059 --> 08:59.974
- We split up, trying
to find another way home.

09:00.017 --> 09:02.367
Eventually, Jonathan and I
settled here.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.760
And when we saw
your plane come down,

09:03.804 --> 09:06.937
he went looking for you,
but he never came back.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.200
You said
your engine was damaged.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.724
Have you identified
the problem?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.508
- Bleeding air
from the compressor.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.640
- You check the axial?

09:13.683 --> 09:15.424
- Uh-huh.

09:15.467 --> 09:19.036
- Must be the pneumatic system.
That's good news.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.999
Ours is still intact.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.696
I think I can fix your plane.

09:32.528 --> 09:36.967
.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.622
- Gavin, we need
to get to my plane now.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.757
- Please, go save them.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.846
- That's not gonna happen.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.157
So you found the clearing,
Rebecca.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.596
Care to explain
how you did that?

09:56.639 --> 09:57.640
- Not really.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.902
And this is
private property,

09:58.946 --> 10:00.425
so I hope
you have a warrant.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.127
- I told you
to let this go.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.694
- The light in the sinkhole
is closing.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.521
- I know.
We've been tracking it.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.654
- Then you'll know that,
by tomorrow, it'll be gone.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.395
Okay? We still have time
to save 'em.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.791
- Dr. Aldridge.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.140
We found something.

10:19.183 --> 10:22.447
And trust me,
you're gonna wanna see this.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.807
The wreckage just appeared

10:33.850 --> 10:35.678
in a section of the clearing
we already excavated.

10:35.722 --> 10:36.810
- What does he mean
just appeared?

10:36.853 --> 10:38.159
- What kind of wreckage?

10:38.202 --> 10:39.377
- A plane.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.477
- That's Levi's plane.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.218
- Jesus, you're right.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.872
But he flew down
two days ago.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.179
Why did it just appear?
- Good question.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.485
Do we have GPR
in the area?

11:00.529 --> 11:01.922
- Yeah.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.315
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

11:04.359 --> 11:06.927
- This is
ground-penetrating radar.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.277
There are multiple bodies.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.845
- Levi must have tried
to fix the plane,

11:11.888 --> 11:13.455
tried to fly 'em home.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.717
But they didn't make it.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.153
- Dad.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.503
Dad, what if--what if
Mom and Josh were on it?

11:18.547 --> 11:19.766
What if we're too late?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.855
- Just yesterday,
I saw them alive, all right?

11:21.898 --> 11:24.031
Maybe they haven't left yet.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.859
I think we can still save 'em.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.730
Rebecca has a plane.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.731
You have to let me try.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.515
- Gavin, stop.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.736
Arrest him.
- What?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.042
- Hey. Get off!
Get off!

11:35.085 --> 11:36.521
- Stop. What are you doing?!
- Stand down.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.872
- Gavin, I'm sorry,
but if something goes wrong

11:38.915 --> 11:41.570
and there's another earthquake,
people will die.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.441
It's over, Gavin.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.146
- Good morning.

11:54.452 --> 11:57.325
- Did Veronica come back?

11:57.368 --> 11:58.456
- She didn't.

12:05.333 --> 12:09.511
You're, um, worried about her,
aren't you?

12:11.252 --> 12:15.125
- When Aaron took me,
I was so scared.

12:15.169 --> 12:19.216
But Veronica was nice to me.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.783
At night,

12:20.827 --> 12:23.786
he kept us
in a room together.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.484
She was the only person
I could talk to.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.790
- Lilly.

12:30.314 --> 12:34.579
Are you saying that
Aaron kidnapped Veronica too?

12:34.623 --> 12:37.539
- Yes.

12:37.582 --> 12:40.847
She's not a bad person.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.805
We need to find her, Ty.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.422
- Mom.
- Josh.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.166
Everybody, this is Diana.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.994
- Good to meet you all.

13:00.127 --> 13:03.565
- So we have a chance
of getting out of here?

13:03.608 --> 13:05.915
- It's possible.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.438
- I knew I liked you
the moment you arrived.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.397
- Hold on.
I'm not making any promises.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.051
Diana's an engineer.
We're gonna head back

13:11.094 --> 13:12.443
to my plane,
see if we can get it going.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.968
I'm gonna grab some MREs.
I'll be right back.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.578
- How long have you
been down here?

13:16.621 --> 13:19.711
- 1,123 days.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.017
Give or take a few.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.239
- Do you know how long we have
till light goes away?

13:25.282 --> 13:26.893
- The one that
I came in through,

13:26.936 --> 13:28.198
once it started to close,

13:28.242 --> 13:30.331
it was gone
in less than 24 hours.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.815
- That puts it
at nightfall.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.512
- All right.
We're ready.

13:37.555 --> 13:40.036
- Okay.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.951
- Plane's a lot closer
than the beach,

13:41.995 --> 13:43.344
so we shouldn't
have connection issues.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.736
- Good.
- I'll call you

13:44.780 --> 13:46.869
as soon
as we have any news.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.009
- Look, I know
we're all anxious,

13:56.052 --> 13:57.532
but we need to be
prepared to leave

13:57.575 --> 13:59.403
as soon as Levi says
his plane is ready.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.971
- Don't have to tell me twice.
I'll be ready to go.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.365
- Who says you're going first?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.889
- You trying to take my seat?
Go on.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.543
See where that gets you.
- Hey.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.414
I'm not getting left behind.
- All right, enough.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.373
Nobody said anything
about anyone being left behind.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.201
- Look, we need
to be smart about this.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.680
Fair.
- Sam's right.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.508
There's not enough room
for all of us on the plane,

14:17.552 --> 14:19.554
so we're gonna have
to take multiple trips.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.645
All right.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.212
I say we draw names.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.170
It's the best option
we have right now.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.914
- All right. Everybody
write down their name.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.568
We need to start picking now.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.575
- Hey.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.707
You okay, sweetheart?

14:42.751 --> 14:44.405
- Dad, if that light closes,

14:44.448 --> 14:47.060
Mom and Josh are
stuck down there forever.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.626
- I'm not gonna
let that happen.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.501
Aldridge, let me
ask you a question.

14:53.544 --> 14:56.243
How did you know
where the clearing was?

14:56.286 --> 14:58.941
- Gavin, that's not important
right now.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.421
- She's full of crap, Dad.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.814
- This isn't
how I wanted it to go, Izzy.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.991
- How did you want it to go?

15:05.034 --> 15:07.123
What else are you
hiding from us?

15:12.172 --> 15:13.651
Finally.
Where have you been?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.392
- Working on a way
to get you out of here.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.481
- How?
- Markman was onto me.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.440
I had to make him think
that I was on his side.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.050
- You were the one
who gave us up.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.574
- It was my only option.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.012
If I didn't,
they'd have Rebecca's plane

15:26.055 --> 15:27.622
and we'd have no way
of getting down there.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.015
- So what's your play?

15:29.058 --> 15:31.321
- I told Markman about
your compound in Oregon.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.757
That's where he thinks
the plane is.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.150
- Well done.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.804
- How long until he figures out
it's not there?

15:35.847 --> 15:37.327
- A couple of hours.
And we need to get you

15:37.371 --> 15:38.763
to the ranch
before that happens.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.983
My car's not far from here,
and I can sneak you out.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.550
- My helicopter's ready to go.
- Hold on.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.421
I need to get word down
to Eve and Levi,

15:44.465 --> 15:46.032
tell them
his plane's gonna crash.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.468
- Gavin, there really
isn't any time left.

15:47.511 --> 15:48.904
- He could take off
at any moment.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.558
I have to warn them.

15:53.256 --> 15:56.390
There has to be a way
to get a message down there.

16:01.177 --> 16:04.485
- And the next one is...

16:04.528 --> 16:05.703
- Angela O'Brien.

16:07.227 --> 16:10.839
- Okay. We got two more slots
for the first flight.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.059
Next one goes to...

16:13.102 --> 16:14.408
- Josh Harris.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.453
- Seriously, I better be
in that seat next to you.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.324
- Yeah.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.021
- Come on.
- Come on.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.284
- And the last spot
goes to...

16:23.243 --> 16:25.027
Lucas Hayes.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.073
- Nice pick, Eve.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.900
Much appreciated.
- No way. No way, nah.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.206
To hell with that.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.034
Yeah, I mean,
Eve just chose her son.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.601
I say we start over, huh?
- Oh, come on.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.559
That's ridiculous.
- You want to start over?

16:35.603 --> 16:38.084
- No one is repicking anything.
- Shock you'd say that.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.346
Your son's
in the first flight too.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.522
- Look, this is
how we're doing it.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.959
It's not perfect, but
it's the only choice we have.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.527
Everyone just take five.
Go for a walk, grab a drink.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.137
Then we pick the next flight.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.230
- Eve.
- Ty.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.580
You going somewhere?
- Yeah.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.105
Veronica's gone missing.
I need to go and find out.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.325
- Ty, you can't do this alone.
You know it's too dangerous.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.414
- Look, I--I asked the guys
to look after Lilly

17:04.458 --> 17:07.722
while I'm gone,
but if anything happens to me,

17:07.765 --> 17:10.029
I just want you to make sure
she gets back to her family.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.900
Okay?

17:11.943 --> 17:13.380
Goodbye, Eve.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.816
Just take good care
of yourself, okay?

17:14.859 --> 17:16.731
- All right, listen,
if you don't find Veronica

17:16.774 --> 17:19.212
in the next couple of hours,
you get back here.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.822
Do you hear me?
- Yes.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.346
- Okay. I'm gonna take
the last flight out.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.739
I'll save a seat for you.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.090
- All right.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.223
- Be careful.
- I will.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.404
- Hey. Come on.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.188
- Wait, they're about
to pick the next flight.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.407
- They'll save your spot.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.930
I'm not leaving my stash
out there, man.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.497
It's worth too much.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.542
And don't tell me you don't
remember where you buried it.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.197
You smoke weed.
You don't have amnesia.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.590
Now which way did you go?

17:49.633 --> 17:51.374
- Well, it was that way,
but I don't really think--

17:51.418 --> 17:53.246
- Okay, good.
Come on.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.769
We don't have much time.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.379
Let's go.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.308
- System's reading
the new compressor.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.136
- Looks good so far.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.790
- Just need a minute
to calibrate.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.923
- That's another 60 seconds
after all these years, right?

18:23.711 --> 18:24.886
You okay?

18:24.929 --> 18:27.584
- Yeah. I--I think
I just need a minute.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.121
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.426
- What's going on?

18:43.470 --> 18:45.298
- Anxious, I guess.

18:48.214 --> 18:52.696
You--you mentioned
Sophia Nathan.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.481
So you met her?

18:57.223 --> 18:59.877
How was she?

18:59.921 --> 19:04.099
I mean, did she seem well?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.361
- She did.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.280
You two were together?

19:11.324 --> 19:13.413
- We were engaged.

19:15.328 --> 19:18.853
These last few years, all I've
wanted is to get back to her.

19:18.896 --> 19:19.984
And now that I might--

19:20.028 --> 19:21.551
- You're afraid she moved on.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.210
- The day
before I came down here,

19:28.254 --> 19:29.951
we were making wedding plans.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.216
We were gonna get married
on the beach.

19:36.349 --> 19:39.526
I've thought
about that every day.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.659
- She probably has too.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.357
In my experience,
doesn't matter

19:44.400 --> 19:48.230
how long you've been away
from the person you love.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.015
Those feelings never change.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.414
Looks like the compressor's
working just fine.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.808
- Can't believe it.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.462
We're going home.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.338
<i>- Eve, you copy?</i>

20:09.382 --> 20:11.645
<i>Hey, Eve, you copy?</i>

20:11.688 --> 20:13.342
- This is Eve.
I copy.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.648
<i>- The engine's fixed.</i>

20:14.691 --> 20:16.127
We're getting out of here.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.875
- We got one hell of a story
to tell Mom and Andrew.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.704
- I can't believe it.
- I know. I know.

20:32.448 --> 20:35.364
- Uh, what the hell is that?

20:41.283 --> 20:44.112
.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.244
- It's up there.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.902
- Uncle Levi.
- What was that?

20:51.946 --> 20:53.904
- I think it's a drone.
It looks military.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.471
- Maybe instead of
crashing drones down here,

20:55.515 --> 20:57.256
they could actually
send some more help.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.909
- They were using them
to monitor the sinkhole.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.041
One must have fall through.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.263
- Wait a minute.
Hold on.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.005
Look at this.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.358
- Let me see.

21:17.188 --> 21:19.321
- I'm getting real
"Hunger Games" vibes right now.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.067
- What does it say?

21:26.110 --> 21:28.287
- "Press play."

21:31.768 --> 21:33.814
<i>- Eve.</i>

21:33.857 --> 21:36.338
<i>I got your letter.</i>

21:36.382 --> 21:38.775
<i>I know the portal between
our two worlds is closing. </i>

21:38.819 --> 21:42.170
<i>And I know you're trying to
fix Levi's plane to get home. </i>

21:42.213 --> 21:44.085
<i>But it won't work.</i>

21:46.261 --> 21:49.612
<i>We found the wreckage
from Levi's plane. </i>

21:49.656 --> 21:51.048
- There's no way.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.572
<i>- I don't know
what went wrong. </i>

21:52.615 --> 21:55.792
<i>I just know
you won't make it. </i>

21:55.836 --> 21:58.404
<i>I need you to promise me,</i>

21:58.447 --> 22:02.712
<i>no matter what, you won't
let that plane take off. </i>

22:02.756 --> 22:04.366
<i>I know it's a lot to ask</i>

22:04.410 --> 22:08.414
<i>and I know it must feel like
it's your only way back to us, </i>

22:08.457 --> 22:09.980
<i>but it's not.</i>

22:12.026 --> 22:14.985
<i>You asked me for help.</i>

22:15.029 --> 22:17.336
<i>I have a plane.</i>

22:17.379 --> 22:21.427
<i>And I'm coming for you,
for Josh, </i>

22:21.470 --> 22:23.994
<i>for everyone.</i>

22:24.038 --> 22:26.780
<i>I won't let you down.</i>

22:26.823 --> 22:28.999
<i>I just need you to trust me.</i>

22:33.700 --> 22:35.354
- Dude, something just
fell out of the sky.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.920
Aren't you the least bit
curious about it?

22:36.964 --> 22:39.706
- No. Keep going.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.926
- Your mom's a cop.
I hear they get good pensions.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.711
Maybe can she give you
a loan or something?

22:44.754 --> 22:46.756
- Not an option.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.585
- Go on, then.
- Okay. Okay.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.413
Borrowing money from family
can be tricky.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.110
I get it.

22:53.154 --> 22:54.938
Clearly, you got a lot
to work out with your mom,

22:54.982 --> 22:57.201
I mean, with you being on the
other side of the law and all.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.594
Hey. No judgment here.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.335
I mean, I'm the black sheep
of my family too.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.858
Obviously,
for different reasons.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.686
- You think
I'm the black sheep?

23:03.730 --> 23:05.035
- Aren't you?

23:05.079 --> 23:08.212
- Let's just say,
what I do is family business.

23:08.256 --> 23:10.389
My dad and I,
we're partners.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.653
- Wait, you and your dad
are drug dealers?

23:13.696 --> 23:16.656
Wow. Your mom's, like,
the worst cop ever.

23:16.699 --> 23:20.834
- We're done talking.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.009
What are you doing?

23:24.707 --> 23:27.536
- Well, I was stoned when
I came out here the first time.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.233
Maybe if I got myself
in the same state of mind,

23:29.277 --> 23:30.887
I might remember something.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.716
- That's actually
not a bad idea.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.849
Do you mind if--
- Of course.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.807
- Thanks.

23:37.851 --> 23:40.636
Stop being an idiot!

23:40.680 --> 23:42.421
- What the hell, man?

23:46.555 --> 23:48.165
Wait a minute.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.431
Hey, this is it.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.433
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.304
Yeah, I buried it
around here.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.349
I remember thinking it was
the spitting image of Treebeard

23:58.393 --> 24:00.177
from the Forest of Fangorn.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.440
Look, whatever.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.093
The point is, man,
the weed worked.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.443
This is it.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.578
- Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.450
Your husband dug up wreckage
from a plane

24:11.493 --> 24:13.060
that hasn't even taken off yet.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.453
That is insane.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.456
- Yeah, but it doesn't mean
it's not true.

24:17.499 --> 24:18.674
And I trust him.

24:20.371 --> 24:21.851
- And what happens
if he doesn't make it?

24:21.895 --> 24:23.113
I just want to get home.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.463
- Yeah.
- We all want to get home.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.377
- I'm sorry, Eve,
but they're right.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.771
- They found our plane, Sam.
We can't ignore that.

24:28.815 --> 24:29.990
- We're not going to.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.339
Gavin's message
is the best thing

24:31.382 --> 24:32.514
that could have happened to us.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.950
Now Diana and I
can go back

24:33.994 --> 24:35.430
and figure out
what went wrong.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.519
- No. That's still
too big of a risk.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.303
- The only risk is
if we do nothing.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.957
- I thought you were
on board with this.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.742
- I've been here
for three years.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.745
Everyone I came with is dead.
I'm not staying another day.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.226
- Mom.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.881
They've got to try.

24:51.925 --> 24:54.014
- Now let's head back to the
plane, do a diagnostic check.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.624
- Tony, you drive them.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.757
We'll meet you back at the
clearing with the first group.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.019
- Okay.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.504
- Josh.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.157
I can't let you
get on that flight.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.029
- Mom, you heard Uncle Levi.
He can fix it.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.553
- And you heard your dad.
The plane is still gonna crash.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.337
- You honestly think
he's gonna make it down here?

25:13.381 --> 25:15.252
- Yes, I do.
He found my ring.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.819
He is the only reason
that people know

25:16.863 --> 25:18.647
we're still alive down here.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.562
Honey, I know the last
three years have been hard,

25:20.606 --> 25:22.651
but you have to remember
the person your dad was

25:22.695 --> 25:24.218
before his crash.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.655
- He's not that guy anymore.
- I didn't think so either.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.004
But that message,

25:28.048 --> 25:30.354
that's the guy that always
came through for us.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.835
He asked us to trust him.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.315
We have to do that.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.753
- You can trust him
all you want.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.146
I'm getting on that plane.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.190
- Josh.

25:47.937 --> 25:48.111
.

25:48.155 --> 25:49.548
- Veronica!

26:01.385 --> 26:02.735
Veronica.

26:08.523 --> 26:09.742
- No, no, no.
Put that down.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.613
- Just leave.
- Look, you're not in trouble.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.049
I just want to help.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.181
- You're lying.

26:14.224 --> 26:15.574
- Listen to me.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.619
Levi's fixing the plane.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.490
We're gonna get out of here.

26:19.534 --> 26:22.015
I just want you
to come with us.

26:22.058 --> 26:25.018
- Then what, huh?

26:25.061 --> 26:26.454
I go to jail?

26:26.497 --> 26:28.630
- Lilly told me the truth.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.328
That you were a victim,
same as her.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.721
- That's not true.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.636
My father was a good man.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.507
He set me free
from my old life.

26:36.551 --> 26:39.032
- But he's gone now.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.816
You can finally go home.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.211
- It's too late for that.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.778
- It's not.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.736
Your family is still out there.

26:47.780 --> 26:50.086
And I promise you,

26:50.130 --> 26:53.394
they haven't given up hope
of seeing you again.

26:53.437 --> 26:55.135
Neither should you.

27:06.015 --> 27:09.410
- Can I have a moment
to say goodbye?

27:09.453 --> 27:12.369
- Of course.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.067
I'll just be over here.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.177
- Lucas still
hasn't come back yet?

27:37.220 --> 27:39.701
- Doesn't matter
what the situation is,

27:39.745 --> 27:42.008
he always keeps me on my toes.

27:42.051 --> 27:44.967
- Well, I can see
how much you love him.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.795
- Can I help you
with something?

27:46.839 --> 27:49.493
- Why were you so quiet
back there by the drone?

27:49.537 --> 27:52.061
- Didn't have anything to add
to the conversation.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.935
- The whole time
we've been down here,

27:55.978 --> 27:59.808
you've had no problem telling
me how wrong I am until now.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.811
I think it's because
you know I'm right about this.

28:02.855 --> 28:05.161
- Doesn't matter
what I think.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.337
There are 30 people here
dying to get home.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.948
Who am I to say otherwise?

28:08.991 --> 28:11.515
- They're all gonna die
if they get on that plane.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.954
Josh and Lucas will die.

28:14.997 --> 28:17.739
I know we've had
our differences,

28:17.783 --> 28:21.090
but we both love our sons,

28:21.134 --> 28:23.353
and we're the only ones
who are gonna save them.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.488
- Say I consider it.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.708
How do I know your husband's
gonna make it down here?

28:29.751 --> 28:31.971
- You don't.

28:32.014 --> 28:35.452
Listen, I know how crazy
all this sounds,

28:35.496 --> 28:37.150
but Marybeth,
I need your help.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.809
- Well, you let me know,
as soon as you find out,

28:43.852 --> 28:45.288
who ordered this.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.292
Hey, we got a problem.

28:49.336 --> 28:52.078
An unauthorized drone was just
sent down into the sinkhole.

28:52.121 --> 28:54.080
You know anything about this?
- No, sir.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.777
But I just heard
from our people in Oregon.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.605
- Is Aldridge's plane
in custody?

28:57.648 --> 28:59.607
- There was no plane.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.367
- Okay, that was Markman again.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.934
He must know Oregon
was a dead-end.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.370
- Then I suppose
we better hurry.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.981
- Okay, I can have us
in the air in 15 minutes.

29:38.515 --> 29:41.040
- How's it going over there?
- Levi's still working on it.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.694
- First group ready to go?
- Yeah. Almost.

29:43.738 --> 29:46.349
- Hey, Billy's looking for you.
Why don't you go check on him?

29:46.393 --> 29:48.221
I'll see if I can hurry
things up with everyone else.

29:48.264 --> 29:51.137
- Thanks.
That's great. Thanks.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.235
- Where are you two going?

30:02.278 --> 30:04.237
- We're gonna go see Levi,
make sure everything's okay.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.326
- Hey, we'll be back soon.
- Yeah.

30:06.369 --> 30:09.155
- You're trying to stop, Levi,
aren't you?

30:09.198 --> 30:11.984
- Listen to me.
I'm doing this for you.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.507
Okay, Josh?
I'm doing this for everyone.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.943
- Mom, don't.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.727
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Josh.

30:20.383 --> 30:23.343
- Engine will be at max
in less than five minutes.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.605
- Dad.
- Hey.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.215
- They know you're coming.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.565
- They shoot me down,
the whole world will see it.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.393
- What if they don't care?

30:30.437 --> 30:32.656
- I'll make it.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.007
Let's go.

30:35.050 --> 30:38.053
- Damn it.
They're here.

30:38.097 --> 30:41.056
You need to leave. Now.
- But the plane's not ready.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.801
- Dad, what are we gonna do?

30:51.240 --> 31:05.907
.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.822
- Where are they?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.389
- Who are you looking for?

31:09.432 --> 31:10.433
- We know
there are four of you.

31:10.477 --> 31:11.565
Where are the others?

31:11.608 --> 31:12.783
- That is a really
good question.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.394
Do you remember,
Dr. Nathan?

31:14.437 --> 31:16.526
- No, I don't.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.623
- Oh, there they are.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.376
Listen.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.945
I get that
this is important to you,

31:43.989 --> 31:46.034
but I'm literally about
to have a heart attack.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.123
And it's not that
I don't want to help you.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.864
It's just that I actually
haven't exercised

31:49.908 --> 31:51.039
in, like,
three or four years,

31:51.083 --> 31:52.693
so this is a real shock
to my system.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.434
- Don't you get tired
of being such a little bitch?

31:54.477 --> 31:55.609
- No, Lucas.

31:55.652 --> 31:56.827
But I do get tired
of digging holes,

31:56.871 --> 31:58.394
and this is the third one.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.135
And based on what Diana said,

32:00.179 --> 32:03.573
we've got less than four hours
to get out of here.

32:03.617 --> 32:06.837
- Give me the damn shovel.
- Sure.

32:21.765 --> 32:22.984
- There's something here.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.639
- That's definitely
not what I buried.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.641
- Here. Help me.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.251
Oh, damn. It's heavy.
Come on.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.869
All right.
Stand back, yeah?

32:51.317 --> 32:53.319
- Whoa.

32:53.362 --> 32:54.973
- Damn.

32:55.016 --> 32:58.106
- 1863?

32:58.150 --> 33:00.500
That is not possible.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.850
No, no. This gold is
from the American Civil War.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.852
This shouldn't be here.
- Well, here it is, man.

33:04.895 --> 33:07.594
It's got to be worth--

33:07.637 --> 33:09.117
It's got to be worth
millions, right?

33:11.815 --> 33:14.818
Dude, I'm rich!

33:14.862 --> 33:16.472
Come on.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.865
Come on.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.826
- I went over the engine
three times.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.828
If there's something wrong,
I'm not seeing it.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.396
- I think I found something.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.007
Maybe it's not an engine issue.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.052
Was the bypass valve
open or closed?

33:31.096 --> 33:32.836
- Open. Why?

33:32.880 --> 33:34.490
- This says it's closed.

33:34.534 --> 33:35.883
The sensor must have
been damaged

33:35.926 --> 33:37.058
when the plane
hit the ground.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.625
The computer
would have automatically

33:38.668 --> 33:40.018
diverted power
to take off.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.977
- Destabilizing the engine
and causing it to crash.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.370
You're a genius,
you know that?

33:50.332 --> 33:52.073
- Eve, where's Tony?

33:52.117 --> 33:54.162
He was supposed
to bring people back.

33:54.206 --> 33:56.512
- Tony's not coming.
- Why not?

33:56.556 --> 33:58.253
- Levi, I can't
let you do this.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.907
- Eve, we figured out
what went wrong.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.213
You have to believe me.
It'll fly.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.736
- Why are we even
talking about this?

34:02.779 --> 34:05.434
We're ready to go.
- Change of plans.

34:05.478 --> 34:06.870
- Eve, what the hell is this?

34:06.914 --> 34:09.264
- Levi, everyone
on that flight will die,

34:09.308 --> 34:10.918
including you.

34:10.961 --> 34:14.008
We have to wait for Gavin.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.880
- I'm sorry.
We're leaving.

34:16.924 --> 34:20.362
Head back to the clearing
and pick everyone up there.

34:20.406 --> 34:23.104
- Stop!

34:23.148 --> 34:25.976
- Marybeth, what are you doing?
- What I have to.

34:35.682 --> 34:38.032
- Ten miles out.
- Okay.

34:39.816 --> 34:43.559
<i>- Gavin, do you copy?</i>

34:43.603 --> 34:44.952
- Yes, I copy.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.172
- I have two F-15s
heading your way.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.912
If you do not land
that plane immediately,

34:48.956 --> 34:50.610
they will shoot you down.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.002
- Oh, God.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.703
- My son is on
that first flight.

34:56.746 --> 34:58.922
So let's all just
get in the jeep.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.750
We'll talk about it
at the clearing.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.187
Hopefully, Eve's husband
gets here soon,

35:02.230 --> 35:04.798
and we're all home
by dinner.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.851
- Gavin's not coming.
He sent that drone hours ago.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.679
He'd have been here by now.
- You don't know that.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.159
- I get that you want
to believe in him.

35:18.203 --> 35:21.162
This isn't gonna
change anything.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.990
- All right, enough.
Come on, guys. Let's go.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.426
- We're not going anywhere.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.649
- Diana, put the gun down.
- No!

35:29.692 --> 35:33.043
- Diana, please.
- No!

35:33.087 --> 35:35.611
This is my last chance
to get home.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.657
- Put the gun down.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.049
Don't do this.

35:46.927 --> 35:50.060
- No, no. Diana.

35:50.104 --> 35:51.323
- No, no, no.
You're gonna be okay.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.020
Diana.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.543
- We have to get her to Sam.

35:54.587 --> 35:56.284
- Diana, you're gonna be fine.

36:00.810 --> 36:05.598
.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.208
- Sam! Sam!

36:07.252 --> 36:08.905
- What's going on over there?

36:08.949 --> 36:11.256
- What happened?

36:11.299 --> 36:13.083
- She took a shot,
I returned fire.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.563
- Riley,
get the first aid kit.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.435
Lay her flat.
- Okay. Okay.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.699
I'm gonna lay you down.
- Stay calm and breathe, okay?

36:19.742 --> 36:20.656
Come on, Diana.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.747
Keep applying pressure.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.706
Diana.

36:26.749 --> 36:29.187
We're losing her.
Beginning CPR.

36:32.886 --> 36:33.887
Come on, Diana.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.725
She's gone.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.480
<i>- Gavin, listen to me.</i>

37:01.523 --> 37:03.612
<i>Return to base now.</i>

37:07.964 --> 37:09.444
- I'm sorry, Agent Markman,

37:09.488 --> 37:11.794
but you are gonna have
to shoot us down.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.495
We're doing this.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.327
- That doesn't look good.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.464
- Jesus.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.510
- Who did this to her?

37:35.601 --> 37:38.865
- What the hell did you do?

37:38.908 --> 37:40.432
- We're still
getting home, right?

37:40.475 --> 37:42.869
- Fuel tank's damaged.
Plane's not going anywhere.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.174
- What?

37:44.218 --> 37:45.480
- We didn't want this
to happen.

37:45.524 --> 37:46.655
- None of this
would have happened

37:46.699 --> 37:48.309
if you two hadn't tried
to stop Levi.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.050
- Everyone on that plane
would have died.

37:50.093 --> 37:52.313
- You don't know that.

37:52.357 --> 37:55.273
- So we're trapped here?
- No.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.666
We still have time.
Gavin can still make it.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.239
- Here we go.

38:12.115 --> 38:15.423
Okay.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.164
It's the F-15s.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.824
<i>- My F-15s are in position
to take you down. </i>

38:27.305 --> 38:29.524
Don't make me do this.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.352
- We're not gonna
make it, Gavin.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.659
- Yes, we are.
I can outmaneuver them.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.400
- No, I'm sorry.

38:35.443 --> 38:38.185
I thought it would work
this time.

38:38.228 --> 38:39.708
- What do you mean
"this time"?

38:39.752 --> 38:41.928
- You asked me before
what I was hiding.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.973
I don't have time
to tell you everything,

38:44.017 --> 38:45.584
but I can tell you this:

38:45.627 --> 38:49.065
what's been happening to you
is for a reason.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.458
- What reason?

38:50.502 --> 38:53.113
What reason?
Hey, where are you going?

38:53.156 --> 38:54.375
<i>- Gavin, do you hear me?</i>

38:54.419 --> 38:57.378
<i>We will fire.</i>

38:57.422 --> 38:59.032
- Rebecca,
please get back here.

38:59.075 --> 39:02.949
- My destiny is down there,
but yours is here.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.690
For now.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.826
- What about my family?

39:10.870 --> 39:12.872
- There's another way
to save them.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.353
Go back to the beginning,
Gavin.

39:17.137 --> 39:21.359
November 16, 1988.

39:21.402 --> 39:24.405
Remember that date.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.321
- Aldridge! Aldridge!

39:27.365 --> 39:29.889
<i>- Gavin, what was that?</i>

39:29.932 --> 39:32.457
- She jumped.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.589
<i>Aldridge jumped.</i>

39:34.633 --> 39:38.376
- Bring the plane down now.

39:38.419 --> 39:39.986
- Ah, to hell with this.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.817
I'm going down.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.733
<i>- Dad? Dad?</i>

39:47.776 --> 39:49.474
- Izzy?

39:49.517 --> 39:50.823
- Dad, don't.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.958
<i>Dad, please.</i>

39:56.002 --> 39:59.266
They're gonna
shoot you down, Dad.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.573
- Sir, we've got a clean lock.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.531
Awaiting your order.

40:03.575 --> 40:05.794
- Izzy, I can do this.

40:05.838 --> 40:07.448
- Dad, please.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.756
I can't lose you too.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.584
<i>Please.</i>

40:21.854 --> 40:24.030
<i>- This is your last chance,
Gavin. </i>

40:27.207 --> 40:28.643
<i>- Wait.</i>

40:31.341 --> 40:34.344
Markman, hold your fire.

40:34.388 --> 40:36.477
I'm coming down.

40:54.974 --> 40:58.020
- It didn't have
to go this way.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.935
- Where's my daughter?

40:59.979 --> 41:01.850
- With your sister.

41:01.894 --> 41:04.244
- And what about the debris
at the dig site?

41:04.287 --> 41:05.593
- It disappeared.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.684
Looks like your wife
got your message.

41:13.209 --> 41:14.384
Get him out of here.

42:13.835 --> 42:17.360
- I told you
Dad wasn't gonna come.

42:17.404 --> 42:20.276
Now we're stuck down here.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.061
Because of you.

42:35.161 --> 42:35.553
.
