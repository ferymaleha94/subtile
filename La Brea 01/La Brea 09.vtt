WEBVTT

00:06.397 --> 00:08.051
You had PTSD.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.357
- So I started taking
something for it.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.315
<i>This morning I lost </i>
my last pill.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.316
Damn it!

00:12.360 --> 00:13.361
Sure about this, Sam?

00:13.404 --> 00:14.623
- She's a threat
to everyone here,

00:14.666 --> 00:16.842
- especially Lilly.
- Let me out of here!

00:16.886 --> 00:18.496
Go save them.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.629
- That's not gonna happen.
- This is private property

00:20.672 --> 00:22.631
so I hope you have a warrant.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.154
What about my family?

00:24.198 --> 00:26.156
- There's another way
to save them.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.853
Go back to
the beginning, Gavin.

00:27.897 --> 00:30.639
Looks like a sinkhole.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.249
<i>I'm in that place.</i>

00:32.293 --> 00:34.686
I don't think the things
I've been seeing are visions.

00:34.730 --> 00:35.731
<i>They're memories.</i>

00:35.774 --> 00:38.255
- It's your last warning,
Rebecca.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.430
Let him go.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.519
- Oh, my God.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.869
- The boy,
you need to find him.

00:43.913 --> 00:46.655
<i>Isiah is Gavin</i>

00:46.698 --> 00:48.657
and he needs your help.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.400
- What do you mean
Isiah needs my help?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.316
Everything depends on it.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.623
You have to find him.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.582
You have to get him to Topanga.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.631
Hold on.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.677
I'll be right back.

01:09.808 --> 01:12.507
She needs you. Hurry, hurry.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.335
We need to get Sam here
right now. She needs a doctor.

01:14.378 --> 01:17.120
- I'll go but what happened?
What did Aldridge say?

01:19.166 --> 01:21.733
We need to find Isiah.

01:21.777 --> 01:22.908
Dad, I don't understand.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.302
How could you be
from that world?

01:25.346 --> 01:28.349
- I must have come through
the sinkhole when I was a kid.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.222
I--I wasn't alone.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.355
You think Ella was with you.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.879
We were found together,

01:36.922 --> 01:39.229
less than a mile from here.

01:39.273 --> 01:42.276
- You've got two seconds
to get the hell off my property

01:42.319 --> 01:44.278
or I'm calling the police.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.931
- Ella.
- Who are you?

01:45.975 --> 01:47.890
Why have you been following me?

01:47.933 --> 01:50.284
My name is Gavin Harris.

01:50.327 --> 01:51.937
This is my daughter, Izzy.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.636
This is Dr. Sophia Nathan.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.246
We can explain everything.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.769
Please, we need your help.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.293
With what?

01:59.336 --> 02:01.425
- I know this
is gonna sound crazy,

02:01.469 --> 02:03.775
but somehow,

02:03.819 --> 02:07.562
I think you're the key
to saving my family.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.196
No...way.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.654
Hope you're all hungry.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.308
Again with the mushrooms?

02:58.352 --> 03:00.702
- Hey, until they get back from
the fort with other options,

03:00.745 --> 03:02.530
this is all we got so

03:02.573 --> 03:04.836
- eat up, Mr. Juice Cleanse.
- Yeah, very funny.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.622
- Hey, guys,
you're never gonna believe this

03:07.665 --> 03:10.842
but I just saw a cow
in the woods.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.540
Okay.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.672
- Cattle, along with
Christianity and smallpox,

03:14.716 --> 03:15.934
came here with the Europeans,

03:15.978 --> 03:17.806
specifically the Spanish

03:17.849 --> 03:20.504
in the 16th century.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.463
Okay, what I'm trying to say is
that

03:22.506 --> 03:25.335
there were no cows
in North America in 10,000 B.C.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.641
- Scott.
- Yeah.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.512
- Buddy, were you--

03:28.556 --> 03:29.774
- Don't make this
about the weed.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.254
The cow was there.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.256
- I believe you.
- Thank you, Lilly.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.258
Say there was a cow.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.781
Who cares?

03:36.825 --> 03:39.654
- Uh, cows make milk.
It could help us.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.656
- If it wasn't already
eaten by a saber tooth.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.397
- You know, you don't really
take good news very well.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.833
Has anyone ever told you that?

03:46.356 --> 03:49.011
Levi.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.361
What's going on? Where's Mom?

03:51.405 --> 03:52.971
- She's back at the village
with Ty.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.756
They're fine but
someone else is injured.

03:54.799 --> 03:55.931
Who?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.281
It's a lot to explain.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.804
Where's your dad?
I need his help.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.895
- Are you sure
you're up for this?

04:03.939 --> 04:05.070
Riley, I'm fine.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.507
- Dad, you just
got off your meds.

04:06.550 --> 04:07.899
You're gonna start
going through withdrawal.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.466
Someone's hurt. They need me.

04:09.510 --> 04:10.772
All right.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.295
Then you won't mind
if I come along.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.514
Riley.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.820
- Consider it
on the job training.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.910
After everything
that's happened down here,

04:18.954 --> 04:23.393
let's just say I'm...
reconsidering med school.

04:23.437 --> 04:25.047
Really?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.788
Yeah.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.964
Also, I'm not taking
no for an answer.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.625
We should get going.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.366
We're ready.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.935
I know something's going on.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.503
What aren't you telling me?

04:46.547 --> 04:48.940
- You should come back
to the village.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.813
You need to talk to your mom.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.513
- Any sign of Silas and Isiah?
- No, nothing.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.341
- Your people are
still out there looking.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.995
Maybe they'll have better luck.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.737
- How's Aldridge?
- She's unconscious.

05:02.780 --> 05:03.868
I've done everything I can

05:03.912 --> 05:05.392
but if your doctor
doesn't arrive soon,

05:05.435 --> 05:07.785
I don't know if she'll survive.

05:07.829 --> 05:11.136
Eve, are you okay?

05:11.180 --> 05:13.443
Well,

05:13.487 --> 05:15.097
that woman just told me
that Isiah grows up

05:15.140 --> 05:17.447
to be my husband
so no, not really.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.406
And you believe her?

05:19.449 --> 05:22.452
- Honestly, I don't--
I don't know what to believe.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.889
- Silas stabs Aldridge
and then takes off with Isiah.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.805
Why would he do that if there
wasn't something else going on?

05:27.849 --> 05:30.808
- What more can you tell us
about Isiah and Silas?

05:30.852 --> 05:32.680
Where did they come from?

05:32.723 --> 05:35.117
- They joined our village
a few years ago.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.641
Silas said they fell
through another sinkhole.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.948
That the boy's parents
didn't survive the fall.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.123
We had no reason
not to believe him

05:41.166 --> 05:43.560
so we took them in.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.607
But it seems there's
more to him than we knew.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.529
Unbelievable.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.487
Sam, thank God you're here.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.750
- I'm the doctor. Where is she?
- This way.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.405
- Josh, what are
you doing here?

06:02.449 --> 06:04.799
- Uncle Levi thought
I should come.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.844
- He needs to hear
what Aldridge told you.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.977
If there's even
a chance she's right,

06:09.020 --> 06:11.501
he should know.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.416
Mom, this is insane.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.462
How the hell could
that kid be Dad?

06:15.505 --> 06:16.550
- I'm just telling you
what she told me.

06:16.593 --> 06:20.075
- Well obviously,
she's wrong.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.644
Hold up. You don't actually
believe her, do you?

06:23.687 --> 06:25.907
- I don't know. It's just--
- It's just what?

06:25.950 --> 06:28.866
There's something about him.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.782
His eyes and--and his smile.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.523
- Mom.
- Your dad doesn't have

06:33.567 --> 06:35.438
any memories from childhood.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.962
And he was the same age Isiah
is now when he was adopted.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.574
And I'm not saying
I believe it.

06:40.617 --> 06:43.490
I'm just trying--
I'm trying to understand it.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.492
- Hey.
She had blood in her lungs,

06:45.535 --> 06:47.015
but Sam was able to drain it.

06:47.058 --> 06:50.105
She's going to be okay.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.933
Come on, she's awake.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.506
- Have you found Isiah?
- Not yet.

06:59.549 --> 07:02.465
Our people are still searching.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.206
Okay.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.947
All right, so...

07:05.990 --> 07:09.559
when you said Isiah is Gavin--

07:09.603 --> 07:11.866
- I understand
why you wouldn't believe me

07:11.909 --> 07:13.128
but it's true.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.956
How is it possible?

07:14.999 --> 07:17.741
Gavin was born in this world.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.178
He came to ours
through a sinkhole

07:20.222 --> 07:22.267
in Topanga in 1988.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.705
- That's where your dad
was adopted.

07:24.748 --> 07:28.578
- There's a portal on top
of a mountain in Topanga.

07:28.622 --> 07:33.104
It's open right now
and it leads to 1988.

07:33.148 --> 07:36.847
You have to get Isiah
through it.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.589
I was gonna do it myself
until Silas stopped me.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.766
How do you know all of this?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.638
It doesn't matter.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.553
The only thing that does

07:46.596 --> 07:50.034
is finding him and
getting him through the light.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.254
It's on the highest peak
in the area.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.908
No way.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.126
I don't trust her.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.651
- Neither did Gavin
and Izzy at first.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.783
- Wait, you were with them?
- Yes.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.655
Before I came down here,

08:01.698 --> 08:04.788
we were trying to rescue you.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.573
Are they okay?

08:06.616 --> 08:08.966
For now.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.316
- What does that mean,
"for now?"

08:11.360 --> 08:14.624
- If Isiah doesn't
make it to 1988,

08:14.668 --> 08:17.845
you and Gavin will never meet.

08:17.888 --> 08:21.022
Josh and Izzy
will never be born.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.633
You don't have much time.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.635
The light is gonna close.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.769
- When?
- Tomorrow.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.816
- So we're just supposed
to send Isiah alone?

08:32.860 --> 08:33.991
He'll be fine.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.124
You already know
how it turns out.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.561
Mom, come on, this is crazy.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.911
- Josh, you may not
believe me now,

08:40.955 --> 08:44.001
but when the light
starts to close, you will.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.743
You're gonna begin to get sick.

08:46.787 --> 08:49.180
Izzy will too.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.182
The more it closes,
the worse it'll be.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.749
What are you saying?

08:52.793 --> 08:55.752
- If you don't get Isiah
through the light in time,

08:55.796 --> 08:59.060
your children will die.

09:03.238 --> 09:03.455
.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.588
- So this is your
parents' house?

09:05.632 --> 09:08.504
Yes, my adoptive parents.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.984
I grew up here.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.508
- And you never noticed
a sinkhole in your backyard?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.944
Of course we did.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.686
It was filled in not that long
after I was adopted.

09:16.730 --> 09:20.168
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to your family,

09:20.211 --> 09:21.256
but what you're saying,

09:21.299 --> 09:22.692
that we came through
that sinkhole,

09:22.736 --> 09:25.086
that we're from the past,
it can't be true.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.174
- I understand
what you're feeling,

09:26.217 --> 09:28.568
but I'm telling you it is.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.787
Have you seen
this woman before?

09:30.831 --> 09:33.529
- No.
- Her name is Rebecca Aldridge.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.531
She's the one
who led us to you.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.403
- She said there's another way
to get to my family

09:38.447 --> 09:41.102
and I think somehow,
you might know what it is.

09:41.145 --> 09:44.627
- I'm sorry.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.543
I wish I could help,
but I don't know anything.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.634
- Ella, hey, I was found
on the road not far from here.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.201
I was with a little girl.

09:53.244 --> 09:57.118
Records at CPS said it was you.

10:00.904 --> 10:05.343
Do you remember anything
before you were adopted?

10:05.387 --> 10:06.431
No.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.563
My parents told me

10:07.607 --> 10:09.434
a reverend
discovered me nearby.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.263
When CPS couldn't place me,
they took me in,

10:12.307 --> 10:14.570
but they never said
anything about you.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.790
Well, I was there.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.488
And that's not the only thing
we have in common.

10:19.531 --> 10:23.231
Your drawings, the hand prints,

10:23.274 --> 10:25.189
I've seen that before.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.104
What do you mean?

10:28.584 --> 10:31.413
I have these flashes

10:31.456 --> 10:34.111
of that place in the past.

10:38.420 --> 10:42.467
You have them too, don't you?

10:42.511 --> 10:45.296
For the last week.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.910
- Did they start the day
the La Brea sinkhole opened?

10:49.953 --> 10:51.389
How do you know that?

10:51.433 --> 10:53.783
- Because the same thing
happened to me.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.524
Only mine started when I was

10:55.567 --> 10:58.266
flying over a sinkhole
in the Mojave.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.442
I think somehow the sinkholes
trigger our memories--

11:00.485 --> 11:01.704
Stop.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.358
Please.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.708
I appreciate you trying
to explain this to me,

11:05.752 --> 11:07.449
but I have a life.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.278
I have an art show in a week.
I don't have time for this.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.280
I just want
to put this behind me.

11:12.323 --> 11:15.152
- Ella--
- Please, you need to go.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.637
Thank you for your time.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.907
- Josh, hold on.
- Just give me a second.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.170
- It's gonna be fine.
Just don't freak out.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.302
That's easy for you to say.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.651
You're not the one
that's gonna,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.348
I don't know, cease to exist.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.960
- We're not gonna
let that happen.

11:40.003 --> 11:43.267
- Say there's a 1% chance
that all this is true.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.486
The only way to stop it
from happening

11:44.529 --> 11:46.662
is to find the kid
and the kid is gone.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.316
So we'll find him.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.491
Whatever it takes, Josh,

11:49.534 --> 11:53.451
I'm gonna keep you
and your sister safe.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.453
Come on. We should get going.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.978
Silas knows these woods.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.675
He could be anywhere.
We need to split up.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.937
So you're gonna help us?

12:00.981 --> 12:04.201
- I trusted Silas
and he lied to me.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.508
If your children's lives
and Isiah's future generations

12:06.551 --> 12:09.598
depend on stopping him,
I'm going to help.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.513
- We've got the Jeep. We can
cover more ground that way.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.210
- All right.
Josh and I will go with you.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.299
- Paara and I will
search on foot.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.561
- We should keep
an eye on Aldridge.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.954
She's not out of the woods yet.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.740
Okay. Hey.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.876
You're not gonna die, okay?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.835
Not when you're finally
starting to grow on me.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.577
Let's go.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.547
I wanna go home.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.288
We need to stay here for now.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.551
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

12:49.594 --> 12:53.685
Why did you hurt that woman?

12:53.729 --> 12:55.644
I had no choice.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.776
I'm trying to protect you.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.735
You understand that, don't you?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.824
You're the only family I have.

13:01.868 --> 13:05.785
I won't let anyone
take you away from me.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.396
She said my name is Gavin.

13:08.439 --> 13:09.832
That woman is sick.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.878
- She thinks you're someone else.
- Who?

13:11.921 --> 13:14.924
It doesn't matter!

13:24.891 --> 13:28.546
You must be hungry.
Saw some blueberries outside.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.549
They're still your favorite,
aren't they?

13:31.593 --> 13:33.595
Be back soon.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.867
- Tic-tac-toe.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.435
- Would you believe me if I
told you I was letting you win?

13:47.478 --> 13:51.308
- No.
- Hmm.

13:56.879 --> 14:00.404
You wanna talk to her?

14:00.448 --> 14:01.666
Go ahead.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.321
I'll be watching.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.114
- You have permission
to talk to me?

14:14.157 --> 14:17.857
- I just wanted to see
if you're okay.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.685
No, I'm not.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.950
We can't stay here.

14:23.993 --> 14:27.823
I told you, I'm not leaving.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.869
Everyone knows what I did.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
Don't you see
how they look at me?

14:37.006 --> 14:39.966
- I know you're a good person,
Veronica.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.098
Give them some time.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.927
They'll see it too.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.712
No, they won't.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.541
Then change their minds.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.502
We don't have
to be alone anymore.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.025
Aaron's gone.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.549
We can start over.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.813
- Can I get
everyone's attention?

15:01.857 --> 15:04.120
I know you all think of me
as the stoner,

15:04.164 --> 15:06.035
which is an antiquated term,

15:06.079 --> 15:08.951
and none of you believe
the things that I say.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.997
Well today,
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.564
There is a cow out there.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.175
And together, we can find it.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.003
We can bring it back.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.526
We can reap the rewards

15:18.569 --> 15:21.007
Mother Nature has bestowed
upon this regal animal.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.792
It will give us milk,
and cheese,

15:23.835 --> 15:25.098
and ice cream!

15:25.141 --> 15:26.926
So who's coming with me?

15:29.972 --> 15:31.887
Wait--okay, show of hands.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.891
Anybody?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.806
- Happy hunting, Scott.
- Oh.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.071
Guess I'll go by myself.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.083
Let me move those branches.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.133
- Hey, how you doing
back there?

16:00.176 --> 16:03.179
- I was just thinking
about a week ago.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.833
When getting into college

16:04.876 --> 16:08.750
seemed like the most stressful
thing that could ever happen.

16:08.793 --> 16:11.579
Now my life depends on some kid

16:11.622 --> 16:15.017
who might be Dad.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.541
Eve, Josh.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.937
What's up?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.592
Look, smoke.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.551
Yeah, let's check it out.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.906
There's no one here.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.778
Yeah, not now.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.780
Fire looks like
it was just put out.

16:38.823 --> 16:39.911
- We don't even know
if it was them.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.826
Yes, we do.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.177
I saw Silas
carrying this earlier.

16:44.220 --> 16:47.658
Maybe they're still close by.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.533
Look.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.622
These tracks.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.711
Looks like they went that way.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.930
It's too rocky to drive.
We should follow on foot.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.280
Josh, grab the Jeep.
Meet us on the other side.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.716
You got it.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.893
Mom, go. I'll be fine.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.615
Oh, no.

18:06.172 --> 18:06.346
.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.087
It's okay.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.262
It's me, Josh.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.481
Remember me?
We met at the clearing.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.135
What are you doing here?

18:13.179 --> 18:15.137
- Looking for you.
You need to come with me.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.270
I wanna go home.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.709
Why are you looking at me
like that?

18:21.752 --> 18:25.669
- Sorry, I'm just...
making sure you're okay.

18:25.713 --> 18:26.801
I am.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.630
Isiah, you okay?

18:29.673 --> 18:31.240
- Uh, we're fine.
- What the hell happened?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.068
We heard the crash
from across the hill.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.244
He saved me.

18:36.550 --> 18:37.725
Oh, your wrist.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.641
Levi, get me the first aid kit.

18:46.690 --> 18:50.216
Mom, that cut.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.565
It's in the exact same spot.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.393
I know.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.443
We should leave.

19:00.487 --> 19:01.618
There could be more
saber tooths

19:01.662 --> 19:03.229
and Silas is gonna
come looking for him.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.579
- That Jeep's not gonna drive.
We'll have to walk.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.450
Isiah, we have to go.

19:07.494 --> 19:10.236
- What? No, I wanna
go back to my village.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.195
- I can't take you there
right now, okay?

19:13.239 --> 19:15.241
But I'm gonna take you
somewhere safe.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.546
We gotta get moving.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.245
Will you come with me?

19:34.695 --> 19:36.827
Here, little cow.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.873
I know you're out here
somewhere.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.397
Scott?

19:41.441 --> 19:44.574
Uh, what are you doing here?

19:44.618 --> 19:47.751
Um, you said you needed help.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.145
And you want to do that?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.365
You helped me once.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.628
Thought I could
return the favor.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.586
Actually, I'm okay on my own.

19:56.630 --> 19:57.587
- But you just made
that big speech.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.849
Right, right.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.417
But I was kinda, you know,

20:01.461 --> 20:03.419
being dramatic.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.769
It's fine, really.
Thanks though.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.946
- You need to look
for low grass.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.601
That's what they like to eat.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.733
How do you know that?

20:12.776 --> 20:17.303
I grew up on a farm in Texas.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.218
You're not going to find
that cow without me.

20:22.656 --> 20:26.529
Why are you really out here?

20:26.573 --> 20:30.316
- They all think
you're just a pothead,

20:30.359 --> 20:34.494
but...sometimes people
are judged too quickly

20:34.537 --> 20:37.279
and I don't think that's fair.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.454
Thanks.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.239
I guess.

20:40.282 --> 20:43.242
So let's prove 'em wrong.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.857
These are Silas's tracks

20:49.900 --> 20:52.468
and he's not alone.

20:52.512 --> 20:53.774
At least four people.

20:53.817 --> 20:54.992
Four?

20:55.036 --> 20:57.821
They were headed north.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.650
Ty, your nose.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.000
Oh.

21:03.044 --> 21:06.003
- Sit down.
- I'm sorry.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.962
Tilt your head back.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.445
This happens on occasion.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.497
The truth is...

21:21.541 --> 21:23.325
I'm ill.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.376
You're dying?

21:30.419 --> 21:33.335
Yeah.

21:33.379 --> 21:36.425
The universe doesn't like me
to forget I'm on borrowed time.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.647
I'm so sorry.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.431
It's okay.

21:47.393 --> 21:50.744
- Looks like the bleeding
stopped.

21:50.787 --> 21:54.313
- You know, I'm usually
the one looking after people.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.316
Thank you.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.550
I wasn't expecting that.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.596
Neither was I.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.729
We should keep going.

22:24.604 --> 22:26.606
- Topanga is about 10 miles
northwest of here.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.738
We should make it
by the end of the day.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.566
Where are you taking me?

22:30.610 --> 22:32.786
- Somewhere safe,
like my mom said.

22:32.829 --> 22:35.397
- My grandfather
will be worried about me.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.920
I don't think I should've left.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.880
- Why did you?
- I didn't like what he did.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.098
He hurt someone.

22:41.142 --> 22:44.754
- I know,
but she's going to be okay.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.409
- He said he was trying
to protect me.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.759
My mom says that a lot.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.587
What about your dad?

22:51.631 --> 22:55.417
Does he protect you too?

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
He tried to

22:57.463 --> 23:01.771
but...he wasn't always
there for me...

23:01.815 --> 23:03.599
or my mom.

23:03.643 --> 23:06.428
They seem okay now.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.735
Oh, no, Levi isn't my dad.

23:08.778 --> 23:12.956
Oh, sorry.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.655
Why would you say that?

23:15.698 --> 23:17.439
- Because I saw them
holding hands

23:17.483 --> 23:19.615
when I was at your clearing.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.490
- I still can't believe
he's actually Gavin.

23:24.533 --> 23:27.057
- Trying to wrap
my mind around it.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.842
What are you gonna tell him?

23:28.885 --> 23:31.018
I haven't figured it out yet.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.760
I mean, what we're asking
him to do, to--

23:33.803 --> 23:35.631
to leave his home
and to travel through a portal

23:35.675 --> 23:37.807
to a place he doesn't know,
It's a lot to ask.

23:37.851 --> 23:40.549
What other choice do we have?

23:42.812 --> 23:45.598
Hey, Isiah,
I need to talk to you.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.469
Should we come sit?

23:47.513 --> 23:49.515
Okay.

23:56.043 --> 23:58.480
- You know how you call us
The Sky People?

23:58.524 --> 24:00.482
Truth is,

24:00.526 --> 24:04.530
you're one of us and...

24:04.573 --> 24:06.836
and you're not supposed
to stay here.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.709
You're supposed to grow up
where I come from.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.493
What do you mean?

24:12.712 --> 24:13.669
Well, there's a light
in the sky

24:13.713 --> 24:15.192
that's not too far from here

24:15.236 --> 24:18.935
and it leads to
a different time

24:18.979 --> 24:21.024
and we need you
to go through it.

24:21.068 --> 24:23.200
- I have to leave my home?
- I know it's scary

24:23.244 --> 24:25.420
and it's--it's really
hard to understand,

24:25.464 --> 24:26.813
but I know every single thing

24:26.856 --> 24:28.510
that's gonna
happen to you there.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.078
And it's--it's gonna be great.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.559
- I don't want to.
- I know.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.996
But you have to. - No!

24:36.039 --> 24:39.173
This way. Come on.

24:39.216 --> 24:41.828
- Someone's coming.
- Come on. Come on.

24:41.871 --> 24:44.874
Pick it up.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.920
- I thought Paara's people
were supposed to be helping us.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.749
- I guess Silas still has
a few loyal friends.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.752
We gotta get moving.

24:59.062 --> 24:59.236
.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.065
- So what now? Ella didn't
believe anything we said.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.371
Can you blame her?

25:03.414 --> 25:04.633
I'm still trying
to process the fact

25:04.677 --> 25:06.983
that you're from 10,000 B.C.

25:07.027 --> 25:10.421
- Crazy as it is,
it's kind of a relief.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.511
What do you mean?

25:12.554 --> 25:14.382
- I never knew
where I came from,

25:14.425 --> 25:16.558
why I see these things.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.647
Now I do.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.388
We just have to find
a way to convince Ella

25:20.431 --> 25:24.044
what we're saying is true.

25:24.087 --> 25:27.221
- I mean, I didn't believe you
until you dug up mom's ring

25:27.264 --> 25:28.962
so maybe we need
some kind of proof.

25:29.005 --> 25:32.574
Where would we find that?

25:32.618 --> 25:35.011
Aldridge's dig site.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.447
A lot of Ella's drawings

25:36.491 --> 25:38.232
seem to be things
from the clearing.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.060
If we could find
an artifact she drew,

25:40.103 --> 25:42.192
maybe we could
convince her it's real.

25:42.236 --> 25:44.194
- So basically,
I gave you the idea.

25:46.414 --> 25:49.373
- I'm guessing Markman has
people guarding the dig site?

25:49.417 --> 25:51.245
As far as I know.

25:51.288 --> 25:54.596
- There another way
to get inside?

25:59.296 --> 26:02.430
I'm going in.
You two stay here.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.040
Be careful.

26:58.704 --> 27:02.098
- Fuse must have blown.
Let's check it out.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.243
Whatcha got there?

27:16.286 --> 27:18.027
Mm, no idea.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.638
One of the kids gave it to me.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.293
But whatever it is,
it's amazing.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.034
- How's she doing?
- Stable,

27:25.078 --> 27:26.470
which means you and I
should get going soon.

27:26.514 --> 27:27.646
- Not till you've
eaten something.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.779
It's not mushroom, is it?

27:30.823 --> 27:34.827
Definitely not.

27:34.870 --> 27:37.394
So how are you feeling?

27:37.438 --> 27:39.179
Up and down.

27:39.222 --> 27:43.444
One minute, smooth sailing.
Next, it's a wave of anxiety.

27:43.487 --> 27:45.359
But I'm getting through it.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.535
And what about you?

27:47.578 --> 27:50.669
I know you're worried
about Josh.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.367
I haven't seen you look at
a guy like that since--

27:53.410 --> 27:54.716
what's his name?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.196
Really, Dad?

27:56.239 --> 27:58.328
You know his name.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.504
Kyle. Ugh.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.245
He was no good for you.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.638
I'm aware.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.249
That's why
I kicked him to the curb.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.384
- If Aldridge
is right about all this

28:10.427 --> 28:13.256
and that's one big "if,"

28:13.300 --> 28:16.433
it means there's a light
that leads to 1988.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.783
If there's a way to '88,

28:17.826 --> 28:20.394
I figured there's also
gotta be a way back home

28:20.437 --> 28:21.787
to Mom and Andrew.

28:21.830 --> 28:25.399
I say we stay until we find it.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.445
- I was gonna say
the same thing.

28:37.150 --> 28:40.762
Where is it, Silas?

28:57.518 --> 29:00.347
Hey, what are you doing up?

29:00.390 --> 29:02.175
- I have to go back
to your clearing.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.567
- It's not a good idea.
You need to rest.

29:03.611 --> 29:04.568
- Come on,
we'll take you back up.

29:04.612 --> 29:07.789
No, I can't stay here.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.444
- What's so important
at the clearing?

29:12.272 --> 29:16.580
- You care about
your friend, Josh, don't you?

29:16.624 --> 29:18.321
Yes.

29:18.365 --> 29:21.803
- Everything I'm doing
is to make sure he lives.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.286
Please, we have to go.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.591
Now.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.465
- You know the men
who are with your grandfather?

29:31.508 --> 29:34.424
- Yes.
They'll do whatever he says.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.731
- It's all right.
We just gotta keep moving.

29:45.305 --> 29:46.654
What are we gonna do?

29:46.697 --> 29:48.656
- Doesn't look like
there's another way around.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.745
- There's a bridge
not far from here.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.834
My people cross it
to trade with other villages.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.401
Where is it?

29:54.444 --> 29:56.272
- Just beyond those trees.
- Well, hold on.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.448
If he knows about it,
then his grandfather does.

29:58.492 --> 29:59.754
- Yeah, then we better
get there first.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.929
Come on.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.324
There it is.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.810
- All right, Eve, Isiah,
you go first.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.377
I'll be right behind you.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.696
- Okay, we're good.
Come on over.

30:28.739 --> 30:29.871
All right Josh, you're up.

30:29.915 --> 30:33.527
- Don't move.
- Josh!

30:33.570 --> 30:37.879
Drop your weapon.

30:37.923 --> 30:41.448
All I want is my grandson.

30:41.491 --> 30:44.277
Send him over
and I'll let 'em go.

30:47.062 --> 30:50.544
Do it now
or I'll kill 'em both.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.720
Please don't.

30:58.682 --> 31:00.771
No!

31:05.733 --> 31:08.692
The ravine ends
four miles east of here.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.825
Bring Isiah there

31:10.869 --> 31:14.873
or you'll never see them again.

31:26.145 --> 31:26.362
.

31:26.406 --> 31:28.190
Okay, so we've got low grass

31:28.234 --> 31:29.539
but we've got no cow.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.801
Fantastic.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.412
- Do you wanna go back?

31:32.455 --> 31:34.196
I am many things

31:34.240 --> 31:37.417
but a quitter
is not one of them.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.768
Hey, about earlier,

31:40.811 --> 31:42.901
the car and all.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.946
I don't think they should've
done that to you.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.252
It wasn't cool.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.906
- You don't think
I deserved it?

31:47.949 --> 31:49.516
No. From what I heard,

31:49.559 --> 31:53.041
you were kidnapped
just like Lilly.

31:53.085 --> 31:56.044
Which you probably
don't wanna talk about.

31:56.088 --> 31:59.178
- I've never talked about it
with anyone besides Lilly.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.051
What happened?

32:05.184 --> 32:08.448
- I ran away from home
when I was 14.

32:08.491 --> 32:09.928
My mom was never around.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.190
My stepdad and I
fought all the time

32:11.233 --> 32:13.061
so I--I just left.

32:13.105 --> 32:16.369
- That's young for you to be
out on your own like that.

32:16.412 --> 32:20.373
- I guess I thought anything
was better than staying.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.549
Where did you go?

32:22.592 --> 32:24.464
Hitched around for a while.

32:24.507 --> 32:27.336
Ended up in Los Angeles.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.426
I was living on the streets
when Aaron took me.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.386
He said he was trying to help.

32:33.429 --> 32:36.215
It was just the two of us
for a few years.

32:36.258 --> 32:39.305
Until you took Lilly?

32:41.524 --> 32:46.355
- Aaron told me that God
had a plan for all of us.

32:46.399 --> 32:49.968
By that time, I--
I believed him.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.970
And now?

32:53.972 --> 32:56.148
- I don't know
what to believe anymore.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.196
Thanks for listening.

33:02.197 --> 33:05.113
- No worries.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.855
Did you hear that?

33:15.950 --> 33:18.997
Nice to see you too.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.000
It's okay, Eve.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.392
We'll go back
to my grandfather.

33:23.436 --> 33:26.047
He'll keep his word.
Josh and Levi will be fine.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.657
- It's not that simple.
- Why?

33:27.701 --> 33:31.879
- Because as soon as that light
starts to close,

33:31.922 --> 33:33.881
my kids will become very sick.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.144
And if you don't
make it through,

33:36.188 --> 33:38.059
they're gonna die.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.192
Eve.

33:40.235 --> 33:44.109
- Paara. - Isiah.

33:44.152 --> 33:47.503
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

33:47.547 --> 33:50.506
Where are Josh and Levi?

33:54.554 --> 33:55.990
Don't worry.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.557
I'll figure out a way
to get us out of here.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.560
- In case you haven't noticed,
these guys are all armed.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.650
- We'll be all right.
Your mom and Isiah will be too.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.913
I won't let anything
happen to her.

34:05.956 --> 34:09.569
No, you wouldn't, would you?

34:09.612 --> 34:12.006
What's that supposed to mean?

34:12.050 --> 34:16.271
I know about you and my mom.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.144
Josh, I'm sorry.

34:19.187 --> 34:22.451
How could you?

34:22.495 --> 34:23.974
- It was a tough time
for your mom and dad

34:24.018 --> 34:26.629
but that's over now.

34:26.673 --> 34:29.197
- Wait, what do you mean
it's over?

34:29.241 --> 34:30.372
I thought it started down here.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.941
How long has this
been going on for?

34:33.984 --> 34:35.203
A few months

34:35.247 --> 34:37.510
but we ended it last year.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.120
I can't believe this.

34:39.164 --> 34:42.123
I mean, my mom,
I get her side of things.

34:42.167 --> 34:45.213
When she needed my dad,
he wasn't there.

34:45.257 --> 34:48.173
You, he was your best friend.

34:48.216 --> 34:51.306
- Look, you have every right
to be upset.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.960
You do.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.483
But right now,
we need to put all that aside

34:54.527 --> 34:56.355
so we can get out of this.

34:56.398 --> 34:58.400
You understand?

35:03.449 --> 35:05.233
Holy crap, you were right.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.279
- Indeed.

35:07.322 --> 35:08.323
And I believe
the more appropriate

35:08.367 --> 35:10.499
expression is "holy cow."

35:10.543 --> 35:12.066
You saved her.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.678
I did, with Veronica's help.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.420
Really?

35:18.464 --> 35:21.119
Absolutely.

35:21.162 --> 35:24.644
Couldn't have done
it without her.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.264
- As soon as that light
starts to close,

35:36.308 --> 35:38.179
my kids will become very sick.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.789
And if you don't
make it through,

35:39.833 --> 35:42.140
they're gonna die.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.533
- Dad, what's wrong?
What'd you see?

35:47.145 --> 35:49.190
I'm with Mom.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.539
Everything's fine.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.280
Come on.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.199
- I already told you--
- I know

35:58.243 --> 36:00.070
but there's something
I need to show you.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.203
Just give me a few minutes.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.597
If you still don't believe me,
we'll leave.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.643
We'll never come back.

36:09.732 --> 36:11.299
Where did you get this?

36:11.343 --> 36:13.040
- From an archeological
dig site.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.650
It dates back to 10,000 B.C.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.653
Ella, you drew it

36:17.697 --> 36:20.308
because you were there.

36:25.748 --> 36:28.142
I remember now.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.363
Oh, my God.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.191
What is it?

36:34.714 --> 36:37.325
You were right.

36:37.369 --> 36:43.157
I saw this rock in that world.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.637
What are you doing?

36:44.680 --> 36:47.683
- And someone called me
by a different name.

36:47.727 --> 36:54.473
What was it?

36:54.516 --> 36:55.735
Lilly.

36:58.128 --> 36:58.303
.

36:58.346 --> 37:00.130
- If I don't
give him Isiah back,

37:00.174 --> 37:01.828
he's gonna kill Josh and Levi.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.786
- We won't let that happen.
- Is there anyone

37:03.830 --> 37:04.918
in your village
who can help us?

37:04.961 --> 37:06.311
Silas has many friends.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.051
I'm not sure
who I can trust right now.

37:10.097 --> 37:13.013
- The clearing. We can go back.
We can get help.

37:13.056 --> 37:14.406
- No, no one's
gonna wanna help me.

37:14.449 --> 37:15.842
I'm the reason we're all
stuck down here, remember?

37:15.885 --> 37:17.278
- No, you are the reason
we are still alive.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.584
I'll make sure they know that.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.150
- That sounds great, Ty,
but I can't count on it.

37:20.194 --> 37:22.849
- Eve, you cannot
do this on your own.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.851
We'll be back
as soon as we can.

37:24.894 --> 37:28.333
Just promise me
you'll wait for us.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.552
Okay.

37:35.818 --> 37:38.038
Everyone, gather around.

37:38.081 --> 37:41.215
Easy. Easy.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.956
Who's this?

37:42.999 --> 37:45.306
This is Dr. Rebecca Aldridge.

37:45.350 --> 37:49.354
She came down here
during a second rescue attempt.

37:49.397 --> 37:52.139
- Unfortunately, the mission
didn't go as planned.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.097
I was the only one
who made it through

37:54.141 --> 37:56.317
but there is hope.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.711
- Looks like there's
another portal.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.365
This one's in Topanga

38:00.408 --> 38:02.367
and it leads back
to the year 1988.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.586
- 1988?
- What?

38:04.630 --> 38:06.240
We came down in 2021

38:06.284 --> 38:09.678
so how is there
something opened in 1988?

38:09.722 --> 38:12.899
- You think of time
as moving in one direction,

38:12.942 --> 38:14.727
the past to the present.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.772
But the truth is time
is more like a circle.

38:16.816 --> 38:19.079
Everything's happening at once.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.733
You lost me.

38:20.776 --> 38:24.954
- The point is this portal
is a way out of here.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.740
Okay, say it's true.

38:27.783 --> 38:31.134
1988 is over
30 years off target.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.614
- And how would we get
through the light?

38:32.658 --> 38:34.790
- Don't we need a plane?
- No.

38:34.834 --> 38:37.097
The light's on top
of a mountain.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.794
You can walk through it.

38:38.838 --> 38:41.928
- I know this is
a lot to think about,

38:41.971 --> 38:44.278
but you have to decide quick.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.106
The light's closing tomorrow.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.282
Tomorrow?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.283
- This is insane.
- I'm in.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.941
Here, have some of this.

38:54.984 --> 38:57.378
I can talk to my grandfather.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.120
Tell him to let them go.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.382
- You're very brave,
you know that?

39:01.426 --> 39:03.993
But he won't agree to that.

39:04.037 --> 39:06.300
Ty and Paara will be here
soon with help.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.346
We just need to wait.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.004
What about you two?

39:15.048 --> 39:17.311
Thinking about
going back to 1988?

39:17.355 --> 39:20.401
- Took me almost 20 years
to tell my father I was gay.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.360
Going back to a time
when so many people had to hide

39:22.403 --> 39:24.100
who they really were,

39:24.144 --> 39:27.060
I don't think
I'm really interested in that.

39:27.103 --> 39:30.803
- But they do have electricity
and Pizza Hut

39:30.846 --> 39:33.414
and most importantly,
LensCrafters.

39:33.458 --> 39:38.288
I say we take our chances.

39:38.332 --> 39:41.161
So are you gonna go to 1988?

39:41.204 --> 39:42.423
Well, it would be cool

39:42.467 --> 39:43.990
to see "Die Hard"
in the movie theater,

39:44.033 --> 39:46.340
but I haven't given up
on getting home.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.168
Plus, this place
is full of mysteries

39:48.211 --> 39:49.474
and I don't think I can leave

39:49.517 --> 39:52.346
without at least solving
one or two of them.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.435
What about you?

39:54.479 --> 39:56.916
I've been thinking

39:56.959 --> 39:59.440
maybe what I need
is a fresh start.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.051
This could be my chance.

40:03.052 --> 40:05.054
Good luck, Veronica.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.143
Thank you.

40:17.327 --> 40:21.897
- Yeah, there's definitely
more mysteries to solve.

40:25.466 --> 40:28.382
Hello, Lilly.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.036
How do you know my name?

40:30.079 --> 40:31.864
Do you mind if I sit down?

40:42.048 --> 40:44.093
This is for you.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.835
There's something very
important I need you to do.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.759
Everything okay?

40:57.803 --> 41:01.328
- I need you to take me
to Topanga.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.286
And we have to leave now.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.552
- I was wearing this
when I was found.

41:07.595 --> 41:10.076
My parents kept everything
from that day.

41:10.119 --> 41:12.818
They thought it may
help me remember.

41:12.861 --> 41:14.384
It never made any sense to me.

41:14.428 --> 41:16.082
Until now.

41:16.125 --> 41:19.477
- What is that?
- It's a map.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.088
That woman you showed me
a picture of earlier,

41:22.131 --> 41:25.308
I had another memory
of her giving it to me.

41:25.352 --> 41:27.485
She said I had to go to Topanga

41:27.528 --> 41:29.269
and bring it to
a boy named Isiah.

41:29.312 --> 41:30.531
Oh, my God.

41:30.575 --> 41:33.142
They're sinkhole locations.
Look at this.

41:33.186 --> 41:36.450
Topanga, Mojave, La Brea,

41:36.494 --> 41:38.191
Seattle.

41:38.234 --> 41:39.322
Dad,

41:39.366 --> 41:41.107
all the dates match perfectly.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.979
- Yeah.
And according to this map,

41:44.023 --> 41:46.025
the one in Seattle
is gonna open tomorrow.

41:51.030 --> 41:52.814
Where are they, Eve?

41:52.858 --> 41:54.512
They should be here by now.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.258
Listen to me.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.608
Whatever happens to me,

42:03.651 --> 42:05.914
you get yourself
up that mountain, okay?

42:05.958 --> 42:07.916
What are you gonna do?

42:07.960 --> 42:09.483
Just stay hidden.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.484
When Ty and Paara get here,

42:10.528 --> 42:12.965
they're gonna help you, okay?

42:13.008 --> 42:15.881
- No, Eve, wait,
you shouldn't go alone.

42:15.924 --> 42:17.578
I don't have a choice.

42:17.622 --> 42:19.885
I have to save my son.
