We don't know them.
They won't understand us.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.629
- I know.

37:20.673 --> 37:26.940
You're right.
I didn't tell them anything.

37:29.682 --> 37:35.253
- It's okay.
Sweetie, I'm not mad.

37:35.296 --> 37:38.865
We'll just forget this
ever happened, okay?

37:54.881 --> 37:56.970
- Dude, I've been
looking everywhere for you.

37:57.013 --> 37:58.798
We need to talk.
- What, Scott?

37:58.841 --> 38:00.234
- I think I know
exactly where we are.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.454
- And how could you
possibly know that?

38:02.497 --> 38:05.021
- Because of the camels.

38:05.065 --> 38:07.154
- The camels?
- Yeah, like, eight of them.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.504
They were about to walk
into a pit of tar

38:09.548 --> 38:11.332
until I saved them.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.899
- Okay.

38:12.942 --> 38:16.250
- Those were the Tar Pits,
like the ones in LA.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.472
- Wait, you think
we're in Los Angeles?

38:20.515 --> 38:22.169
- Yes.
- Are you high?

38:22.212 --> 38:23.736
- Yeah,
but that's not relevant.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.694
Look, I remember those camels.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.392
Their bones were excavated
last year.

38:27.435 --> 38:28.741
It was, like, a huge find.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.134
And there were eight of them.
Just like now.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.484
- I thought you just said
you saved them.

38:32.527 --> 38:34.355
- I did. I mean, I don't know.
Maybe I changed

38:34.399 --> 38:36.096
the course of history.
Look, that's not the point.

38:36.139 --> 38:39.273
Scientists from the Tar Pits
carbon-dated those bones.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.102
They were from around
the year 10,000 B.C.

38:42.145 --> 38:45.888
So if I'm right, that would
mean that we're in LA.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.673
And it's sometime
during the last Ice Age.

38:47.716 --> 38:50.023
Isn't that insane?

38:50.066 --> 38:52.242
- I can't deal with this
right now. I have to go.

38:52.286 --> 38:55.028
- Riley.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.508
- I'm gonna go find them.
- Well, hold on.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.074
Let me go with you.
- You've done more than enough.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.641
- I'm not gonna let you
do this alone.

38:59.685 --> 39:00.686
Let me look for somebody to--

39:00.729 --> 39:02.383
- Riley!
- Dad.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.646
- Riley!

39:08.128 --> 39:09.390
- Dad.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.393
- Easy, easy, easy.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.874
Hey, kiddo.

39:14.917 --> 39:17.616
- How you doing, Sam?
- I'm fine.

39:17.659 --> 39:22.664
Just a little banged up.
What about Josh?

39:22.708 --> 39:23.926
- I gave him the meds.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.493
But Riley was with him
the whole time.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.583
- I'm just glad you're back.
- Lucas here was a godsend.

39:28.627 --> 39:29.932
We ran into him in the woods.

39:29.976 --> 39:31.804
- Oh, right place, right time.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.414
- What were you doing
out there?

39:33.458 --> 39:37.157
- I fell in that hole, ended up
about a mile from here.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.506
- We have to lie you down.
- Yeah.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.334
Let's get him in the bus.
- I got this. Thank you.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.683
- Come on.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.090
- I've been looking for you.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.787
- What the hell
are you doing here?

39:58.831 --> 40:00.223
- Fell through the sinkhole
just like you.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.138
- No, you're supposed
to be in Baton Rouge.

40:02.182 --> 40:05.446
- I got a tip you were in LA
about to make a deal.

40:05.490 --> 40:06.534
I came to stop you.

40:06.578 --> 40:07.883
- Oh, so you're following me?

40:07.927 --> 40:09.798
- I'm not gonna let you
throw your life away.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.452
- You're not a part
of my life anymore.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.412
You don't get a say in it.

40:14.455 --> 40:18.677
Stay away from me.

40:21.854 --> 40:25.118
- Is that the guy
you were trying to find?

40:25.161 --> 40:27.163
- Yep.

40:27.207 --> 40:28.600
- Who is he?

40:28.643 --> 40:31.820
- He's my son.

40:31.864 --> 40:36.434
- [groaning]

40:41.787 --> 40:43.702
- I'm gonna see if I can
find you some more water.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.011
- Hey. Thank you. Both of you.

40:52.232 --> 40:54.190
- What else can I do?
What do you need?

40:54.234 --> 40:56.584
- I just need to relax.
That's all.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.194
- Mom.

40:58.238 --> 41:00.545
- Josh.

41:00.588 --> 41:03.504
Josh. Hey, sweetheart.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.550
How you doing?

41:05.593 --> 41:08.553
- A little better.

41:08.596 --> 41:12.513
- You still have a temperature,
so you should rest, all right?

41:12.557 --> 41:15.516
- I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.213
- I know.

41:23.698 --> 41:27.267
I love you so much.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.355
- I love you too.

41:31.924 --> 41:35.536
[dramatic music]

41:35.580 --> 41:36.885
- What do you think?

41:36.929 --> 41:38.278
- Looks like you've been busy.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.367
- It's a Striker prototype
designed specifically

41:40.410 --> 41:42.761
to fly down
into one of these sinkholes.

41:42.804 --> 41:44.893
- I've never seen
anything like it.

41:44.937 --> 41:47.417
- We've been developing it
for years.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.028
We've been trying to get
the go ahead to launch

41:49.071 --> 41:51.683
a rescue mission,
but we couldn't.

41:51.726 --> 41:53.032
Until now.

41:53.075 --> 41:55.774
- What changed?

41:55.817 --> 41:57.906
- You.

41:57.950 --> 41:59.560
Now that we know
where it leads,

41:59.604 --> 42:03.782
now that we know people are
alive, everything's different.

42:03.825 --> 42:09.744
We're going down there,
and you're gonna help us do it.
