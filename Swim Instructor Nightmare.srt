00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,037
So, how'd I do?

11
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,622
Better, right?

12
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,874
Actually, you're two seconds
slower than your top speed,

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,877
which, as I've told you before,
subpar.

14
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,505
That can't be.

15
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,590
I've been practicing
day and night.

00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,599
I've hesitated saying this
for a long time, but...

18
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,768
you just don't have
what it takes

19
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,436
to compete in the Summer Games.

20
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,764
Coach, this is
my whole purpose in life.

21
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,525
I have to be the best.

22
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,818
I have to be.

23
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,904
Please, give me another chance.

24
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,490
I've given you more chances
than anyone I've coached.

25
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,827
I'm sorry, I really am.

26
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,412
I have what it takes.

27
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,997
And you know it.

28
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,917

Sabrina, don't do that.

Come on.

Sabrina.

32
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,467
We've gone over this before.

33
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,226
I'm married.

34
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,136
And even if I wasn't married,

35
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,104
I'm too old for you.

36
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,398
No, you're not.
You're perfect for me.

37
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,608
I think you need to go.

00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,975
Coach, please, I love you.

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,527
You know how much
I love you.

00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,145

-Work.

53
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,052
Doing what?

54
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,021
Teaching brats
to swim, okay?

55
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,731
You satisfied?

56
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,108
Yes.

57
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,985
And you should be too.

58
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,153
It's great you're finally
doing something--

59
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,113
Great?

60
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,031
It's an insult.

for the big leagues,

and now I'm just a...

63
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,904
Well, we both know why
you lost your shot

64
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,164
at the big leagues.

65
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,407

75
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,054
I guess the inflatables
gave me away.

76
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:47,962
Yeah.

77
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,264
Let me wash up.

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,299

Ashley.

What would you like to drink?

83
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,322
Oh, water's fine.

84
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,482
You'd think since I swim in it
I'd hate the stuff,

85
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,617
but no.

00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,035
[Parker]
Great.

87
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,628
I'll be right back.

of the princess?

I did, she's really pretty.

95
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,819
Totally takes after her mom.

96
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,738
Anyways.

97
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,326
My wife, Ellen,
had this beautiful pool built.

98
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,913
Because she thought it would be
great for family time.

99
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,498
Absolutely.

100
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,958
Yeah, and then there was
an incident

101
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,751
and now Ashley's afraid
of the water.

102
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,211
[dark music]

103
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,546

00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,581
Um...

105
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,082
It's okay if you
don't want to tell me,

106
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,135
but it might help me
to figure out

107
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,252
how to reach her.

108
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,763
Have you tried to teach Ashley
to swim yourself?

109
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,758
Yeah. I can't even get her
near the water.

110
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,936
And, um... how 'bout your wife?

111
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,897
Did she try?

112
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,648
Yeah, about that.

113
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,650
My wife, Ellen, um...

114
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,736
She's away for a while.

115
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,778
Oh.

116
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,280
Where is she?

117
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,909
Uh, she's with family.

118
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,953
[Ellen]
The job just started
to wear me down.

119
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,084
Pretty soon, I was...
drinking to face trial dates.

120
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,880
And then the worst day of all.

121
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,466
[somber music]

122
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,127
I had told
my 10-year-old daughter

123
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,263
that I'd give her
a swimming lesson.

124
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,634
But I was drunk
and I passed out.

125
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,394
[inhales sharply, sighs]

126
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,606
Ashley decided
she could swim anyway.

127
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,445
I'm lucky my husband
was home that day.

128
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,314
I don't know
what would have happened

129
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,366
if he wasn't there.

130
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,913

to protect her baby.

131
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,335

132
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,838
And I'm an alcoholic.

00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,556

137
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,365
One second.

138
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,293
Ash, I know you're in there
and I know you can hear me.

139
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,704
I asked this nice young lady,
Sabrina,

140
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,173
to maybe give you
some swim lessons.

141
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,466
What do you say?

142
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,430
[mouths]
Let me try.

143
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,064
Hey, Ashley.

144
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:09,983
I'm Sabrina.

145
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,570
You know, I was just like you
at your age.

146
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,614
You couldn't get me
near a pool.

147
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,410
But then... one day
this great swimming teacher

148
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,370
helped me get over my fears
and now--

149
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:26,166
And now... Sabrina is training
for the Summer Games.

150
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,461
The Summer Games?

151
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,546
The real Summer Games?

152
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,247
That's right.

153
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,383
And if you wanted,

154
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,802
maybe one day you could be
on the national team too.

155
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,306
But we're never gonna know
unless you get in the water.

156
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:45,602
'Kay.

157
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,187
All right then.

158
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,563
Go on and get into your swimsuit

159
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,522
and I'll meet you outside.

160
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,696
[soft, eerie music]

161
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,423
All right.

162
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm gonna sit right over there
at that patio table.

163
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:19,761
And...

164
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,514
[dreamy music]

165
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,265
do my...

166
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,439
work, but I'll keep an eye
on you the whole time, okay?

167
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,903
All right.

168
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:38,947
Now.

169
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,700
First thing we're gonna do
is touch the water.

170
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,702
[sighs]

171
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,791
See?

172
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,043
The other teachers
tried that same trick

173
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,294
and it didn't work.

174
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,968
Well, let's try stepping
into the pool together.

175
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,512
I'll hold your hand
the whole time.

176
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,460
Here, let's try
something different.

177
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,419
May I?

178
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,504
Come here.

179
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,257
Good job.

180
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,258
There we go.

181
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,389
Okay.

182
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,216
This is gonna take
a whole lot of courage,

183
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,893
but I know you can do it, okay?

184
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Watch me first
and then you try.

185
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,816
[soft music]

186
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,320
All right, you watching?
You ready?

187
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,364
[blows bubbles]

188
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,950
[Ashley laughs]

189
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,954
All right, come on.

190
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,039
It's not bad, I promise.

191
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,165
Come on.

192
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,385
All right, you ready?

193
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,638
One, two, three.

194
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,558
[laughing]

195
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,311
All right, now splash me,
come on.

196
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,763
No, a real one!
Splash me, come on.

197
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,898
[laughing]

198
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,598
Come on.

199
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,318
[laughing, splashing]

200
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,703
[humming dreamily]

201
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,209
[eerie music]

202
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,260
[distant humming]

203
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,810
You're doing it again.

204
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,478
What? What am I doing?

205
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,906
[soft, tense music]

206
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,576
You're obsessing
over some older man.

207
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,120
Who is he this time?

208
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,663
Oh, wait, I know.

209
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,791
The father of the "brat"
you had to teach.

210
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,002
So?

211
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,336
He's married, right?

212
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,588
That is none of your business.

213
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:42,881
[Khloe]
Oh, the hell it isn't.

214
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,801
I said that you could live here
as long as you promised

215
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,344
to never do this again.

216
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,763
But, Mom, this one
is perfect for me.

217
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:51,556
He's....

218
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,392
He's perfect.

219
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,560
Oh, Sabrina.

220
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,187
Your father left you.

221
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,064
And you going after
these older men

222
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,274
isn't going to bring him home.

223
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,776
[Sabrina]
Yeah, and you know why
Dad walked out?

224
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,903
Because of you.

225
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,356
You drove him out,
and I miss him every single day.

226
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,490
Miss him all you want.

227
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,867
He's never coming back.

228
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,862
And if you think you're gonna
find him in these other men,

229
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,206
-you're dead wrong.
-Parker is different.

230
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,042
His marriage is in trouble.

231
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:21,961
He needs me.

232
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,338
[Khloe laughs]

233
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,374
Okay, I'm gonna call
Dr. Gonzalez.

234
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,875
What? No.

235
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,510
He'll make me take
those pills again.

236
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,971
Yeah, you need to take
those pills again.

237
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,015
I don't need any damn pills.

238
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,933
Stop.

239
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,267
Give it.

240
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,269
Fine.

241
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,521
You don't want to get help?

242
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,390
Then you gotta call
this Parker

243
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,317
and tell him that you're gonna
turn down the job.

244
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,027
I can't do that.

245
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:49,864
I love him.

246
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,908
He's... he's the one.

247
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,541
[music intensifies]

248
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,795
What are you doing?

249
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,799
I said what are you doing?

250
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,347
I'm calling your client
and telling him you are unwell.

251
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,057
Mom.

252
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,685
Please don't ruin this
for me, please,

253
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,852
I am begging you.

254
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,897
This is for your own good,
Sabrina, and you know it.

255
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:32,740
You've gotta be kidding me.

256
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,741
Knock it off.

257
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,617
[grunts]

258
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,945
[panting]

259
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,288
[Parker]
This is Parker.

260
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,082
Hello? Hello?

261
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,668
This is Park--
[phone beeps off]

262
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,337
I said not to call him.

263
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,297
I told you don't call.

264
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,925
What is the matter
with you? Get up.

265
00:16:59,019 --> 00:16:59,809
Mom?

266
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,063
Mom?

267
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,815
Mom?

268
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,070
[grim music]

269
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,936
[water burbling]

270
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,861
[dramatic music]

271
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,023
[indistinct chatter, splashing]

272
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,618
[soft, tense music]

273
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,798
All right.

274
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,374
Snack time.

275
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,467
Here we go.

276
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,471
One for you.

277
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,183
Is this what you drink
when you're in the pros?

278
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,184
Yep.

279
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,313
Dad, can Sabrina stay
for dinner?

280
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,723
Ashley, I'm sure
she has other plans,

281
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,559
not to mention other students.

282
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,228
[Sabrina]
I could rearrange my schedule.

283
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,063
Oh, you don't have to do that.

284
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:36,897
[Ashley]
Please, Dad?

285
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,991
You can make
your famous pasta.

286
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,036
Famous pasta, huh?

287
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,906
Sounds great.

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,501
[crickets chirring]

289
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,412
And, fortunately, I was
working from home that day

290
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,414
and just happened to check on
Ashley's progress.

291
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,092
I mean, had I shown up
a minute later...

292
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,594
Oh my God, no.

293
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:03,257
Yeah. So, that's why Ashley's
afraid of the water,

294
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,518
and that's when
Ellen and I decided

295
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,311
she needed to go to rehab.

296
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,765
Sorry, I didn't feel comfortable
telling you sooner,

297
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,110
-so I wasn't--
-No, no, it's okay.

298
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,905
Can I tell you something else?

299
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,365
Of course.

300
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,441
[sets drink down]

301
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,276
[soft music]

302
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,777
[sighs]

303
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,205
Ashley is the center of my life.

304
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,500
I haven't seen her
this happy in months.

305
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,669
It's all because of you.

306
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,755
Come on, I'm just givin' her
swim lessons.

307
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,757
No, I'm serious.

308
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,427
It's in the care and the concern
that you show for her.

309
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,554
I mean, you treat her
like she's your own.

310
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,724
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

311
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,149
Whoa, uh, I'm still married.

312
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,820
Oh my God, I...

313
00:19:58,823 --> 00:19:59,822
I'm so sorry.

314
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,907
Forgive me.

315
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,816
Look, I--I would be lying
if I was to tell you

316
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,244
that I'm not extremely attracted
to you.

317
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,157
But I'm still deeply committed
to my wife Ellen.

318
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,042
Of course you are.

319
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,545
I--I just got swept up
in the moment.

320
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,882
I guess I did too.

321
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,512
Ah, so, um...

322
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,640
See you tomorrow afternoon.

323
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,893
I'll be here.

324
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,773
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

325
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,819
[phone ringing]

326
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,115
[phone beeps]

327
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,692
Hey, babe.

328
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,193
Hi, honey.

329
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,663
Um, listen, I know
it's a little late, but...

330
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,873
[Parker]
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

331
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,501
[Ellen]
The doctor finally said
I'm ready to come home.

332
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,868
That's great.

333
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,837
[Ellen]
He says I can leave tomorrow.

334
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,540
I'll be there first thing
to pick you up.

335
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:00,716
[Ellen]
Thank you.

336
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,302
And how's my baby?

337
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,046
She's doing great.

338
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,475
I finally found her
a swim instructor.

339
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,185
Sabrina.

340
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,688
And she's training
for the Summer Games.

341
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,064
Ash loves her.

342
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:16,524
She's like a little dolphin,

343
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,401
I can hardly keep her
out of the pool.

344
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,780
[sighs]

345
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,156
What's the matter?

346
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,068
I wasn't there
for her first lesson.

347
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,161
Don't worry.

348
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,497
There'll be plenty more
to come.

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,165
See you in the morning?

350
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:34,458
Okay.

351
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,460
I'll be waiting.

352
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,878
I love you.

353
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,046
Love you too.

354
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,094
[aide]
I'll need your phone back,
please.

355
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,432
[clears throat]

356
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,685
[Ellen]
Thank you.

357
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,151
[soft, tense music]

358
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,255

360

Fiji.

361
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,739
How 'bout you, babe?

362
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,787
[dark music]

363
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,583
[soft music]

364
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,093
[Ashley]
Sabrina!

365
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:08,844
Hey!

366
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,304
Big surprise.

367
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,181
-Come on, hurry!
-Okay.

368
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:19,980
Wow.

369
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,484
-Okay, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

370
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,073
So, what's all this
about a big surprise?

371
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,283
Ellen's home.

372
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:32,860
Oh.

373
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,695
Yeah, it's a little unexpected,

374
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,364
so I would appreciate it
if we could be discreet

375
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,667
about our moment
the other night.

376
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:41,669
Of course.

377
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,037
Hey, I'm just here
for Ashley, right?

378
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,339
No worries.

379
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,842
Oh, wait.

380
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,594
[laughing]

381
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,545
[Ashley]
You're gonna [indistinct].

382
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,889
Like, on day one
we had a splash fight.

383
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,099
So much fun.

384
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,851
You're gonna be so proud of me.

385
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,185
Sabrina!

386
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,026
Nice to meet you.

387
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,278
My name is Ellen.

388
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,696
So happy to meet you.

389
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,063
-I'm Sabrina.
-I know!

390
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:13,367
All I've been hearing since
I've been back is, "Sabrina!"

391
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,570
Thank you so much
for teaching Ashley how to swim.

392
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,080
My pleasure.

393
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,167
Well, I've got to go
to a business meeting,

394
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,252
so I'm gonna let you ladies
get acquainted.

395
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,462
Make me proud.

396
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,249
So, ready to show your mom
how great you are?

397
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,259
I will.

398
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,594
All right, let's go. Let's go.

399
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,147
[laughing, indistinct chatter]

400
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,109
Come on.

401
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,750
Did you see me, Mom?

402
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,586
[Ellen]
Didn't take my eyes off you
for a second!

403
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,588
You're doing great.

404
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,091
That's because Sabrina
is such a great teacher.

405
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,626
[laughs]

406
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,386
Am I ready for the pros yet?

407
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,971
You're gettin' there.

408
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,467
[Sabrina]
So, um, I usually bring
some snacks

409
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,603
for Ashley to enjoy
after the lesson.

410
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,522
Oh, how thoughtful of you.

411
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:28,734
There we go.

412
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,821
Granola bar and sports drink
for our world champion.

413
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,032
And for the adults.

414
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,955
One for you and one for Parker.

415
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,916
Oh, my gosh, no, of course not.

416
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,126
These are for you and Parker
to enjoy after dinner.

417
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,044
[Ellen]
Mm.

418
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,172
Thank you, but we can't have
these types of drinks

419
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,173
in the house.

420
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,841
Oh, why not?

421
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,512
I'm on the program.

422
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,097
Oh. Oh my gosh.

423
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,391
I'm--I'm so sorry,
I didn't know.

424
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,518
I'm sure you didn't.

425
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,649
Well, I'll see you tomorrow
for our next lesson, 'kay?

426
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:09,817
'Kay.

427
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,521
Actually, I'll--I'll call you
to schedule the next lesson.

428
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,447
Oh, you don't have to do that,

429
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,283
I'll just show up
at our regular time.

430
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,577
I'll call you to schedule
the next lesson.

431
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,529
But I've been teaching Ashley
for three times a week

432
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,530
for the past month.

433
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,532
She's been making
such great progress.

434
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,209
[Ellen]
And we appreciate that.

435
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,169
I'll call you.

436
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,337
Got it.

437
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,090
[tense music]

438
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,979
[engine revs]

439
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,982
You are going to love
going back to rehab, Ellen.

440
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,732
[Parker]
So what are your thoughts
on Sabrina?

441
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,201
Ashley's not having
a lesson tomorrow.

442
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,786
I canceled it.

443
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,164
It's obvious that Sabrina
is a little more interested

444
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,875
in you than giving Ashley
a swimming lesson.

445
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,087
[Parker]
I'm sorry?

446
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,089
You lost me.

447
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,717
I saw the two of you
talking to each other.

448
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,469
And?

449
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,254
What, you think
she's interested in me

450
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,015
because we were talking
to each other?

451
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,016
No.

452
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,393
Because she was
straightening your tie.

453
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,436
The hell
was she doing that for?

454
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,772
Come on, I told her
I had a business meeting.

455
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,523
She probably noticed
it was crooked.

456
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,566
[laughs]

457
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,935
Yeah, I'm sure
that's not all she noticed.

458
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,864
Babe, Sabrina and I
discuss Ashley's progress,

459
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,774
I pay her,
that's it.

460
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,910
Over a couple of cold beers?

461
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,620
What?

462
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,664
She brought over snacks
for Ashley

463
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,115
and two bottles
of craft beer

464
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,950
she claims were for you
and for me.

465
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,585
Now, why would she do that?

466
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,286
I don't know.

467
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,455
She brings over snacks
and drinks all the time.

468
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,466
She was probably being friendly.

469
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,462
I was a divorce lawyer,
remember?

470
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,132
I can spot women like her
from the next town over.

471
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,851
Is this how we're gonna
celebrate you coming home?

472
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:10,637
Just...

473
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,690
[sighs]

474
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,358
answer one question.

475
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,442
What?

476
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,444
Did you tell her
I was in rehab?

477
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,572
Why would you do that?

478
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,033
That is not something
that she needs to know.

479
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,244
[Parker]
I'm sorry. You're right.

480
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,995
It was a moment of weakness.

481
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,206
Okay.

482
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:35,587
But then... why would
she offer me a beer if...

483
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,341
if she knew I had a problem?

484
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,836
Look, I don't think
she was being malicious.

485
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,513
She probably forgot.

486
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,684
Babe, the main thing is she's
helped Ashley's confidence,

487
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,103
Ashley adores her,
and now she can swim.

488
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:55,983
Honey.

489
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,819
Get out into the world again.

490
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,237
Find a new job.

491
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,364
Volunteer. Do something.

492
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,742
But don't worry about Sabrina.

493
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,870
She's here to teach Ashley.

494
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,290
She's helped her a lot,
and that's all we need to know.

495
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,337
[birds chirping]

496
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,549
[dark music]

497
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,177
[sighs deeply]

498
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,805
[phone ringing]

499
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:27,890
Hi.

500
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,308
Steve?

501
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,384
Ellen Scott here.

502
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,895
Linda?

503
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,387
Hi!

504
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,606
Yeah, Ellen Scott.

505
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,557
Oh, you're--you're in a meeting?

506
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,861
Listen, I was calling
because I'm, um,

507
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,229
ready to get back to work.

508
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:43,897
You don't do family law anymore?

509
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,240
Oh, okay.

510
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
I'm sorry, I...

511
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,994
[sighs]

512
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,704
Listen, is Mr. Stafford in?

513
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,748
I wanted to let him know
that I'm currently looking--

514
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,419
No, I am not still in rehab.

515
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,268
[grunts softly]

516
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,817
[soft, dark music]

517
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,947
[sighs deeply]

518
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,327
[soft music]

519
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,262
[sighs]

520
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,070
[soft, tense music]

521
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,675
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

522
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,477
Surprise!

523
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,440
We, uh...
we weren't expecting you.

524
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,516
Well, I don't mean
to interrupt,

525
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,352
but the last time
I came over,

526
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,187
I think I must have dropped
my sunglasses

527
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,697
somewhere in your backyard.

528
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,199
Can I have a quick look?

529
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,329
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

530
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,164
Wow.

531
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,499
Sounds like someone's
having a good time.

532
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,700
Yeah.

533
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,669
Look, I meant to call you.

534
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,872
Ellen decided that
Ashley's progressing so well

535
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,841
that she's ready
to go to the next level.

536
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,510
Great, I've arrived
just in time.

537
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,347
With someone else.

538
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,307
[soft, tense music]

539
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,558
What?

540
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,269
Yeah, um, we decided to get
a medal-winner to teach her.

541
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,103
Hold on...

542
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,940
I may not have a medal yet,

543
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,225
but I'm training
for the national team

544
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,903
every single day
of my life.

545
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,947
You can't just go switching
a teacher on a kid

546
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:30,864
like that suddenly,

547
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,407
it's not good for them.

548
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,735
I was also hoping
that we could sit down

549
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,746
and map out a plan for Ashley.

550
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,291
There's so much
I wanted to teach her.

551
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,589
Uh... thank you for helping her
as much as you did.

552
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,302
Can I at least
tell her goodbye?

553
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,223
[sighs]

554
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,559
[water splashing]

555
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:03,939
Hey.

556
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,433
Sabrina thinks she left
her sunglasses here

557
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,235
-the other day.
-Hey there.

558
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,988
Mind if I have quick look?

559
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,575
No. Go ahead.

560
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,831
How's she doing?

561
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,457
She's doing great.

562
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,792
Having a lot of fun.

563
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,086
I gotta jump, okay?

564
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,381
[soft, dark music]

565
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,141
Well, I can't find
those darn sunglasses.

566
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,767
Who knows where
I might've left 'em.

567
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,970
Anyway,
Parker mentioned

568
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,314
you found someone new
to teach Ashley.

569
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,402
I thought I'd say goodbye,
but...

570
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,701
I can't believe it.

571
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,654
Donna Dean.

572
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,166
The Donna Dean,
bronze medalist?

573
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,042
That's me.

574
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,626
And the gold medal's up next.

575
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,586
[laughs]

576
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:08,661
Great.

577
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:09,996
Donna's gonna help me
get to the Summer Games.

578
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,841
I saw you, little dolphin,
you're doing great!

579
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,427
[Ashley]
Mom, I have to use the bathroom.

580
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,972
Okay, but don't run,
and don't get water everywhere.

581
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,512
So, I hear
you got Ashley started.

582
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,347
Yeah, but, I mean,
how great for her

583
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,066
that you're teaching her now.

584
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,984
By the way, I'm a huge fan.

585
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,069
Well, thank you.

586
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,487
[dark music]

587
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,322
Wait, don't I know you?

588
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,024
You two know each other.

589
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,034
[Donna]
I remember now.

590
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,827
You were training
for the national team

591
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,662
with Coach Sharky
about a year ago.

592
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,364
I used to stand
on the sidelines sometimes

593
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,698
and watch everybody.

594
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,168
-Wait, who?
-Coach Wallace.

595
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,869
Sharky is his nickname.

596
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,671
Best swimming coach
in town.

597
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,550
But then you suddenly
had to leave the team.

598
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,344
What was that all about?

599
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,804
[intense music]

600
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,389
[water gurgling]

601
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,722
Are you angry with me?

602
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,566
What? No. Of course not.

603
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,484
My mom thought
it would be good

604
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,277
for a real medalist
to teach me.

605
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,229
That's why Donna's here.

606
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,240
Well, your mom is a smart woman.

607
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,067
You know,
if Ashley were my daughter,

608
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,120
I'd fire me and hire Donna.

609
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,329
You would?

610
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,372
Oh, hell yeah.

611
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:25,905
Oops.

612
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,165
[giggles]

613
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,627
I just wanted to say goodbye.

614
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,796
Keep up the great work, okay?

615
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,415
[soft music]

616
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,717
You have a fantastic teacher.

617
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:42,973
Okay.

618
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,518
Look.

619
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,232
It's obvious that
you bonded with Ashley.

620
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,400
And...

621
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:57,195
well, if you have the time, uh,

622
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,447
why don't you drop by
for Ashley's next lesson

623
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,116
and hang out with us.

624
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,659
I mean, if you want to.

625
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,661
I'd love to.

626
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,872
And just so you know...

627
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,291
Ashley was my best student.

628
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:10,617
Really?

629
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:11,960
Yeah, I mean,
look at her.

630
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,045
She's a natural.

631
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,466
Thank you.

632
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,296
And thank you for being
such a great sport about this.

633
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,306
Of course.

634
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,851
Ashley's in great hands
with Donna.

635
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,105
[Ellen]
Yeah, she is.

636
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,974
Go enjoy
your daughter's progress.

637
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,443
I'll show myself out.

638
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:43,700
Perfect.

639
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,827
Perfect.

640
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:54,044
[dark music]

641
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,140
Can't wait to redo this place.

642
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,768
[airplane engine roaring]

643
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,184
[Parker]
Well, Sabrina took that better
than I thought she would.

644
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,736
[Ellen]
And she said she'd love

645
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,364
to stop by and hang out
for Ashley's lessons.

646
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,657
Oh, really?

647
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,033
[laughs]

648
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,536
I'm sorry I jumped the gun
on Sabrina.

649
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,830
She really does seem
like a sweet young woman.

650
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,790
[Parker]
Told ya.

651
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,874
Mm.

652
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,167
See you tomorrow night?

653
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,461
[Parker]
Unless you've changed
the locks on the doors.

654
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,170
Mm.

655
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,510
I bought something sexy to wear.

656
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,545
In that case,
I'm definitely comin' home.

657
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,379
[chuckles]

658
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,473
[Ellen]
Oh, before you go.

659
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,050
Do you remember that photo
of the three of us

660
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,103
that was above the fireplace?

661
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:54,896
It's gone.

662
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,057
Babe, there's a lot of photos
above the fireplace.

663
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,694
Yeah, but this one was taken
after I got back from rehab.

664
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,445
The first time.

665
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,365
Wait, yeah,
I do remember the photo,

666
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,117
but... I don't know
where it is.

667
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,569
We'll find it
when I get back, okay?

668
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,405
I just don't understand
why it's not there.

669
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,373
It's always there.

670
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,750
Honey, you go to sleep.

671
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,243
I'll see you tomorrow.

672
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,838
-Love you.
-Love you too.

673
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:25,260
[energetic music]

674
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,636
[crickets chirring]

675
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,743
[tapping]

676
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,515
[tissue paper rustling]

677
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,978
[birds chirping]

678
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,615
[typing]

679
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,123
[doorbell rings]

680
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:40,460
[laughs]

681
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,336
Hey!

682
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,962
I'm here to hang out
with you

683
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,547
for Ashley's lesson
with Donna.

684
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,883
Uh, you're a day early.

685
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,343
Donna doesn't get here
till tomorrow

686
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,095
and Ashley's still not back yet
from school.

687
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,004
Agh, darn it.

688
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,182
Must have gotten my dates
mixed up again.

689
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:58,395
Anyway, I stopped by
this super cute bakery

690
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
and picked up some
gourmet cookies for everyone.

691
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,014
[Ellen]
Yeah, I know that place.

692
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,850
Wilka's, we go there
all the time.

693
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,351
Everything they make
is so great.

694
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,611
I know!

695
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,491
Well, since you're here,
come on in.

696
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,659
I'll make some coffee.

697
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,860
Great!

698
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:16,413
[soft, dark music]

699
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,916
[Ellen]
So you're all right switching
off lessons with Donna?

700
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,369
We'll try it
and see how it goes.

701
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,172
Oh, absolutely,
I think it's a great idea.

702
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:29,467
Honestly, thank you for even
keeping me on the team.

703
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,640
Oh, I hope peanut butter
chocolate chip's okay.

704
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,475
You won't get any argument
from me.

705
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,697
Oh, uh, Sabrina, um...

706
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,900
there's...

707
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:54,826
Thank you.

708
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,704
something that's been
bothering me.

709
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:01,458
The other day when you
brought over the, um...

710
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,076
-The beers?
-Yeah.

711
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,796
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

712
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,466
Parker told me
and I just wasn't thinking.

713
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,426
Can you forgive me?

714
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,094
Oh, of course.

715
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,388
It's just that,
as you know,

716
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:18,600
I can't have any substances
in the house.

717
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,394
No... alcohol.

718
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,025
Mm, no... prescription
painkillers.

719
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,601
No weed.

720
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,403
I completely understand.

721
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,362
Now...

722
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,158
You gotta share
the guilt with me.

723
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:44,959
Uh-uh, these are for you
and your family.

724
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:47,212
I bought some for myself
and it is gonna take

725
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,288
absolutely
all of my willpower

726
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,174
not to eat them
before I get home, so...

727
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,384
Well, in that case,

728
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,295
these are going
in the cupboard for later,

729
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,431
otherwise they'll be gone
before Parker and Ashley

730
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,098
even get here.

731
00:41:59,184 --> 00:41:59,974
[laughs]

732
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,643
Polish them off,
they'll never know.

733
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,769
[Ellen laughs]

734
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,562
Joking, joking.

735
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,105
Oh.

736
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,816
[sinister music]

737
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:11,819
Ah.

738
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,115
Uh...

739
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:16,658
Gosh.

740
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:17,450
[laughs nervously]

741
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,869
Is everything all right?

742
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,622
Uh, I--I...

743
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,825
Can I get you anything?

744
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,327
[eerie sound effects]

745
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,756
I think I need to lie--lie down.

746
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,633
[eerie sound effects]

747
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,304
Can you see your--
see yourself out?

748
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,055
Sure.

749
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:40,673
Do you need me to help you?

750
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,933
[eerie sound effects]

751
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:44,343
No, I...

752
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,354
You're not looking so good.

753
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,159
[eerie music]

754
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:28,730
Sweet dreams.

755
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:31,357
[tense music]

756
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,710
Perfect timing.

757
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,582
Hey, little dolphin,
how was school?

758
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,468
[Ashley]
Oh, Sabrina, hi, it was great!

759
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,348
Uh, where's my mom
and why are you here?

760
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,602
She had a little headache
so she's taking a nap,

761
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,762
and I'm here
because I thought today

762
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,314
was your lesson with Donna.

763
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,107
My bad.

764
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:17,153
Anyway, I was about to leave
unless you want to show me

765
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,030
what Donna's been teaching you.

766
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,281
Yeah, wanna see?

767
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,872
[Sabrina]
All right, girly,
work that water,

768
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,281
let me see what you know.

769
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:30,625
Let's go, come on.

770
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,669
Yes, Ashley, look at that!

771
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,754
Oh my gosh, look at you!

772
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,839
You look so good.

773
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:38,758
Oh, my gosh!

774
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:39,759
Oh, look at you!

775
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,128
Keep going, keep going,
don't stop now!

776
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:44,463
Yes, girl, yes!

777
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,766
Good job, I'm so proud of you.

778
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:47,466
How did I do?

779
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,643
Excellent.

780
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:49,519
I wanna do it again.

781
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,973
You should,
but I gotta go now.

782
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,775
I don't wanna get out
of the pool yet.

783
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:57,643
You don't have to.

784
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,987
But my dad says
no unsupervised swimming

785
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,406
or else he gets angry.

786
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,533
You know what?

787
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,819
If you want to swim,
go ahead.

788
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,654
I'm not gonna say anything.

789
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:10,823
It'll be our big girl secret,
'kay?

790
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:11,999
'Kay!

791
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,545
[Sabrina]
Just, uh, stay closer
to the shallow side for me.

792
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,495
Promise?

793
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,630
Promise.

794
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,011
[dark music]

795
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,318

[water splashing]

803
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:01,567
Honey!

804
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:04,529
Baby!

805
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,199
Babe?

806
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,871
[music intensifying]

807
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,711
[water splashing]

808
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:23,840
What are you doing?

809
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,291
I'm sorry, Daddy, I was just--

810
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:26,717
[Parker]
What did I tell you?

811
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,127
No unsupervised swimming.

812
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,129
Yeah, and where's your mom?

813
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,964
Resting, she had a headache.

814
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,975
Then why are you
in here by yourself?

815
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,686
I don't need supervision.
I can swim, I--

816
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,938
[Parker]
Get out of the pool right now.

817
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,858
Ash, I'm not gonna say it again.

818
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,069
Baby.

819
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:48,030
[solemn music]

820
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,076
Baby, wake up.

821
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,498
[groaning]

822
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,326
Oh, where am I?

823
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,044
Tell me you haven't
been drinking.

824
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,630
No, of course not.

825
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,343
Did you know Ashley
was in the pool by herself?

826
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:10,928
Huh?

827
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,505
[she sighs]

828
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,308
You've been drinkin' again.

829
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,727
I can't believe it.
I cannot believe it.

830
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,562
[Ellen]
I... I wasn't drinking.

831
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,398
I trusted you,
and you did it again!

832
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,443
I... I wasn't, I swear.

833
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:28,779
Oh!

834
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,782
Where'd you hide it this time?

835
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,576
I know you put it somewhere.

836
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,153
[she groans]

837
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,067
Look what I found
underneath the sofa.

838
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,744
Now, why would it be there?

839
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,788
I don't... I don't know.

840
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,164
Yes, you do!

841
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,740
You put it there!

842
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,418
Ashley was in the pool, alone!

843
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:27,672
One of us is supposed
to be out there

844
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:30,216
watching her at all times,
you know that.

845
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,677
I... I swear, I...

846
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,930
I didn't even know she...
came home.

847
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:38,516
[she groans]

848
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,727
You blacked out.

849
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,358
No, baby, that's impossible.

850
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,026
I... I... I...

851
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,447
You're gonna have to go back.

852
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,775
[Ellen]
What? No! Please.

853
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,610
[Parker]
We're not gonna lose Ashley

854
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,913
because you can't control
your drinking problem.

855
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,281
[Ellen]
I can't go back.

856
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,116
[sobbing]

857
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,461
-This is Parker Scott.
-No, no, please! Please!

858
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,787
[unintelligible]

859
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,464
No, no!

860
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,801
Please, I can't go back!

861
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,928

[he sighs]

865
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,787
I'll check in on you every day.

866
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:44,540
Ashley.

867
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,044
Honey, honey, honey, honey.

868
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,337
I know.

869
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,048
You gotta get in the car.

870
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,845
[somber music]

871
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,193
[engine starting]

872
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,681
[engine starting]

873
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,398
We lost Mom again.

874
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,559
[sighs]
Yeah.

875
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:55,861
She just wasn't ready yet,
that's all.

876
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,364
Will she ever be ready?

877
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:01,867
[he sighs]

878
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:06,038
I don't know, Ash,
but right now,

879
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,998
it's best that
she be near people

880
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,741
who can take care
of her properly.

881
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:11,743
I can take of her!

882
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,712
I want to take care of her!

883
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,422
I know you do.

884
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,134
I do too.

885
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,919
But first, Mom has to learn

886
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,388
to take care of herself.

887
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,768
Are you still mad at me?

888
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:29,728
A little bit.

889
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:32,314
But it's only because

890
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,234
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

891
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,529
I love you more than anything

892
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,738
in this world.

893
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,031
You understand?

894
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,201
-I'm sorry, Daddy.
-Come here.

895
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:46,579
-I'm sorry!
-It's okay.

902
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,822
Look, everyone, it's Donna Dean,

903
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,659
world-famous bronze medalist.

904
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,127
How'd you get in here?

905
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:36,795
You didn't read the sign?

906
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,998
"Professionals only."

907
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,333
The exit's over there.

908
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,845
I'm not going anywhere until you
agree to stop teaching Ashley.

909
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,972
I'm Ashley's teacher, not you.

910
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,175
Besides, I'm better than you.

911
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,810
[laughing]

912
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,022
Okay... prove it.

913
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,148
You're on.

914
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,734
[tense music]

915
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,178
[splashing]

916
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:28,806
[intense music]

917
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,646
[water bubbling]

918
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,505
See? I am the best teacher
for Ashley.

919
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,881
[Donna laughs]

920
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,174
What is so funny?

921
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,259
[Donna laughs]

922
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,886
[tense music]

923
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,060
What are you laughing at?

924
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:16,687
You think you got fired

925
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,856
because you weren't
a good enough teacher?

926
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:22,100
It's because you wouldn't stop
hitting on Mrs. Scott's husband.

927
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:25,404
-That's not true.
-Uh, yeah, it is.

928
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,940
Mrs. Scott told me herself
the first day I was there.

929
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,993
Yeah, well, did she also
tell you she's in rehab

930
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,870
'cause she's walking around
drunk half the time?

931
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,663
Oh, that's rich,

932
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,957
coming from a pathological liar?

933
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,210
You say you're training
for the Summer Games?

934
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:42,463
You haven't even been
on Coach Sharky's team

935
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,839
for over a year.

936
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,508
Yeah, word on the street is

937
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:49,461
you suddenly had to leave
'cause you kept hitting on him.

938
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:52,431
You don't know anything!

939
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,059
Maybe I don't know
exactly what happened

940
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:58,637
because I wasn't there,
but here's my guess:

941
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:00,305
You tried to hook up with him,

942
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:03,359
but he told you to get lost,
and you didn't like it.

943
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,613
That's it, isn't it?

944
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:10,282
Isn't it?

945
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,038
That's why they won't let you
on the national team!

946
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,790
You got a reputation!

947
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,159
Oh, Sabrina's a bad girl!

948
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,994
Look, I loved Coach, okay?

949
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,380
I loved him!

950
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,332
And he was gonna ruin my life!

951
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,927
I had to teach him a lesson,
I had to!

952
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,513
You had to do what?

953
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,599
Teach him a lesson?

954
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:37,976
You're sick.

955
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,312
I'm not letting you
anywhere near that kid

956
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:41,346
or that family.

957
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,357
I'm calling them right now.

958
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:57,195
[grunting, screaming]

959
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,789
[splashing]

960
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,249
[intense music]

961
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,875
[splashing]

962
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,383
[gasping]

963
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,304
[groaning]

964
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:25,232
[dark music]

965
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,161
Guess you'll never get
the gold now.

966
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,009
[ominous music]

967
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:06,523
[water splashing,
dishes clinking]

968
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:08,775
[laptop chiming]

969
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,363
[gentle music]

970
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:18,911
[sighs]

971
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,115
-Hey.
-Hey.

972
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,043
[Sabrina]
Been a couple weeks
since I saw you,

973
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,544
so I thought I'd check in.

974
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,754
[Parker]
Thanks.

975
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:30,547
How are you?

976
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,050
I heard the news about Donna.

977
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,676
It's unbelievable.

978
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:37,554
The police say she was taking
anabolic steroids,

979
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,431
say her heart just gave out.

980
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,725
How's Ashley taking it?

981
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,301
Not well.

982
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,637
She hasn't wanted to go
near the pool since.

983
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,314
Look, if you think
it would help,

984
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,690
I would be happy to come over

985
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,567
and give Ashley
some catch-up lessons.

986
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:53,237
I mean, if that's all right
with Ellen.

987
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,313
Actually, it doesn't matter

988
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,324
whether Ellen's okay with it
or not.

989
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,244
She's back in rehab.

990
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:04,081
What? She seemed perfectly fine
the last time I saw her.

991
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,825
-What happened?
-I wish I knew.

992
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,336
The thing is,
Ellen was always able

993
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:12,005
to hide her problem really well.

994
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,050
But this time...

995
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,837
I don't know,
she must've gone on a bender.

996
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,389
I've never seen her like that.

997
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,560
-I'm so sorry to hear this.
-Thanks.

998
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,480
Well, if you really have
the time,

999
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,607
I'm sure Ashley would love
to see you again.

1000
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,110
I think some lessons from you
would cheer her up.

1001
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,778
And vice versa.

1002
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,615
-This afternoon okay?
-Sure.

1003
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,619
Great. I'll see you later.

1004
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,122
[clicks]

1005
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,791
[sighs]

1006
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:49,960
Perfect.

1007
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:53,297
[ominous music]

1008
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,140
That's right, yeah.

1009
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,383
Down kick, then keep
your legs straight,

1010
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,643
then do the up kick.

1011
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:09,554
[bright music]

1012
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,315
Yeah, keep kicking around...

1013
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,727
Nice, nice.

1014
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,946
[splashing]

1015
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:20,324
[indistinct]

1016
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:23,910
[phone ringing]

1017
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,211
[splashing]

1018
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:41,637
Hi. How are you today?
Feeling better?

1019
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,556
[Ellen]
I... still don't feel
like myself.

1020
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:45,590
Not even close.

1021
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:46,600
[sniffling]

1022
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:49,019
But I... I had to call

1023
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:52,064
and see how Ashley was doing
after Donna...

1024
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:56,101
I can't even bring myself
to say it.

1025
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:59,437
Yeah, well...
Ash took it pretty hard,

1026
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,272
so I decided
to bring back Sabrina.

1027
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:04,159
I don't know what it is,
but those two have a bond.

1028
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:06,662
Anyway, Ashley's smiling again.

1029
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:09,790
I don't think it was a good idea
to rehire Sabrina.

1030
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,750
I... I don't follow.

1031
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,286
[Ellen]
That day
when she brought over the beers,

1032
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:17,589
she knew I was on the program.

1033
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,424
You told her.
She didn't forget.

1034
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,802
She--she brought those beers
on purpose.

1035
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:23,962
You remember that

1036
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,630
but you don't remember
passing out

1037
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,057
in the middle of the day

1038
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,518
with our daughter
in the pool by herself.

1039
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:31,812
I don't know what happened,

1040
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,188
but I swear,

1041
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,857
I was not drinking that day,
I wasn't.

1042
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:38,143
Instead of fixating on Sabrina
bringing over those beers,

1043
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,644
why don't you come clean
about the fact

1044
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:40,904
that you were drinking that day?

1045
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,447
I wasn't drinking!

1046
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,482
[intense music]

1047
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:45,909
And I don't know what happened,

1048
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,078
but I think Sabrina
did something.

1049
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,871
Just like she did
with those beers,

1050
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,990
she... she did something.

1051
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:53,491
You're not making any sense.

1052
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:54,835
[Ellen]
I can't remember.

1053
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:57,421
-Yeah, because you blacked out.
-No.

1054
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,214
Trust me, I swear, I...

1055
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,674
[Parker]
I can't!

1056
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:03,501
Sabrina is trouble.

1057
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,303
She's the one who's lying.

1058
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,639
Yeah, well, she's not the one
that left our daughter

1059
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,182
in the pool unattended.

1060
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,352
Baby, I--I swear. Please.

1061
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,687
[Parker]
I've gotta go.

1062
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,109
[sobs]

1063
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:22,070
[Parker]
You're teaming up
on me now, okay.

1064
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:24,114
[laughter]

1065
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,857
Can you come back tomorrow?

1066
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,492
Oh, tomorrow, I don't know.

1067
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,494
Let me... let me check.

1068
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,037
[gentle music]

1069
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,998
It's looking like...

1070
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:34,958
I can make it.

1071
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,084
Yes!

1072
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,920
Can Sabrina stay for dinner
tomorrow night too?

1073
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,299
Ash, we can't take
all of her time.

1074
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:44,134
Why not?

1075
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,046
[Parker]
We'll see.

1076
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,381
For now, brush your teeth
and get to bed.

1077
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:52,267
Only if Sabrina tucks me in.

1078
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,230
Be right back.

1079
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,278
[laughing]

1080
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:12,162
Did your mom ever tuck you in
when you were a kid?

1081
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:16,166
No. My mother
never really had time for me.

1082
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,292
[tender music]

1083
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:18,919
She didn't really love me.

1084
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,174
What is it, sweetie?

1085
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:27,919
I don't think my mom
loves me either.

1086
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:30,222
[Sabrina]
Of course she does.

1087
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:31,723
No, she doesn't.

1088
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:33,758
She's never here,

1089
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,435
she keeps making mistakes.

1090
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,687
Ashley, we all make mistakes.

1091
01:03:38,524 --> 01:03:40,431
Your mom loves you,

1092
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:41,983
and your dad does too.

1093
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:44,269
Do you know how lucky you are

1094
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:45,904
to have such a fantastic dad?

1095
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:50,700
Last time I saw my dad,
I was five years old.

1096
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,787
He used to take me swimming.

1097
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,832
He and my mom
were always arguing.

1098
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,834
He was trying his best,

1099
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:02,295
but... it was never good enough
for her.

1100
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:04,381
He couldn't take it.

1101
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:08,051
One day, packed his suitcase,

1102
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:11,429
kissed me goodbye,
and I never saw him again.

1103
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,766
I think about Daddy every day.

1104
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:19,187
I wish I could bring him back,
but... I can't.

1105
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:25,193
Anyway, trust me.

1106
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,154
Your mom and dad love you.

1107
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,324
And so do I.

1108
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,991
Good night, little dolphin.

1109
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,002
Good night, big dolphin.

1110
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:43,628
[laughing]

1111
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,842
Let's see, all right.

1112
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:01,313
We have candles...

1113
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,181
That's for the diffuser.

1114
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:07,018
Where's the diffuser?
There it is, okay, um...

1115
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:10,864
Wait, you brought
all this here for me?

1116
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:12,157
[mellow music]

1117
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,241
Stress relief.

1118
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:16,786
This stuff helps,
and trust me, you need it.

1119
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:24,202
There is... one more thing
you should do.

1120
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:26,338
[water splashing]

1121
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:39,643
Doesn't this feel great?

1122
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:40,977
It does.

1123
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,722
You know, you should give
yourself daily swim breaks.

1124
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,224
I mean, you clearly work out.

1125
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:47,317
[chuckles]

1126
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,028
Mainly weights and jogging.

1127
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,614
Okay, so,

1128
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,449
make swim dates
with your daughter then.

1129
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:55,867
I bet she'd love that.

1130
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,329
That was actually
my original plan.

1131
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,081
Thank you for reminding me.

1132
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:06,962
Race you to the other side?

1133
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,583
[splashing]

1134
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:15,512
[intense music]

1135
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,899
[laughing]

1136
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,236
Okay.

1137
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:33,697
You win.

1138
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:35,782
I'm no match for you.

1139
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,118
I bet you could be.

1140
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:53,633
Sabrina...

1141
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:55,885
That's my name.

1142
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:58,847
I forgot to mention...

1143
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:02,225
this is the other way
to relieve stress.

1144
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,065
[laughing]

1145
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,111
[soft music]

1146
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,979
You have to get up early?

1147
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,532
No, I can sleep in.

1148
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,828
-Good.
-Yeah, but this coming Tuesday,

1149
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,289
I have to go to New York
for two weeks.

1150
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,460
Yeah, lately I pay the neighbor

1151
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,879
to look over Ashley
while I'm gone, but...

1152
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,799
I'll do it.

1153
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:36,801
You would?

1154
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,304
You could stay here.

1155
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:43,600
I would love that.

1156
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,408
I've been reading a lot
about substance abuse.

1157
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:02,702
Addiction.

1158
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:07,415
Ellen, you, and Ashley
will be dealing with this

1159
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,626
for the rest of Ellen's life.

1160
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,505
[sighs]

1161
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,552
You're always telling me
you have to think

1162
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,881
about Ashley's future,
but... she deserves a mother

1163
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:28,553
who's reliable,
who's gonna be there for her.

1164
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,687
Doesn't she?

1165
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:33,858
She does.

1166
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,903
I could be that for her.

1167
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:55,588
[Ellen]
I don't even remember
how I got here this time.

1168
01:08:57,092 --> 01:09:01,136
But I do know...
I never want to be here again.

1169
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,429
I love you all,

1170
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:07,091
but... I miss my family,

1171
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,601
and I want to go home.

1172
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,761
[solemn music]

1173
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:15,099
My name is Ellen Scott,
and I'm an alcoholic.

1174
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,101
[applause]

1175
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,361
Good job.

1176
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,154
[sighs]

1177
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,030
Vicky, why don't you go next?

1178
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:24,659
Mm, sure, um...

1179
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,037
I started drinking
when I was 12.

1180
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:30,790
My friend invited me over
and her parents weren't home,

1181
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,542
so we thought
that it would be cool

1182
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,785
to drink some
of her dad's beers,

1183
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,754
and then we drank some more.

1184
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,216
It was fun,
and we just kept drinkin' 'em.

1185
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:42,177
We turned on the TV,
and they were showing

1186
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,511
that old movie, Jaws.

1187
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:44,596
[dark music]

1188
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,182
Okay, maybe some of you
don't remember it,

1189
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:50,852
but it was about
this huge killer shark.

1190
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:54,472
[voice echoing]
Huge killer shark.
Huge killer shark.

1191
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:57,567
Huge killer shark.
Huge killer shark.

1192
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,277
[Donna]
You were training
for the national team

1193
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:01,145
with Coach Sharky
about a year ago.

1194
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,864
-Wait, who?
-Coach Wallace.

1195
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,782
Sharky is his nickname.

1196
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:07,652
[Vicky]
And it really gets me
because my niece is 12 now

1197
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:08,870
and when I--

1198
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,371
[Ellen]
Excuse me.

1199
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:11,206
Hey, Ellen.

1200
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:13,249
Hey, we're not done yet here.

1201
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,799
Jerry, could I use my phone
for a minute?

1202
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,334
Good afternoon to you too.

1203
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,169
You know the rules:
Phone calls only

1204
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,222
during scheduled times
with supervision.

1205
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:30,683
It's my friend's birthday

1206
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,728
and... last year I forgot it.

1207
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,680
I just want to send her a text

1208
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:37,732
and let her know
how much she means to me.

1209
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:42,237
I just need a minute... or two.

1210
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,490
I'll be standing
right here in front of you.

1211
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,161
Two minutes. Go.

1212
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:02,131
[phone ringing]

1213
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,385
[Jerry]
Reception.

1214
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,179
He's doing what?

1215
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:10,598
Well, where's the--

1216
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,883
Okay, you know what, never mind.

1217
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:13,977
Coming up.

1218
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:18,439
Lucky you, I got a situation
on the third floor.

1219
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:20,057
You just bought yourself
two more minutes.

1220
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,150
Thank you.

1221
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:28,899
[phone dialing]

1222
01:11:28,994 --> 01:11:30,451
-Hello?
-Hi!

1223
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,370
Coach Sharky Wallace?

1224
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,738
[Coach Sharky]
Yeah, who's this?

1225
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:36,073
Hi, my--my name is Ellen Scott.

1226
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,242
I'm--I'm calling about a swimmer

1227
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,169
that you coached last year,

1228
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:42,714
a young woman by the name
of Sabrina Jameson.

1229
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,133
[Coach Sharky]
I can't discuss
my students with strangers.

1230
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,592
-Goodbye.
-Hello?

1231
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,678
Coach Sharky?

1232
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,263
Hello?

1233
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,473
[sighs]

1234
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,172
[car beeping]

1235
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:30,511
[dramatic music]

1236
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:43,775
[birds chirping]

1237
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,235
[Parker]
You looking forward
to seeing Charlotte today?

1238
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:48,321
That's why I love Saturdays
so much!

1239
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:51,574
And her mom always makes us
popcorn when we watch movies.

1240
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,910
[gentle music]

1241
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,496
Hey, how would you feel

1242
01:12:56,623 --> 01:13:00,500
about Sabrina spending
a little more time with us?

1243
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,544
You mean, like, moving in?

1244
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,338
Not exactly.

1245
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:08,999
You know I have to go
to New York in a couple of days,

1246
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:12,336
so instead of dropping you off
at Mrs. Miller's,

1247
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,306
I thought maybe Sabrina
could come stay here with you.

1248
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,475
That'd be great,
I love Sabrina!

1249
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:22,847
Uh, then I guess...
Mom's not coming back?

1250
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:23,815
[sighs]

1251
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,483
Of course she is.

1252
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,486
But I just don't know when.

1253
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,489
Meanwhile, it might be nice

1254
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,741
to have Sabrina around here
a little more,

1255
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:35,359
if that's okay with you.

1256
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,861
It's okay.

1257
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:40,206
[Parker]
Good, but Sabrina

1258
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,375
will never take the place
of your mom.

1259
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,419
I just want to be clear
about that.

1260
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:47,046
Dad, I know that.

1261
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,173
You have fun. If you need
anything, let me know, call me.

1262
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,675
Okay, I know.

1263
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,885
-I love you.
-I do too!

1264
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:53,878
Let me get the door.

1265
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:57,265
-Thank you, Dad.
-Thank you so much again.

1266
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,976
All right, you ladies have fun.

1267
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,102
[door closes]

1268
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,355
[bright, eerie music]

1269
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,233
[Sabrina]
Daddy...

1270
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:14,091
[intense, ominous music]

1271
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:26,479
[tense music]

1272
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:56,834
[Sabrina]
I stopped by
this super cute bakery

1273
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:58,928
and picked up gourmet cookies
for everyone.

1274
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,103
[Ellen]
Coach Sharky?

1275
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,357
-Yeah, who are you?
-Oh, I...

1276
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:15,695
I am sorry to bother you, but...

1277
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:17,363
You're the one who called
earlier, aren't you?

1278
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,240
Yes, but please let me explain.

1279
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,535
A few months ago,
my husband hired Sabrina

1280
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,528
to give our daughter
swimming lessons.

1281
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,032
Sabrina said that she was
training for the Summer Games,

1282
01:16:28,126 --> 01:16:31,168
but later, I found out
that she wasn't

1283
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,588
and she hadn't been
for a year.

1284
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,967
I am convinced that Sabrina
has been lying to us.

1285
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:41,429
My husband doesn't think so,
but I do.

1286
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,598
Please, can you help me?

1287
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,217
[Coach Sharky]
I feel partially responsible.

1288
01:16:47,312 --> 01:16:52,398
I just... I didn't think
that she'd continue with the...

1289
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:56,068
Continue to what?

1290
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,487
Sabrina was one of my students.

1291
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:01,324
She showed some promise
in the beginning,

1292
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:04,702
but then she started
to have some issues.

1293
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:08,205
[intense music]

1294
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,665
[Sabrina]
You're perfect for me.

1295
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:12,910
You know how much I love you!

1296
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:14,745
I've always loved you!

1297
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,590
[splashing]

1298
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,357
You're the first person I told.

1299
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,934
I didn't call the police
because,

1300
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,819
even though she tried
to kill me,

1301
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:41,530
I felt guilty
about kickin' her off the team.

1302
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:44,241
I mean, I didn't want
to completely destroy her life.

1303
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,329
You were a lot more generous
than I would've been.

1304
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:53,292
Later, I found out that I wasn't
her first, um... obsession.

1305
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:55,878
She has a thing for older men,

1306
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,505
and if they reject her,

1307
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,548
she freaks out
and tries to kill 'em.

1308
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:01,884
[dramatic music]

1309
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:05,888
I think one of those older men
happens to be my husband.

1310
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:08,307
[phone ringing]

1311
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:12,478
Everything okay?

1312
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,804
Listen to me carefully

1313
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:15,606
and do not hang up.

1314
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,141
What's goin' on?

1315
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:19,360
You sound like you're in a car.
Where are you?

1316
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,361
[Ellen]
That's not important.

1317
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,364
I just talked
to Sabrina's old coach.

1318
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,649
What? Why?

1319
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:26,817
Why would you do that?

1320
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,953
[Ellen]
I remembered something
Donna said.

1321
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,746
It came rushing back
to me today.

1322
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,990
Sabrina stopped training
for the Summer Games

1323
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:36,043
and had to suddenly leave
her team a year ago.

1324
01:18:36,129 --> 01:18:37,253
I had to find out why.

1325
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:40,172
Sabrina told me she's been
training every single day.

1326
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,799
[Ellen]
Yeah, well, she hasn't been.

1327
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:44,176
Okay, well, maybe she said that
just to get the job.

1328
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,262
One way or another,
Ashley can swim now.

1329
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,430
[Ellen]
Listen to me.

1330
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:50,015
Her coach said he had to kick
Sabrina off the team

1331
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:51,684
because she kept hitting on him.

1332
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:53,343
When he rejected her,

1333
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:55,396
she tried to kill him!

1334
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:58,515
Hello, did you hear what I said?

1335
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:00,317
She tried to kill him!

1336
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:03,821
I... I can't believe that.

1337
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,189
Yeah, well, you better.

1338
01:19:05,283 --> 01:19:06,407
He wasn't the first one.

1339
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,618
It's a pattern she has
with older men who reject her.

1340
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:12,037
Be straight with me,
have you been drinking?

1341
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:14,415
[Ellen]
I am stone-cold sober!

1342
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,366
That's the other thing.

1343
01:19:16,461 --> 01:19:19,203
I remember that day now clearly.

1344
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:20,963
I didn't drink anything!

1345
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:24,633
Sabrina came over with
a box of cookies from Wilka's.

1346
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,877
I had some, she didn't,

1347
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,346
because she laced them
with drugs.

1348
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,682
That doesn't make any sense.

1349
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:33,100
[Ellen]
Yes, it does!

1350
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:34,518
It all makes sense!

1351
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:37,855
She drugged me
to get me out of the picture

1352
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,441
because she wants
to get rid of me!

1353
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:44,069
Okay, well, how do you explain
the bottle of whiskey I found?

1354
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,529
[Ellen]
Sabrina put it there!

1355
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:46,822
It had to be her!

1356
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:50,234
Okay, I admit, I used to hide
bottles all over the house,

1357
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:51,401
but, under the sofa?

1358
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:53,904
Come on! That's for amateurs!

1359
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,664
[doorbell ringing]

1360
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:59,794
Hold on, someone's at the door.

1361
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:04,298
[door opening]

1362
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:07,218
Morning!

1363
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,094
-Business call.
-Okay.

1364
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:12,681
Listen, I...

1365
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,892
[Ellen]
She's already there, isn't she?

1366
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,927
Parker, she is dangerous!

1367
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,604
She cannot be
around you or Ashley!

1368
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:19,772
[Parker]
I have to go.

1369
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:27,947
[birds chirping]

1370
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,658
[grim music]

1371
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,422
It's a beautiful pool, isn't it?

1372
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:48,092
Yeah, it's perfect.

1373
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,011
Ash and I are gonna have
so much fun swimming in it,

1374
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:53,597
and even more fun
when you come back and join us.

1375
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:56,300
Yeah, you know,

1376
01:20:56,394 --> 01:20:59,353
I'm not leaving
until Tuesday though.

1377
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,813
It's only Saturday.

1378
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,897
Oh, I know.

1379
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:04,608
I just wanted to get
a head start, you know?

1380
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,735
Learn my way around the house,

1381
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,863
make sure I know
where everything is.

1382
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:10,489
For Ashley.

1383
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:15,652
By the way,
how's your training going?

1384
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:17,246
You know, for the Summer Games?

1385
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,990
-Great.
-I guess I should know this

1386
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,251
by now,
but how often do you train?

1387
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,497
-As often as I can.
-The reason why I'm asking is

1388
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:29,499
I was hoping I could consult
with your coach

1389
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:32,303
to see if I can get Ashley
into the accelerated program.

1390
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,013
She's been doing so well.

1391
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,765
I can look into that for you.

1392
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,510
That might be difficult, though,

1393
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:43,480
since you're not training
for the Summer Games.

1394
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,942
I don't like when people
lie to me, Sabrina.

1395
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,862
I'm not lying.

1396
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:53,616
Good, glad to hear that.

1397
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:56,368
I feel so much better.

1398
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,207
Although, Ellen told me

1399
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:04,293
that you brought over
a box of cookies.

1400
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:05,836
She ate them and you didn't.

1401
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,004
Why not?

1402
01:22:08,049 --> 01:22:09,298
I wasn't hungry.

1403
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:12,593
I'm thinking you didn't eat them
because you put drugs in them,

1404
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,803
and whatever you put in them
knocked Ellen out.

1405
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:16,546
That's crazy!
Why would I do that?

1406
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:19,183
So I would think Ellen
was drinking again, that's why.

1407
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,935
And that bottle of whiskey
under the sofa,

1408
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,686
I'm guessing
you didn't do that either?

1409
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:25,564
Everything's going so well.

1410
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:27,566
Why are you playing
this game with me?

1411
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,276
Why have you been lying to me

1412
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:31,737
from the moment
that you walked into my house?

1413
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,656
You were never training
for the Summer Games.

1414
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:34,573
You got kicked off the team

1415
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,075
because you tried to kill
your coach!

1416
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:37,234
That's not true!

1417
01:22:37,328 --> 01:22:39,069
Ellen tracked him down,
he told her everything,

1418
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:40,737
so don't lie to me anymore,
Sabrina!

1419
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,206
I wasn't trying to kill him!

1420
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,074
He was trying to kill me!

1421
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:48,078
I loved him, and he was trying
to walk away from me!

1422
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,414
But that--that doesn't matter
anymore,

1423
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:53,175
because I have you and Ashley.
Look...

1424
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:57,721
We're a family now.

1425
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:09,775
Sabrina, I don't know
what you're talking about,

1426
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,269
but you need to go right now.

1427
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:13,445
Go where?

1428
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,531
I gave up everything
to be with you.

1429
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,491
We're--we're gonna start
a new life together,

1430
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:19,368
you, me, and Ashley.

1431
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:22,246
I'm gonna say this
one more time:

1432
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,622
You need to go.

1433
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:26,750
But... but we're together now.

1434
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:28,452
You--you love me.

1435
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:29,920
Like hell I do!

1436
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:30,921
Get out!

1437
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:32,381
I'm calling the police.
