00:27.260 --> 00:29.570

00:46.990 --> 00:48.690

00:58.820 --> 01:00.920

01:17.230 --> 01:18.840
<i> Are you with someone? Are you busy?? Look at your messages~</i>

01:18.840 --> 01:20.300
<i>What happened to meeting today? Why can't I get in touch with you? Where are you?</i>

01:20.300 --> 01:25.490
<i>Like an intellectual once said, rather than an inner monologue,</i>

01:25.490 --> 01:28.070

01:52.480 --> 01:59.870
<i>This silent cry, which seems meaningless,</i>

01:59.870 --> 02:02.390
<i>exerts much greater influence than you expect.</i>

02:02.390 --> 02:04.160
Hye Ryeong, aren't you coming?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.880
Lee Hye Ryeong!

02:06.880 --> 02:10.039
Go ahead. I have to find something.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.360
We'll go ahead then.

03:25.070 --> 03:27.740
Welcome!

03:56.810 --> 03:59.820
I am Lee Hye Ryeong.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.420
I guess you already know me.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.090
No. I just guessed.

04:10.870 --> 04:17.089
I am curious as to how you found me.

04:17.089 --> 04:21.570
I saw on your social media that you are a regular customer here.

04:21.570 --> 04:24.450
- So I thought I'd wait until you came. <br> - That's reckless.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.990
I'm desperate.

04:27.770 --> 04:30.100
I'll just ask you.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.700
What is your relationship with Oppa Seung Yu?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.200
That is...

04:35.200 --> 04:38.990
something you should ask Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu personally.

04:38.990 --> 04:42.020
You shouldn't have come to me.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.460
I have no intention of breaking up with Oppa Seung Yu.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.060
So if you are dating Oppa Seung Yu,

04:50.060 --> 04:52.670
you should stop first.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.030
It's been an year since I met Oppa Seung Yu.

04:58.030 --> 05:02.870
He was my senior, but I fell in love at first sight and chased him.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.810
You really don't have to explain that me.

05:04.810 --> 05:09.550
Oppa and I... we were great

05:10.570 --> 05:13.010
until you appeared.

05:13.010 --> 05:17.860
I didn't know about you.

05:17.860 --> 05:21.480
Lee Seung Yu never told me about you.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.890
Now you know it clearly.

05:23.890 --> 05:27.880
So stop now.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.310
If you let go, then Oppa won't hold onto you.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.800
He's that kind of person.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.620
He must have just been curious about you.

05:38.620 --> 05:42.400
Don't you know that having this kind of conversation is uncomfortable?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.870
So what?

05:43.870 --> 05:47.540
I am uncomfortable with just the existence of you.

05:47.540 --> 05:51.850
I wanted to take care of this because I don't want this to become a big issue later.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.700
Big issue?

05:53.700 --> 05:57.810
So that you don't get the wrong idea that Oppa Seung Yu loves you.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.660
Betting your life on love,

06:01.660 --> 06:04.800
it'll only make it harder for you both later on.

06:11.730 --> 06:16.370
Unlike you, I'm not at an age to bet my life on love.

06:16.370 --> 06:20.200
Is age important when you love someone?

06:20.200 --> 06:24.140
Or do you just want to believe you're in control of your life?

06:39.340 --> 06:43.040
<i>We should have a party today.</i>

06:44.110 --> 06:45.890
<i>What should I do?</i>

06:46.680 --> 06:49.430
<i>I've made plans with my friends today.</i>

06:50.420 --> 06:52.140
<i>Sorry.</i>

07:06.070 --> 07:08.220
Why is it so hot?

07:08.220 --> 07:11.760
I wish some refreshing rain would come down.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.240
Why is this coffee so bitter?

07:19.510 --> 07:21.390
It's hot.

07:28.970 --> 07:33.350
You're so cute. Why does Lee Ran Ju not like you?

07:34.130 --> 07:36.090
Maybe not anymore.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.930
Huh?

07:39.280 --> 07:42.880
Did you... yesterday... the two of you?

07:45.520 --> 07:49.130
You must have had a great night.

07:52.150 --> 07:57.570
Someone is filming love and war over there, and another is filming a melodrama.

07:58.180 --> 08:01.400
The world is really something.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.840
But why does she have so much to say?

08:04.840 --> 08:08.450
Trash that is not even recyclable.

08:08.450 --> 08:10.440
Aigoo.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.660
Why did you make the coffee so bitter?

08:17.660 --> 08:19.530
You made the coffee.

08:21.520 --> 08:26.070
Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu is the one in charge of my work.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.720
Does that mean you will keep meeting him?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.630
I will have to meet him through work.

08:32.370 --> 08:34.320
Can you go now?

08:34.320 --> 08:37.559
This is a disturbance for my friend's shop.

08:40.539 --> 08:43.049
If I spoiled your mood, I'm sorry.

08:43.049 --> 08:46.240
Tell your friend that I am sorry too.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.910
But...

08:54.170 --> 08:56.850
did you really not know me?

08:59.900 --> 09:01.550
<i>Lee Hye Ryeong</i>

09:03.330 --> 09:06.440
<i>Who's calling at this hour? </i>

<i>Lee Hye Ryeong </i>

09:12.530 --> 09:14.440

09:17.400 --> 09:20.290
<i>I'm busy with work right now. I'll call you back later.</i>

09:24.800 --> 09:27.610
Or did you just pretend not to know?

09:27.610 --> 09:30.120
Or...

09:30.120 --> 09:32.500
you didn't want to know.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.600
Now you know clearly, right?<br> <i>Incoming call: Oppa Seung Yu</i>

09:45.900 --> 09:48.170
Yes, Oppa.

09:48.170 --> 09:51.340
Yes, I'm out now.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.590
It's okay.

09:54.590 --> 09:56.210
Okay.

10:01.610 --> 10:05.010
<i>The truth I knowingly ignored...</i>

10:06.010 --> 10:08.590
<i>I knew, so why...</i>

10:09.820 --> 10:15.390
Breathe out. Good! In.

10:15.390 --> 10:17.610
Ran Ju, you're doing great!

10:17.610 --> 10:20.170
Breathe out.

10:21.940 --> 10:25.430
Really good, Ran Ju!

10:27.140 --> 10:30.840
Wow, good. Really good.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.740
- Is there something good happening these days? <br> - Why?

10:38.740 --> 10:40.810
Your body let me know.

10:40.810 --> 10:43.960
Bodies don't lie.

10:43.960 --> 10:48.130
Since you're in a good mood, I want to make it better.

10:48.130 --> 10:49.850
Something better? What?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.870
A blind date. There is this really good person.

10:52.870 --> 10:56.770
I think he'd suit you really well.

10:56.770 --> 10:58.250
A blind date is a bit...

10:58.250 --> 11:01.610
Why? Are you dating someone?

11:01.610 --> 11:03.180
No, it's not like that.

11:03.180 --> 11:06.490
Then meet him once. He's a really nice person.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.570
Really!

11:13.620 --> 11:16.990
<i>I have no intention of breaking up with Oppa Seung Yu.</i>

11:16.990 --> 11:21.000
<i>So if you are dating Oppa Seung Yu,</i>

11:21.000 --> 11:23.490
<i>you should stop first.</i>

11:24.660 --> 11:28.480
<i>If you let go, then Oppa won't hold onto you.</i>

11:28.480 --> 11:30.800
<i>He's that kind of person.</i>

11:30.800 --> 11:33.670
<i>He must have just been curious about you.</i>

11:35.490 --> 11:37.670
<i>Did you really not know me?</i>

11:37.670 --> 11:40.520
<i>Or did you just pretend not to know?</i>

11:40.520 --> 11:42.180
<i>Or...</i>

11:42.930 --> 11:45.380
<i>you didn't want to know.</i>

11:46.630 --> 11:48.590
<i>Incoming call: Oppa Seung Yu</i>

11:48.590 --> 11:51.250
<i>Now you know clearly, right?</i>

11:52.810 --> 11:54.700
<i>Yes, Oppa.</i>

12:11.020 --> 12:12.930
Are you okay?

12:13.530 --> 12:14.450
Huh?

12:14.450 --> 12:17.790
I thought you would tear each other's hair out like you were fighting in the UFC.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.770
Let's go out.

12:27.570 --> 12:29.820
You trust me, right?

12:29.820 --> 12:31.790
Come with me.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.990
- Ah, it's spicy. <br> - I feel like my tongue is being ripped apart.

12:43.990 --> 12:48.630
- But it's... so tasty! <br> - So tasty!

12:49.650 --> 12:52.890
There's nothing like tteokbokki for stress.

12:52.890 --> 12:55.880
Indeed, you know your stuff.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.570
We should have called Ran Ju too.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.760
She is in a different league than us right now.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.640
There's no way she'd be craving something spicy right now.

13:03.640 --> 13:07.020
- If that's the case... <br> - Let's focus on this.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.710
Oh, it's spicy!

13:21.120 --> 13:23.670
<i>Whenever you call, I'll come running to you like this.</i>

13:23.670 --> 13:25.790
<i>I love you.</i>

13:28.700 --> 13:33.070
Things have been hectic for me since they've been reorganizing things at work recently.

13:33.070 --> 13:35.730
To meet a guy right now is a bit...

13:36.430 --> 13:38.300
He's a really great person though.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.410
Sorry. I know you were thinking of me.

13:45.980 --> 13:47.660
<i>Hyeong Jun Yeong</i>

13:48.900 --> 13:50.410
Hello.

13:50.410 --> 13:53.640
<i>Oh! It's my love, Miss Ran Ju.</i>

13:53.640 --> 13:57.070
Hey, are you really going to keep sending me these messages? It's annoying.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.530
Sorry.

14:03.530 --> 14:05.680
What for?

14:06.800 --> 14:09.940
It probably all came back to you after seeing me today.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.220
Memories of Kim Byeong Ho and that woman.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.570
Of course I thought of them.

14:17.630 --> 14:19.760
But that girl really is something.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.800
She actually came looking for you.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.260
She's desperate.

14:27.640 --> 14:32.450
Maybe I wasn't desperate then?

14:35.550 --> 14:38.770
Why? Do you regret it?

14:38.770 --> 14:41.370
No. Not at all.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.380
What about you?

14:48.410 --> 14:50.470
Are you hurt?

14:53.860 --> 14:55.810
I don't know.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.780
Since when did Seo Ji Won become the star of a scandal?

15:03.630 --> 15:07.680
When I didn't even know.

15:08.550 --> 15:11.630
That's how scandals start.

15:18.180 --> 15:22.400
So what are you going to do now?

15:26.180 --> 15:28.380
I should put an end to it.

15:29.730 --> 15:32.420
We didn't see each other for that long anyway.

15:38.870 --> 15:45.060
Since breaking up with Kim Jin Woo, he's the first guy you've dated in two years.

15:47.820 --> 15:51.230
Will you really be okay?

15:55.570 --> 15:58.800
Why is it like this every time?

15:59.640 --> 16:02.020
At first,

16:03.010 --> 16:07.070
I thought the men who hurt me were the problem.

16:07.950 --> 16:10.030
That...

16:11.600 --> 16:14.770
I'd just met men who were trash.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.160
But now,

16:36.660 --> 16:39.610
I feel like I've become a trash can.

16:42.220 --> 16:45.780
A trash can that's

16:47.250 --> 16:50.430
filled with dirty trash.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.210
<i>When love passes, I thought it would fade like a watercolor.</i>

17:12.210 --> 17:16.869
<i>Do you... like me?</i>

17:19.280 --> 17:21.710
<i>Your gaze right now...</i>

17:24.190 --> 17:25.270
<i>It confuses me.</i>

17:25.270 --> 17:29.050
<i>But my heart kept adding colors on top.</i>

17:29.700 --> 17:32.360
<i>I thought I'd only liked Ji Won.</i>

17:32.360 --> 17:36.460
<i>I like you, Seo Ji Won. I think I like you.</i>

17:36.460 --> 17:38.320
<i>I like you too.</i>

17:38.320 --> 17:42.050
<i>But then I realized what we had was love.</i>

17:42.050 --> 17:44.300
<i>This feels really nice, Seo Ji Won.</i>

17:44.300 --> 17:46.340
<i>This feels really nice, Seo Ji Won.</i>

17:49.140 --> 17:52.270
<i>Thanks for coming though.</i>

17:52.270 --> 17:56.380
<i>I can't let go of Seo Ji Won.</i>

18:15.670 --> 18:17.500
