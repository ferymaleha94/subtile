There are days like this also.

00:37.530 --> 00:41.750
I finish one series and get started on the next one right away.

00:42.460 --> 00:47.560
Seo Ji Won. Writer Seo Ji Won, you worked so hard!

00:47.560 --> 00:50.540
I'm proud of you. Good girl.

00:57.780 --> 01:01.490
Oh my, Seo Ji Won, you've gone crazy.

01:01.490 --> 01:05.080
Come to your senses! Ah, really.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.110
<i>Well, I didn't really miss you that much.</i>

01:36.750 --> 01:41.350
<i>- Is that so? <br> - Because I didn't know you'd grow up this well.</i>

01:49.380 --> 01:55.430
<i>Episode 2: Moderately Smart, Moderately Sophisticated</i>

02:01.810 --> 02:03.350
So were you upset?

02:03.350 --> 02:06.250
- About what? <br> - That I pretended to not know you at first.

02:08.110 --> 02:10.360
Did you really not recognize me?

02:10.360 --> 02:12.430
Did I change that much?

02:14.540 --> 02:18.570
Right. You've always been this cute.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.500
What are you saying?

02:22.170 --> 02:24.930
How could I not have recognized you?

02:24.930 --> 02:26.940
It was you after all.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.770
By the way, how did you end up becoming a webtoon author?

02:37.770 --> 02:41.580
Because my drawing skills are impressive.

02:41.580 --> 02:45.240
Wow, that confidence is pretty cool.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.780
I was really surprised.

02:47.780 --> 02:51.340
Who would've thought I'd meet you again as my manager.

02:52.910 --> 02:54.830
I applied for the position.

02:56.470 --> 02:59.280
I wanted to do it since it was your project.

03:01.660 --> 03:05.680
Besides, 'Like a Watercolor' is our story, isn't it?

03:25.810 --> 03:27.570
It's not.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.420
It's not our story.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.600
It really isn't?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.570
I'm telling you it's not.

03:40.570 --> 03:42.840
The male lead's name is Seung Won though.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.270
What?

03:44.870 --> 03:47.940
Seung Yu. Ji Won.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.150
When you put them together, it becomes Seung Won.

03:52.350 --> 03:55.130
What are you talking about?

03:55.130 --> 03:58.010
Well, one might think that.

03:58.010 --> 04:01.180
But that's not it.

04:02.020 --> 04:05.010
- Cha Seung Won! <br> - What?

04:05.010 --> 04:09.110
That's right, Cha Seung Won. I like the actor Cha Seung Won.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.590
That's why it's Seung Won.

04:11.590 --> 04:14.690
You don't believe what I'm saying right now, do you?

04:14.690 --> 04:18.279
If it were me, I'd be suspicious too, but it really isn't because of you.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.250
I really, really like Cha Seung Won.

04:20.250 --> 04:23.540
I've liked him for a long time that too. For real!

04:23.540 --> 04:25.250
I'm telling you, it's the truth!

04:25.250 --> 04:27.610
It's the truth, I said!

04:28.840 --> 04:32.150
Ah, this is so much fun! Teasing you like this.

04:32.150 --> 04:34.080
What are you saying?

04:36.850 --> 04:38.680

07:06.860 --> 07:10.250
It's very calm and like a fairy tale.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.550
But it oddly makes you nervous.

07:12.550 --> 07:14.350
It's exciting, isn't it?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.310
It's a romance story,

07:16.310 --> 07:18.920
but sometimes it feels more like a thriller.

07:18.920 --> 07:23.650
Especially the male lead. I don't know what he is thinking.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.410

I don't know what the female lead is thinking.

Oh yeah, Writer Seo Ji Won is really awesome.

10:08.130 --> 10:11.150
You said you wanted to treat me to dinner.

10:11.150 --> 10:14.920
Instead of that, just buy me some drinks. Both of us seem to like it anyway.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.460

10:18.460 --> 10:20.090
Yes.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.470
I mean... Why are you here all of a sudden, Assistant Manager Lee?

10:40.470 --> 10:43.610
I have some good news, and I wanted to tell you in person.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.990
Huh?

10:44.990 --> 10:49.910
'Psycho Bride'... got a movie proposal.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.540
A movie? Really?

10:52.540 --> 10:53.770
You're not kidding, are you?

10:53.770 --> 10:56.900
Shall we get congratulatory drinks?

10:59.150 --> 11:01.430
Oh my! Oh my!

11:08.450 --> 11:10.380
Sorry.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.380
Will you wait for a moment?

11:14.960 --> 11:16.130
Wait for me, okay?

11:16.130 --> 11:18.250
Take your time.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.470
Let's go.

11:28.560 --> 11:33.030
What's this? Is my face too bare right now?

11:33.030 --> 11:35.110
One second.

11:43.470 --> 11:47.140
Right, Ji won, however busy you are,

11:47.140 --> 11:49.810
you can't go out with a bare face.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.420
Let's take a look.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.050
Wait a minute.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.790
My hair has no life.

12:00.790 --> 12:04.210
I should have held onto it like this more.

12:05.980 --> 12:09.130
Hey Seo Ji Won, get a hold of yourself, will you?

12:09.130 --> 12:13.270
This isn't a date. Get a hold of yourself!

12:16.740 --> 12:18.700
Cheers!

12:22.160 --> 12:25.590
We should've gone to a better place. This is a celebration party after all.

12:25.590 --> 12:28.780
What's this, Assistant Manager Lee? How come you're getting so excited?

12:28.780 --> 12:34.340
Of course. As soon as I was in charge of the project, you received two contracts.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.000
So you're saying all of this is thanks to you?

12:40.000 --> 12:45.370
Even in the upcoming project, I'm the lead.

12:47.200 --> 12:52.400
Think about it carefully. The character's image is a lot like me.

12:52.400 --> 12:57.850
Hey, I made that character according to my liking...

13:00.520 --> 13:04.950
So that means I'm your type?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.410
No.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.280
It is true though.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.540
I said it's not.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.860
It is true!

13:11.640 --> 13:14.470
So a character that resembles me is what you like.

13:14.470 --> 13:15.880
I told you it isn't!

13:15.880 --> 13:18.100
It's Cha Seung Won! Cha Seung Won!

13:18.100 --> 13:19.310
Ah, Cha Seung Won?

13:19.310 --> 13:22.380
- It's true. <br> - It has nothing to do with him.

13:22.380 --> 13:23.850
Seriously!

13:23.850 --> 13:27.340
Why do you keep saying nonsense about it being Cha Seung Won? It's not.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.950
Okay.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.380
Welcome!

13:38.510 --> 13:40.350
We'd like to sit here.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.500

13:59.720 --> 14:02.030
Give us this one, please.

14:02.030 --> 14:04.260
Aren't you on a diet—

14:05.780 --> 14:07.840

14:09.580 --> 14:11.040

14:11.040 --> 14:12.660
Sure.

14:23.740 --> 14:26.840
- I'll go to the washroom. <br> - Okay.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.260
<i>500,000 won?</i>

14:37.430 --> 14:39.700

14:39.700 --> 14:41.510
Why are you meeting such a young guy?

14:41.510 --> 14:44.030
He looks young to you too, right?

14:44.030 --> 14:47.530
He looks young and handsome.

14:47.530 --> 14:49.520
You said he was a 35 year-old lawyer.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.730
No way? Are you on date number two today?

14:51.730 --> 14:56.420
Boss Hong, just make some money today.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.850
What is this?

15:18.080 --> 15:21.480
Not all that we ordered has come out?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.900
It won't come.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.010
Why?

15:24.010 --> 15:28.920
Don't worry. I'll pay for whatever we ordered earlier.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.230
So let go of your anger.

15:31.230 --> 15:35.760
The person who was supposed to come today had an emergency.

15:35.760 --> 15:40.520
As a substitute, I tried my best to keep you company so that you wouldn't feel bad.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.360
Sorry.

15:43.030 --> 15:46.900
Didn't they just send a random person?

15:46.900 --> 15:50.810
How do you look older than me? You look much younger than me.

15:50.810 --> 15:53.580
Does age matter?

16:07.950 --> 16:09.200
Boss.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.070
Yes?

16:14.630 --> 16:17.220
I'll pay.

16:17.220 --> 16:21.490
No. I will pay as an apology.

16:21.490 --> 16:23.480
Just pay for this as an apology.

16:23.480 --> 16:27.230
It's unfair for me to ask you to pay for everything,

16:28.800 --> 16:33.870
Don't look at me like that. I'm keeping this bottle to drink later.

16:42.070 --> 16:44.240
I'll ring this up for you.

16:49.330 --> 16:52.470
- Can you hold your liquor well?<br> - Yes.

16:53.770 --> 16:56.900
Even though things turned out like this, we can still drink.

17:08.410 --> 17:11.099
You look different from the broadcast.

17:11.099 --> 17:15.069
I hear that a lot. But don't fall for me.

17:15.069 --> 17:17.300
How much do you drink?

17:17.300 --> 17:20.240

17:41.270 --> 17:44.270
She's going to get herself in trouble that way.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.570
Lee Ran Ju, really.

18:02.450 --> 18:04.250
Hey!

18:05.840 --> 18:11.060
Okay, you do look exactly like that character right now.

18:11.060 --> 18:14.090
Finally, you're admitting it.

18:14.090 --> 18:16.950
You look like a middle school student right now.

18:16.950 --> 18:19.770
Didn't you say I'd grown up well?

18:19.770 --> 18:23.080
Me? When did I say that? I don't know what you're talking about.

18:23.080 --> 18:27.080
You are totally a kid.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.020
So is this how it goes?

18:29.020 --> 18:31.840
Lee Seung Yu is a baby. Baby!

18:34.560 --> 18:36.550
No way, you're already pissed?

18:36.550 --> 18:38.800
This is why we shouldn't play with kids.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.660
They're so childish. How can I—

18:51.300 --> 18:54.180
♫ <i>I don't know when it started</i> ♫

18:54.180 --> 19:00.100
♫ <i>Somehow when I didn't know, you came into my heart</i> ♫

19:00.100 --> 19:06.980
♫ <i> You became the shade and a place to rest </i> ♫

19:08.510 --> 19:12.770
♫ <i> After I met you, my day is </i> ♫

19:12.770 --> 19:14.570
Do I...

19:14.570 --> 19:16.130
♫ <i> completely filled with you </i> ♫

19:16.130 --> 19:17.600
still look like a kid?

19:17.600 --> 19:23.470
♫ <i> As if even fear is nothing at all </i> ♫

19:23.470 --> 19:26.790
♫ <i>You made it that way</i> ♫

19:26.790 --> 19:31.050
♫ <i>You are the only one who knows all my secrets</i> ♫

19:31.050 --> 19:35.170
♫ <i>You are my biggest gift</i> ♫

19:35.170 --> 19:38.090
♫ <i>Everything inside of me</i> ♫

19:38.090 --> 19:43.110
♫ <i>You and I, the feelings that won't change</i> ♫

19:43.110 --> 19:48.970
♫ <i>Time will be on our side, don't worry</i> ♫

19:48.970 --> 19:50.750
<i>How To Be Thirty</i>

19:50.750 --> 19:52.820
<i>You must have gone crazy, Lee Ran Ju!</i>

19:52.820 --> 19:54.710
<i>He's 24 years old.</i>

19:54.710 --> 19:57.840
<i>So this was the reason Hong Ah Yeong went missing?</i>

19:57.840 --> 19:58.560
<i>Lee Seung Yu.</i>

19:58.560 --> 20:00.110
<i>You're here, Writer Seo.</i>

20:00.110 --> 20:02.070
<i>He's going to be the director of 'Psycho Bride.'</i>

20:02.070 --> 20:03.400
<i>This is Director Cha Do Hoon.</i>

20:03.400 --> 20:05.030
<i>You're saying you're going to ruin this project because of money.</i>

20:05.030 --> 20:07.780
<i>Let's confirm this one thing and talk about it again later.</i>

20:07.780 --> 20:10.350
<i>If the woman keeps doing that, then the man gets confused.</i>

20:10.350 --> 20:11.540
<i>I want to confirm it.</i>

20:11.540 --> 20:13.210
<i>You waited a lot, right? What shall we eat?</i>

20:13.210 --> 20:15.710
<i>- I prefer eating alone. <br> - You don't like your boyfriend.</i>

20:15.710 --> 20:17.630
<i>You keep crossing the line.</i>

20:17.630 --> 20:21.040
