Assistant Manager Lee.

00:13.220 --> 00:16.700
Did you possibly do something wrong?

00:16.700 --> 00:20.310
Huh? What are you...

00:20.310 --> 00:25.840
Writer Seo wanted me to change her manager.

00:32.439 --> 00:36.410
Would you like me to talk to Writer Seo?

00:36.410 --> 00:38.470
I can ask why she is suddenly...

00:38.470 --> 00:42.860
I might have made her upset in some way.

00:42.860 --> 00:47.120
I'll try contacting her. Thanks for your concern.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.200
Let me know if you ever need my help.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.230
Sure.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.810
<i>Seo Ji Won, let's talk.</i>

01:19.100 --> 01:21.900
- I told you not to come to the office.<br>- Are you going to keep dating her?

01:21.900 --> 01:23.730
I told you that it's none of your business.

01:23.730 --> 01:25.850
Writer Seo Ji Won is different from me.

01:25.850 --> 01:29.570
She won't be able to accept you. Can't you tell?

01:29.570 --> 01:31.460
Hye Ryeong.

01:32.420 --> 01:35.510
It's over between us. Stop.

01:40.070 --> 01:42.830
Oppa, you weren't like this.

01:42.830 --> 01:46.180
Why are you sincere with Writer Seo Ji Won?

01:50.990 --> 01:53.110
I love her that much.

<i>Why is she pushing me away?</i>

02:36.080 --> 02:38.110
<i>Is it because...</i>

02:40.220 --> 02:42.730
The both of you seem to be really close.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.450
That's right. We have gotten closer, haven't we?

02:48.450 --> 02:52.480
We were discussing work right now.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.090
But I don't think you're here because of work, Assistant Manager Lee.

02:56.090 --> 02:59.700
It didn't look like you were discussing work with Director Cha Do Hoon.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.580
Am I mistaken?

03:02.580 --> 03:05.460
Am I wrong, Director Cha Do Hoon?

03:05.460 --> 03:10.870
I think you're misunderstanding the situation, Assistant Manager Lee.

03:23.890 --> 03:27.580
Director, let's continue our talk tomorrow. I'm sorry.

03:27.580 --> 03:31.330
It's alright. I'll call you tomorrow.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.380
Okay.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.200
What was that?

03:47.200 --> 03:49.170
You know about her, right?

04:17.760 --> 04:22.550
What would you have done if I had told you?

04:22.550 --> 04:25.000
It's over between us.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.410
Since when?

04:28.380 --> 04:31.300
I broke up with her after I started dating you.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.840
After starting to date me?

04:36.810 --> 04:42.220
Now I know why she came to me.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.440
She's young. She's just throwing a tantrum.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.550
Is love a tantrum to you?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.300
I'm serious.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.670
I don't know.

No matter what,

05:25.130 --> 05:27.450
I don't believe you.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.510
That's my answer.

05:38.460 --> 05:41.090
You should go now.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.760
I have nothing more to say to you.

No, Assistant Manager Yoon was saying so earlier.

Assistant Manager Lee, I hope you haven't misunderstood the relationship between Writer Seo and me.

So, something happened between the two of you that could be misunderstood?

Writer Seo, will you be able to find the time to do so?

17:30.320 --> 17:33.610
Well, yes, the director agreed to be understanding.

17:33.610 --> 17:35.710
I begged her to help me.

Gosh, you sure do know how to crack a joke.

17:38.970 --> 17:43.630
I'm not kidding. I didn't think it was possible for me to do it without Writer Seo, so I begged her to help me out.
