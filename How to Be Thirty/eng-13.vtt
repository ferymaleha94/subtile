00:11.820 --> 00:14.050
I didn't hear anything about it raining today.

00:14.050 --> 00:15.950
Didn't you say it was right around the corner?

00:15.950 --> 00:19.230
If it's close then we can just run. Writer Seo, can you run well?

00:19.230 --> 00:21.600
What? Well...

00:21.600 --> 00:24.680
You can go with me, Writer Seo.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.400
Oppa!

00:38.400 --> 00:40.170
Hello.

00:40.170 --> 00:44.890
I'm Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu's girlfriend, Lee Hye Ryeong.

00:56.900 --> 01:01.140
<i>Episode 13: The Best Love Affair</i>

01:02.560 --> 01:07.470
I had no idea Assistant Manager Lee had such a pretty girlfriend.

01:08.140 --> 01:11.440
Thank you. I guess he doesn't talk about me much.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.540
That's true.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.350
Assistant Manager Lee doesn't really talk about his personal life.

01:17.350 --> 01:20.400
Assistant Manager Lee, you built some walls around yourself.

01:24.170 --> 01:28.840
So I guess you didn't know that Writer Seo Ji Won was his first love either.

01:34.210 --> 01:39.690
Oppa Seung Yu and Writer Seo were each others' first love.

01:39.690 --> 01:41.800
Isn't that funny?

01:46.080 --> 01:52.580
So the reason you wanted to be in charge of Writer Seo's 'Like a Watercolor'...

01:52.580 --> 01:55.080
No way. Wow.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.530
Hey, my oppa isn't that kind of person.

01:57.530 --> 02:00.200
He's a very objective person.

02:03.410 --> 02:07.900
It's been a long time since they've seen each other.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.840
Isn't that right, Writer Seo?

02:11.690 --> 02:14.850
It seems like those drama-like things can happen sometimes.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.880
It was just nice seeing you again Assistant Manager Lee, isn't that right?

02:23.270 --> 02:26.670
More so than nice, I was happy to see you.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.570
I really wanted to see you again.

02:38.490 --> 02:43.380
All of a sudden the atmosphere is somewhat...

02:45.680 --> 02:49.580
But why did you want to change the manager?

02:49.610 --> 02:51.480
You don't need to do that.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.790
Now that everyone knows, we can work comfortably.

02:54.790 --> 02:57.000
Isn't that right, Writer Seo?

Ji Won.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.370
You still have something to say?

03:18.370 --> 03:19.470
Even after all this?

03:19.470 --> 03:23.640
- It's because she's still young. <br> - No, you're the one who's young.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.840
It's over so don't bother.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.020
Why are you being like this?

03:27.020 --> 03:29.810
I should be asking you that!

03:31.570 --> 03:36.180
Did you have fun putting me and Lee Hye Ryeong on your scale? Do I look easy?

03:36.180 --> 03:37.720
You know that's not true.

03:37.720 --> 03:42.270
I tried to understand you, but I can't.

03:45.070 --> 03:47.280
I thought of it too lightly.

03:58.840 --> 04:04.610
Please... just leave me out of your love games.

04:04.610 --> 04:11.060
Because I'm starting to hate myself for loving you for even a moment.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.430
Writer.

04:42.210 --> 04:45.670
Aren't you tired of being part of a third-rate drama?

04:47.950 --> 04:50.090
Do you want to do something fun with me?

05:21.010 --> 05:24.940

05:59.420 --> 06:02.800
<i>I would like to leave with a beautiful goodbye.</i>

06:03.630 --> 06:08.790
<i>Because the time we spent together was always blissful.</i>

06:10.230 --> 06:13.110
