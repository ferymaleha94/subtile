Ran Ju really loved that program.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.580
She might have acted cool,

00:29.390 --> 00:31.680
I envy Miss Ran Ju.

00:31.680 --> 00:36.110
She has a friend who cares so much for her and a cool guy like me too.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.410
You, leave just like this. Go.

00:42.410 --> 00:48.780
