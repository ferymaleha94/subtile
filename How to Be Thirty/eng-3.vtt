00:07.170 --> 00:12.370
Think about it carefully. The character's image is a lot like me.

00:12.370 --> 00:17.510
Hey, I made that character according to my liking...

00:20.480 --> 00:26.270
- So that means I'm your type? <br> - No.

00:26.270 --> 00:28.420
- It is true though. <br> - I said it's not.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.770
It is true!

00:30.770 --> 00:34.310
So a character that resembles me is your taste, Writer Seo?

00:34.310 --> 00:35.770
I told you it isn't!

00:35.770 --> 00:37.700
It's Cha Seung Won! Cha Seung Won!

00:37.700 --> 00:39.220
Ah, Cha Seung Won?

00:39.220 --> 00:42.330
- It's true. <br> - You are not very convincing.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.760
Seriously!

00:43.760 --> 00:46.460
Why do you keep saying nonsense about it being Cha Seung Won? It's not.

00:46.460 --> 00:51.730
Okay, right now you are just like that character.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.700
Finally, you're admitting it.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.650
You look like a middle school student right now.

00:57.650 --> 01:00.480
Did you forget that you said that I grew up well?

01:00.480 --> 01:03.810
Me? When did I say that? I don't know what you're talking about.

01:03.810 --> 01:07.690
You are totally a kid.

01:07.690 --> 01:09.620
So is this how it goes?

01:09.620 --> 01:12.600
Lee Seung Yu is a baby. Baby!

01:15.300 --> 01:17.190
No way, you're already upset?

01:17.190 --> 01:19.370
Ah, this is why I can't play with kids.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.260
They're so childish. How can I possibly play—

01:23.850 --> 01:30.960
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by <br> The How to Be Thirty Team @ Viki</i>

01:31.850 --> 01:33.850
Do I...

01:35.150 --> 01:37.310
still seem like a kid?

01:51.380 --> 01:54.130
What was that all of a sudden? <br> <i>Lee Hye Ryeong</i>

01:57.030 --> 01:58.740
Stop playing hard to get.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.640
What did I do?

02:00.640 --> 02:03.410
If the woman keeps doing that, then the man gets confused.

02:03.410 --> 02:06.320
It makes him want to get confirmation.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.190
What are you talking about?

02:10.070 --> 02:13.570
I'm saying you shouldn't confuse your boyfriend.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.930
- B-boyfriend... boyfriend? <br> - Just a moment.

02:25.220 --> 02:29.630
<i> 30-year-old Lee Seung Yu is a bit subtle.</i>

02:29.630 --> 02:34.500
<i> Episode 3: The Best Way to Draw the Line</i>

02:35.570 --> 02:38.510
Lee Ran Ju, really.

02:48.590 --> 02:50.080
Hey!

02:56.270 --> 02:57.830
Hey!

02:59.870 --> 03:03.110
Why are you here?

03:09.410 --> 03:11.880
I'm back.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.800
<i>Cheers.</i>

03:53.980 --> 03:56.330
What is this?<br> <i> [Closed]</i>

03:59.210 --> 04:04.670
Hong Ah Yeong! Hong Ah Yeong!

04:05.270 --> 04:07.280
Is it closed?

04:09.110 --> 04:14.180
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed. After the beep, you can leave a voice mail...</i>

04:14.180 --> 04:15.840
What is this?

04:28.650 --> 04:33.410
- Hello? <br> <i>- Hey Ji Won, have been in contact with Hong Ah Yeong? </i>

04:33.410 --> 04:37.250
Hong Ah Yeong. Her cafe is closed.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.780
Did she go to the early morning market?

04:38.780 --> 04:40.640
You know she doesn't go to the market anymore.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.070
She says it's cheaper on the internet.

04:43.070 --> 04:45.790
I wonder if something happened.

04:45.790 --> 04:48.880
But still, she wouldn't just close the cafe without a word.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.210
You're on your way to work, right?

04:52.210 --> 04:55.210
I'll try calling Ah Yeong. Don't worry and just go to work.

04:55.210 --> 04:58.170
Okay, text me.

04:58.170 --> 05:00.420
Ah, what could it be?

05:03.350 --> 05:05.890
Ah, what's going on?

05:05.890 --> 05:08.260
I don't know.

05:21.390 --> 05:22.450
Lee Seung Yu.

05:22.450 --> 05:24.980
You're here, Writer Seo.

05:26.510 --> 05:29.880
Ah, yes, Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.280
It will be helpful for you to refer to this for today's meeting.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.360
Sure, thank you.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.230
Let's head inside.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.100
- Ah, you're here. Hello. <br> - Hello.

05:52.760 --> 05:56.160
I'm Lee Seung Yu of SN Media.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.660
Ah, your company is very nice.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.270
Thank you.

06:00.270 --> 06:03.200
Over here is the director of "Psycho Bride."

06:03.200 --> 06:04.860
This is Director Cha Do Hoon.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.760
I am Cha Do Hoon.

06:09.980 --> 06:12.800
I am Seo Ji Won.

06:13.770 --> 06:17.380
<i>On Air</i>

06:18.710 --> 06:20.510
<i>Lee Ran Ju's World of Dreaming</i>

06:22.830 --> 06:25.690
<i>010-6357-015</i>

06:28.160 --> 06:29.990
- Hello? <br> - Oh!

06:29.990 --> 06:32.000
It's correct.

06:35.810 --> 06:39.000
I was worried that you might have given me the wrong phone number.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.050
I gave him my phone number?!

06:44.050 --> 06:47.940
- When? <br> <i>- Does age matter?</i>

06:49.660 --> 06:52.520
Lee Ran Ju, you must have gone crazy?!

06:52.520 --> 06:55.880
He is 24 years old!

06:55.880 --> 06:58.470
Oh my, what is this?

06:58.470 --> 07:01.130
Why does he keep calling?!

07:01.130 --> 07:05.000
<i>The person you are trying to reach cannot answer the call.</i>

07:14.220 --> 07:19.160
The place where the first murder occurs has a significant meaning,

07:19.160 --> 07:21.410
so I would like to recreate it as best as possible. Would that be possible?

07:21.410 --> 07:25.380
That was a foreign country, right? Was it Switzerland?

07:25.380 --> 07:28.410
- Yes. <br>- As I have already told you,

07:28.410 --> 07:31.190
location sponsorship is also a question of cost.

07:31.190 --> 07:34.160
That part could change depending on the direction of the adaptation,

07:34.160 --> 07:38.300
so let's just decide on the copyright and talk about it later?

07:38.300 --> 07:40.420
Miss Writer?

07:40.420 --> 07:43.500
Ah, sure.

07:46.470 --> 07:49.960
<i>Don't worry. I won't damage your work.</i>

07:49.960 --> 07:52.470
Then, shall we...

07:52.470 --> 07:55.420
Are you sure you are okay with it?

07:58.880 --> 08:03.120
- Excuse me? <br> - It will mean ruining your work because of the cost.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.710
- When an original work becomes dramatized, it usually— <br> - That's the company.

08:07.710 --> 08:11.260
Also, isn't the work too provocative?

08:11.260 --> 08:14.370
Hitting, stabbing with a knife, and killing.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.600
So?

08:15.600 --> 08:17.080
Let's take them out.

08:17.080 --> 08:22.480
- But, in a thriller genre—<br> - The way love is expressed is a thriller, not the love itself, right?

08:22.480 --> 08:25.160
There is only one reason why I agreed to do this project.

08:25.160 --> 08:29.330
It pretends to be provocative but it is emotional overall.

08:29.330 --> 08:32.620
I thought you as the writer would consider that a strength.

08:34.950 --> 08:39.490
- Thank you for the compliment. <br> - I guess you heard that as a compliment.

08:39.490 --> 08:42.799
I guess so. I guess that's how I heard it.

08:42.799 --> 08:46.040
This is because we all want this movie to go well, right?

08:46.040 --> 08:48.490
Of course. We're all passionate about this project.

08:48.490 --> 08:51.440
Passion is great. That passion.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.630
You all worked hard.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.860
- I have another engagement. <br> - I have another engagement.

09:04.090 --> 09:07.320
Of course. Everyone is so busy.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.320
Goodness.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.560
Wait for me.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.520
<i>Can you wait for me? Let's get something to eat once I'm done.</i>

09:40.520 --> 09:42.320
<i>You worked hard.</i>

<i>First floor.</i>

10:00.710 --> 10:02.960
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

10:13.520 --> 10:16.240
Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.470
Let's do our job properly, shall we?

10:18.470 --> 10:23.740
I don't want to mix my personal feelings with work.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.880
You must have been really upset earlier.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.130
I wasn't upset. I just wanted to let you know.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.130
Sorry. Let's talk over food.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.290
I think it's best I eat alone.

10:35.380 --> 10:39.290
Ah, your boyfriend must not like this.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.810
You keep crossing the line.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.630
Like now.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.890
Lee Seung Yu was just doing his work.

11:14.890 --> 11:16.200
♫ <i>The blowing breeze</i> ♫

11:16.200 --> 11:21.670
But why was I so bothered by it? Just why?

11:21.670 --> 11:27.950
♫ <i>I'll let you go even though I don't want to. Call me tonight.</i> ♫

11:31.520 --> 11:33.540
- Oh my god! <br> - What are you doing?

11:33.540 --> 11:36.730
Why are you here all of a sudden? I mean...

11:36.730 --> 11:39.670
- Something is going on with Hong Ah Yeong. <br> - What do you mean?

11:39.670 --> 11:42.370
She hasn't opened yet.

11:42.370 --> 11:43.890
Maybe she's sick?

11:43.890 --> 11:46.920
She takes 23 different supplements a day.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.600
- She can't earn money when she's sick. <br> - That's right.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.840
- So why did she close? <br> - That's why it's strange.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.130
What could it be?

11:56.130 --> 11:58.210
Long time no see!

12:04.040 --> 12:07.440
Ah, so this is the reason Hong Ah Yeong's missing?

12:07.440 --> 12:10.840
Missing? Why? Did she disappear?

12:12.610 --> 12:16.540
You crazy bastard! How dare you come here?

12:16.540 --> 12:18.140
- Wait, wait. <br> - Get lost, get lost!

12:18.140 --> 12:21.210
- Beat it! <br> - I'll go, I'll go!

12:24.370 --> 12:26.260
Oh, Lee Ran Ju, nice!

12:26.260 --> 12:27.960
Isn't he a crazy bastard?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.670
Get lost!

12:29.670 --> 12:33.310
How dare he come here? But where did Ah Yeong go anyway?

12:33.310 --> 12:35.900
Gosh, that crazy bastard.

12:35.900 --> 12:40.110
He's really crazy. How could he just show up there? He's so shameless.

12:40.110 --> 12:43.200
- We need to kill that bastard. <br> - What if Ah Yeong's not there?

12:43.200 --> 12:45.030
I'm pissed!

12:45.030 --> 12:46.700
- Calm down. <br> - I'm seriously so pissed!

12:46.700 --> 12:48.780
Ah, that angers me! I'm so irritated!

12:48.780 --> 12:52.710
Calm down. We have to stay alive.

12:52.710 --> 12:57.210
<i>Our thirties. The one who changed most was Ah Yeong.</i>

12:57.210 --> 12:59.950
<i>That's the worst!</i>

13:02.650 --> 13:04.040
<i>Hello.</i>

13:04.040 --> 13:06.470
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

13:06.470 --> 13:09.610
<i>We'll get going.</i>

13:09.610 --> 13:11.260
<i>The age of twenty.</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:16.180
<i>That was when Ah Yeong fell in love for the first time.</i>

13:16.180 --> 13:18.940
<i>- Oppa! <br> - Ah Yeong!</i>

13:19.370 --> 13:21.370
<i> - What should we eat? <br> - Tteokbokki? (T/N: spicy rice cakes)</i>

13:21.370 --> 13:25.930
<i>- And soondae (T/N blood sausage). <br> - And fried food.</i>

13:28.870 --> 13:31.180
<i>It's really delicious!</i>

13:31.180 --> 13:33.470
<i>They were always together,</i>

13:33.470 --> 13:36.940
<i>and Ah Yeong was happy every moment they were together.</i>

13:40.180 --> 13:43.240
<i>She thought their love would last forever.</i>

13:45.350 --> 13:47.740
<i>Sweetie!</i>

13:47.740 --> 13:50.510
<i> I missed you! </i>

13:50.510 --> 13:51.710
<i> You waited for a long time, right?</i>

13:51.710 --> 13:57.720
<i>But Ah Yeong's forever ended in just ten seconds.</i>

13:58.710 --> 14:02.050
<i>- Let's go eat something tasty. <br> - Something tasty?</i>

14:04.120 --> 14:07.620
<i>Her first love, with whom she'd ended things,</i>

14:11.910 --> 14:14.410
<i>I'm back.</i>

14:14.410 --> 14:17.490
<i>appeared in front of her again.</i>

14:30.870 --> 14:34.170
Here she is.

14:34.170 --> 14:38.940
I thought you'd be crying your heart out.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.230
What's all this?

14:41.230 --> 14:44.280
- You're a little late. <br> - Someone might think you asked us to come.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.810
Do you know how hard it was for us to find you here?

14:45.810 --> 14:47.980
We've been friends since high school.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.910
When a friend is feeling depressed,

14:49.910 --> 14:52.390
shouldn't you know where she is?

14:52.390 --> 14:58.410
For feeling depressed, isn't this a bit much?

15:01.760 --> 15:04.460
What happened?

15:04.460 --> 15:07.520
- What? <br> - I'm talking about that bastard, Kim Byeong Ho.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.180
You guys met him too?

15:16.220 --> 15:18.160
- He's still there? <br> - Hey.

15:18.160 --> 15:22.160
Ran Ju hit a person after a long time today. I was so surprised.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.490
Is he alive?

15:25.160 --> 15:26.950
Hey, tell us.

15:26.950 --> 15:29.860
What did he say to you?

15:32.370 --> 15:35.640
<i>Let's start again.</i>

15:37.250 --> 15:39.780
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15:39.780 --> 15:42.960
<i>But no matter how much I think about it...</i>

15:42.960 --> 15:45.330
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

15:51.240 --> 15:53.230
<i>Ah Yeong.</i>

15:53.230 --> 15:55.300
<i>Don't follow me.</i>

16:10.730 --> 16:13.730
He's marrying someone else.

16:14.940 --> 16:18.310
- No way. <br> - No way. That crazy bastard.

16:18.310 --> 16:22.210
Wait. Is that why he came back?

16:23.270 --> 16:26.160
Let's go. Hey, hurry and get up. Get up.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.310
- Where are we going all of a sudden? <br> - To kill that crazy bastard.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.050
Then someone is really going to die.

16:30.050 --> 16:32.350
I already feel like killing him.

16:32.350 --> 16:34.800
Here, here.

16:36.740 --> 16:41.160
I think I've lived like a complete idiot all this time.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.260
- I'm not going to live like that anymore. <br> - What's with her?

16:44.260 --> 16:50.030
- I don't know. Let's just sit down and listen. <br> - Go ahead.

16:50.030 --> 16:52.970
I've been living dragging my past around,

16:52.970 --> 16:56.260
but that ends today. The end!

16:56.260 --> 17:00.440
I'm going to become a bitch now.

17:00.440 --> 17:04.030
I'm going to be a

17:04.030 --> 17:06.839
total bitch.

17:09.220 --> 17:13.849
What do you say? Want to join me?

17:13.849 --> 17:16.339
What's this, a proposal or something?

17:16.339 --> 17:21.560
Hey, well, wouldn't you say Lee Ran Ju is already a complete bitch?

17:21.560 --> 17:23.450
There's no end to becoming a bitch.

17:23.450 --> 17:26.980
- One can always upgrade. <br> - Oh.

17:29.830 --> 17:32.830
Won't you join me?

17:32.830 --> 17:37.690
If that's the case then...I should accept this proposal.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.540
Ah, you're both crazy.

17:39.540 --> 17:43.140
- Hey, get up, will you? <br> - No, no, no, boy I'm so tired, oh!

17:43.140 --> 17:45.270
Oh, I see, you're the only sane one here.

17:45.270 --> 17:48.880
- Get up. <br> - But still, "bitch" is too much.

17:50.940 --> 17:55.860
- Bitches! <br> - Yes! <br> - Yes!

18:34.560 --> 18:37.300
<i>If the woman keeps doing that, then the man gets confused.</i>

18:37.300 --> 18:39.460
<i>It makes him want to get confirmation.</i>

18:41.350 --> 18:44.630
<i>I'm saying you shouldn't confuse your boyfriend.</i>

18:46.850 --> 18:50.890
<i>Ah, your boyfriend must not like this.</i>

18:52.880 --> 19:00.830

19:10.790 --> 19:12.840
<i>Yes, Writer Seo?</i>

19:14.760 --> 19:16.400
I don't have one.

19:17.180 --> 19:18.890
What?

19:18.890 --> 19:20.760
A boyfriend.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.780
A boyfriend who gets anxious and tells me when he doesn't like something...

19:29.360 --> 19:30.990
I don't have one.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.640
♫ <i>I don't know when it started</i> ♫

19:39.640 --> 19:45.640

19:52.520 --> 19:54.050
<i>How about a kiss right there?</i>

19:54.050 --> 19:56.980
<i>- What? <br> - I'll take you to a good place.</i>

19:56.980 --> 20:00.680
<i>Then today's the last day I'll be coming here.</i>

20:00.680 --> 20:03.980
<i>You know what? You look really pretty today.</i>

20:03.980 --> 20:09.390

20:09.390 --> 20:13.950
