00:33.440 --> 00:35.870

00:36.690 --> 00:38.960
<i>You're nice but...</i>

00:43.230 --> 00:48.660

00:49.260 --> 00:51.080

I'm busy with work right now. I'll call you back later.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.130
Do you not like this place?

01:55.780 --> 01:58.540
It's not too bad.

01:58.540 --> 02:01.320
Then shall we go to the "not too bad" place?

02:18.630 --> 02:20.850
So how was the movie?

02:22.440 --> 02:24.040
It was so-so.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.890
Wasn't the main lead pretty cool?

02:28.890 --> 02:32.110
Well... he was fine.

02:33.410 --> 02:35.440
How do you like this place?

02:40.470 --> 02:44.260
- Well... it's not bad. <br> - "It's not bad."

02:47.980 --> 02:50.980
You shouldn't be that obvious. You're not very conspicuous.

02:50.980 --> 02:53.000
It's really not bad.

02:54.540 --> 02:58.110
I like it... you.

02:58.110 --> 03:03.320
<i>And today, on Seo Ji Won's scale,</i>

03:03.320 --> 03:06.040

03:06.040 --> 03:08.300
Oh my god, seriously, Lee Seung Yu!

03:08.300 --> 03:11.200
Why did you change so much?

03:11.200 --> 03:16.180
<i>Episode 7: Brilliantly Shattered</i> <br> I need to sew this up. I'm speechless.

03:20.210 --> 03:23.940
Maybe it was when I was in high school. After Ran Ju had transferred to our school.

03:23.940 --> 03:27.240
- So you've been close with Ji Won since then? <br> - Yeah.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.890
Our personalities were bad, so we never got along with other kids.

03:30.890 --> 03:32.950
I thought so.

03:32.950 --> 03:35.500
You don't need to be so sure of it.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.890
Without even realizing it, the truth just came out.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.530
Ran Ju is like family to us.

03:43.530 --> 03:46.570
You know what happens if you mess with my family, right?

03:46.570 --> 03:48.520
So if you just want to play around with Ran Ju,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.640
then put your feelings away sooner rather than later.

03:51.510 --> 03:53.380
But I do want to play with her.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.200
I also want to get to know her and see her.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.880
I want to do everything with her.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.370
I don't just think of her sometimes. I think of her every day.

04:05.630 --> 04:08.940
Are you confident those feelings of yours won't change?

04:08.940 --> 04:13.850
Oh? Does that mean you'll consider me family too?

04:13.850 --> 04:16.420
I shouldn't have given him an opening.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.170
He takes it too far. Too far.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.339
Oh my god! You scared me!

04:23.370 --> 04:28.230
Here's my order: 18 shots of espresso all in one cup.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.470
Hey!

04:32.670 --> 04:36.010
I'll give you credit.

04:43.340 --> 04:47.450
What's wrong? Did something happen again?

04:47.450 --> 04:49.810
Let me ask you something.

04:49.810 --> 04:53.870
Sure, ask me anything. I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

04:53.870 --> 05:00.050
Byeong Ho... when you found out that he cheated on you,

05:01.370 --> 05:03.450
how come you didn't ask him anything?

05:03.450 --> 05:05.710
Your question is a bit too strong.

05:05.710 --> 05:10.630
I'll forgive you for running off with my report when we were 24.

05:16.380 --> 05:20.100
Because I saw it with my own two eyes.

05:21.010 --> 05:23.450
But still Oppa Byeong Ho—

05:23.450 --> 05:26.710
You could have heard out what that bastard had to say.

05:29.090 --> 05:32.180
His eyes were quivering.

05:32.180 --> 05:36.500
I knew what those quivering eyes meant.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.320
It meant he was lying to me.

05:42.850 --> 05:46.770
Even if I had held on to Kim Byeong Ho then,

05:46.770 --> 05:49.410
he might not have come back to me.

05:50.390 --> 05:53.610
We were already like broken glass at that point.

05:57.070 --> 06:00.170
But why are you asking about that? Why?

06:00.170 --> 06:02.170
Is your relationship not going well?

06:05.010 --> 06:07.210
My series isn't going well.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.280
Good luck!

06:32.970 --> 06:35.080
Noona, I'll be back in an hour.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.870
Where are you going now? Hey!

06:38.870 --> 06:41.770
Oh my! It looks delicious.

06:41.770 --> 06:46.110
Where did all this come from? It looks really good.

06:46.110 --> 06:48.910
- What's all this? <br> - Your fan club sent it.

06:48.910 --> 06:51.410
- Fan club? <br> - Here's a card!

06:51.410 --> 06:54.300
"You're always hungry, right?"

06:54.300 --> 06:56.510
That's not true. I'm not hungry.

06:56.510 --> 07:00.680
<i>You're always hungry, right? Because there's no one above you.</i>

07:00.680 --> 07:03.300
<i>Announcer Lee Ran Ju with the honey-like voice, fighting!</i>

07:03.300 --> 07:06.610
What's the occasion? Don't only idols get service like this?

07:06.610 --> 07:09.980
- Oh my goodness! <br> - Everyone enjoy. I'll be right back.

07:09.980 --> 07:11.940
We'll enjoy them!

07:15.950 --> 07:19.280
Hyeong Jun Yeong! I got you!

07:19.280 --> 07:22.050
- Why are you so fast? <br> - What's all of that?

07:22.050 --> 07:25.320
- I just delivered some lunches. <br> - What are you up to?

07:25.320 --> 07:29.110
- Nothing, it's just an event. <br>- Why are you showing up here all of a sudden?

07:29.110 --> 07:31.230
Is it okay for me to say it here?

07:34.490 --> 07:37.090
Really?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.720
You can't. Just go.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.120
- Just go quickly. <br> - Come on. I want to tell you though.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.370

08:13.610 --> 08:16.390

08:20.050 --> 08:21.480

08:21.480 --> 08:25.980
I suggested marketing it along with the movie, and it all worked out.

08:25.980 --> 08:29.490
You and Writer Seo must be fated.

08:29.490 --> 08:32.789

08:35.429 --> 08:38.620
Are you going to tell Writer Seo about it right away?

08:39.740 --> 08:41.549
I'm not sure.

08:41.549 --> 08:44.260
No way... are you going to surprise her?

My friend wasn't always this harsh.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.160
She's doing that on purpose.

10:32.310 --> 10:34.250

11:24.300 --> 11:26.040
how about we go straight forward?

I heard that you will stop working anyway.
