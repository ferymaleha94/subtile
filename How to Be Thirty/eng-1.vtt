Why?

00:35.700 --> 00:39.530
Ah, Assistant Manager Yoon, this is the final episode. The final episode!
 <i>For the price of "immortality, "forever love"</i>

00:39.530 --> 00:41.300
<i>It's too cruel.</i> 
 <i>[Mina's one and only goal is "revenge"!]</i>

00:41.300 --> 00:44.470
<i>Blood, lots of blood!
 [Let's meet the deadline!!]</i>

00:44.470 --> 00:47.290
<i>This is definitely horror.</i>

00:47.290 --> 00:52.960
He's a male lead who has been meeting other girls and deceiving the female lead.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.840
There should be the choice of getting revenge on the male lead after learning the truth.

00:56.840 --> 01:02.440
It should be killing him the moment they promise eternal love at their wedding.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.700
There isn't any other option.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.670
<i>This isn't "psycho bride," appropriate for 19 and older.</i>

01:07.670 --> 01:09.530
<i>You shouldn't do that.</i>

01:17.500 --> 01:21.360
But still, this is the climax! How can you change this?

01:21.360 --> 01:26.730
<i>Miss Writer, who goes crazy over love and does all that for a revenge nowadays?</i>

01:26.730 --> 01:30.800
We should let them go coolly. Why should we go so far as to kill them?

01:30.800 --> 01:35.450
You should kill. You should kill so that this damned love becomes complete.

01:35.450 --> 01:37.680
It's too old.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.780
<i>Youngsters aren't like that nowadays. They are very cool.</i>

01:40.780 --> 01:43.180
Maybe you don't know because you're thirty.

01:43.180 --> 01:46.950
<i>Because you're thirty. Because you're thirty.</i>

01:46.950 --> 01:50.540
Thirty? 
 <i> - Nowadays they try...</i>

01:50.540 --> 01:52.680
Old?

01:52.680 --> 01:58.110
You don't know that style, right? You should have an open mind.

01:58.110 --> 02:03.120
Who? Who said that thirty is old?

02:10.200 --> 02:15.030
As expected!

02:19.070 --> 02:24.950
Now it's bye to my twenties too.

02:24.950 --> 02:26.970
Here.

02:26.970 --> 02:29.970
So? It's a novel nonsense.

02:29.970 --> 02:32.860
It's fun. That thirty is old.

Hello. I am a new announcer, Lee Yun Sang, from the 35th class of announcers.

02:41.180 --> 02:43.180
I am his colleague, Kim Do Hui.

02:43.180 --> 02:45.640

02:52.580 --> 02:54.480
Do a good job.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.990
It must be nice.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.200
I prepared for my exams watching Announcer Lee Ran Ju.

03:03.200 --> 03:08.020
Her force is no joke. She's even cooler in person than on air.

03:09.810 --> 03:16.140
Ah! I can't wear heels anymore.

03:16.140 --> 03:18.440
I am going to ruin my ankles, seriously!

03:21.720 --> 03:24.450

03:32.210 --> 03:37.150
Okay! I'll change everything then.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.950
Really?

03:39.950 --> 03:42.840
Instead,

03:42.840 --> 03:46.090
- I will have to stop writing for a while.
 <i>- Ah, seriously!</i>

03:46.090 --> 03:50.760
No, you can't! Who stops writing with only one final episode left to complete?!

03:50.760 --> 03:52.340
We'll be in big trouble!

03:52.340 --> 03:55.740
Then leave it just like this! I don't know!

03:55.740 --> 03:58.870
Uh, I have a stiff neck!

03:58.870 --> 04:01.340
<i>Oh no! Writer, you're acting. You're acting?!</i>

04:01.340 --> 04:04.110
<i>- You are acting. Your acting skill has improved lately.</i> 
 - Assistat Manager Yoon! Assistant Manager Yoon, 911!

04:04.110 --> 04:09.110
Ah, Assistant Manager Yoon!
 <i> Thirty, an age everyone will face one day.</i>

04:09.110 --> 04:13.590
Assistant Manager Yoon! 
 <i>Still clumsy and strange,</i>

04:13.590 --> 04:17.420
<i>we are thirty. 
 Episode 1: How to be Thirty</i>

04:20.740 --> 04:25.640
- Congrats on meeting your deadline.
- It's not something to congratulate.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.890
You want to say that you will have a new manager, right?

04:27.890 --> 04:29.770
It was my last request.

04:29.770 --> 04:34.180
But you saw the reaction, right? Everyone is going nuts about how refreshingly satisfying it is.

04:34.180 --> 04:36.330
Writer!

04:37.340 --> 04:40.170
Ah, I heard that you had a hard time because of the demonstration.

04:40.170 --> 04:42.110
Sorry.

04:42.110 --> 04:46.090
Even just thinking about it...

04:46.090 --> 04:50.560
I'm saying this because I care for you, Writer.

04:50.560 --> 04:55.380
You really shouldn't be like that to other managers!

<i>It's entry number 3006. Ah, really?!</i>

05:31.290 --> 05:36.080
<i>Yes, it's that one. Thank you. Thank you so much!</i>

05:39.630 --> 05:41.350
Writer?

05:44.780 --> 05:47.650
Did you remember the old days?

05:47.650 --> 05:49.900
No, I was just...

05:49.900 --> 05:53.940
Miss Writer, you know the proposal you sent me last time?

05:55.360 --> 05:57.080
What proposal?

05:57.080 --> 06:00.980
You know, the romance comic about reuniting with the first love.

06:01.950 --> 06:06.140
- Ah! What about it? 
 - It was approved.

06:06.140 --> 06:09.630
He said it's perfect for the new project he is about to launch.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.260
He said to start the serial right away.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.340
That?

06:22.040 --> 06:25.510
Why choose this out of everything?

06:26.050 --> 06:27.130
<i>Like a Watercolor</i>

06:34.120 --> 06:39.170
Oh! Look at these dialogues. What should I do now?

06:39.170 --> 06:42.760
I wrote these? No way!

06:42.760 --> 06:45.500
I didn't, right?

06:45.500 --> 06:51.130
Why would they approve this? Why?

06:54.100 --> 06:55.920
"Don't like me."

06:55.920 --> 07:00.710
Ugh!!

07:00.710 --> 07:02.410
"What is that?"

07:02.410 --> 07:05.230
"Don't like me."

07:05.230 --> 07:07.370
"How exactly do you do that?"

07:07.370 --> 07:11.570
Oh my, what do I do? Ew!

07:11.570 --> 07:13.270
Writer.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.530
- You're here. 
 - Yes.

07:20.530 --> 07:23.640
Why are you alone?

07:26.010 --> 07:31.630
What a shame! You made an effort coming here to meet the new manager, but he can't be here because something came up.

07:31.630 --> 07:34.440
Oh is that it?

07:34.440 --> 07:36.660
It can't be helped.

07:36.660 --> 07:39.280
Writer! Do you know that?

07:39.280 --> 07:43.430
The new manager is totally sold on your new proposal.

07:43.430 --> 07:47.970
Our CEO put in real effort to recruit him.

07:47.970 --> 07:50.430
This proposal...

07:50.430 --> 07:52.420
Assistant Manager Yoon, I thought about it carefully.

07:52.420 --> 07:56.110
How about we do something else other than this? I can'tâ€”

07:56.110 --> 07:57.720
Sorry.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.110
Hello.

08:04.110 --> 08:07.860
I really don't have the confidence to do the next project.

08:07.860 --> 08:10.400
Ah, Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.970
<i>Yes. Assistant Manager Yoon, did you eat?</i>

08:12.970 --> 08:16.910
<i>I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be there, but I couldn't go.</i>

08:18.570 --> 08:21.490
Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu?

08:25.500 --> 08:29.290
It couldn't possibly be that Lee Seung Yu, right?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.610
No.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.610
It's not possible.

08:34.610 --> 08:37.800
There are so many people with the same name in this world.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.350
Seo Ji Won.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.050
Let's go together.

08:57.740 --> 09:00.240
<i>Da capo</i>

09:21.720 --> 09:23.270
Are you okay?

09:46.070 --> 09:51.580
You heard the name Lee Seung Yu once and let your imagination run wild?

09:51.580 --> 09:54.810
If it's to that extent, then it's your fantasy, my friend.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.930
Hey! What do you mean by fantasy?

09:56.930 --> 10:02.170
I mean, does it even make sense that you'd meet your first love again as your manager?

10:02.170 --> 10:04.960
Those kinds of coincidences only happen in dramas.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.510
But do you guys know that

10:07.510 --> 10:10.960
dramas don't lie?

10:10.960 --> 10:16.080
Oh my, then were you expecting to be able to work and have a romance too? Like buy one get one free deal?

10:16.080 --> 10:20.120
- Oh, our Writer Seo is ambitious.
 - I was just imagining, that's all.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.010
Saying "I like you" to each other in high school...

10:24.010 --> 10:25.650
is something like that considered love?

10:25.650 --> 10:30.410
Everyone, there is no love in this world even when you share yourself emotionally and physically with someone.

10:30.410 --> 10:33.290
That's why... it's a romance comic.

10:33.290 --> 10:35.910
- Exactly. 
 - We're thirty now.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.600
Don't you think that we need at least "29"?
 (T/N: Korean adult books/videos are rated "19")

10:38.600 --> 10:43.040
I don't understand how she actually became an announcer. Her words are way too harsh.

10:43.040 --> 10:47.640
Don't be too hard on her. She is doing only one radio program.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.800
How can an announcer have a phobia of cameras?

10:49.800 --> 10:53.500
Hey! You're the really pitiful one.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.170
The guy you dated for two years cheated on you with a girl he went out with for just three months.

10:57.170 --> 11:03.200
Yes, he really was a bastard, to whom Hong Ah Yeong gave up her twenties.

11:03.200 --> 11:08.500
That's enough. Is there anyone here who feels free when it comes to men?

11:09.660 --> 11:11.010
Specialize in scumbags.

11:11.010 --> 11:15.700
<i>- I missed you! 
 - You waited for a long time, right?</i>

11:18.140 --> 11:20.490
Specialize in bastards.

11:20.490 --> 11:23.450
<i>You're like a puppy.</i>

11:23.450 --> 11:25.790
He was a real bastard!

11:25.790 --> 11:29.500
And... trash.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.670
Me?

11:30.670 --> 11:35.650
Why? The guys I met were pretty decent.

11:35.650 --> 11:38.600
No, not the men,

11:38.600 --> 11:40.810
- I'm talking about you. 
 - Hey!

11:40.810 --> 11:44.800
<i>Please go out with me.</i>

11:44.800 --> 11:48.790
<i>So annoying.</i> 
 I agree.

11:48.790 --> 11:52.460
- I agree. 
 - As for me, I'm sick of men now.

11:52.460 --> 11:55.140
Then why are you dreaming of meeting your first love again?

11:55.140 --> 11:57.240
I just imagined it, okay?

11:57.240 --> 12:02.520
Ah, I don't need anything! I will make this cafe a success and season two of my life!

12:02.520 --> 12:03.710
I will make a colorful leap!

12:03.710 --> 12:07.750
Oh, our President Hong, you are something else.

12:07.750 --> 12:12.930
Then, in season two of my life, I should just experience an awesome love with an awesome guy.

12:12.930 --> 12:16.570
Then, what could be our Writer Seo's goal?

12:16.570 --> 12:20.070
Goal? Well...

12:21.350 --> 12:27.750
Well, you know me. I'm a well-known writer who works on one webtoon after another.

12:27.750 --> 12:31.020
Would there be a need for a goal?

12:31.020 --> 12:34.680
- You'll have to stop me, or I'll really end up killing her today.
 - Don't come near.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.800
You'll just have to hit rock bottom to come to your senses.

12:37.800 --> 12:42.110
If that's case then,

12:42.110 --> 12:46.280
I do have a definite goal.

12:48.050 --> 12:50.810
So, are you in?

Now that we've completed face-to-face introduction, shall we go have a company dinner?

17:09.990 --> 17:11.650
Let's go.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.100
Can you hold your liquor?

17:19.100 --> 17:22.430
- Yeah, I guess.
 - Entrance exam...

17:22.430 --> 17:25.310
I was gone just for a short while since she will be starting in a few days.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.600

17:28.600 --> 17:34.200

 - Congratulations!

Wow, it's really nice.

Everyone is going to drink till the end, right?

17:55.210 --> 17:58.100
- Sure, we should drink.
 - Ah, I am going to have to take care of everyone again.

17:58.100 --> 18:01.510

18:01.510 --> 18:03.680
Then why would someone like that...

<i>Or maybe he isn't?</i>

18:05.380 --> 18:09.140
- Always the last one.
 - Ah, you must be the type to just talk.

18:09.140 --> 18:13.600
<i>Right, there's no way something that happens only in dramas is going to happen in real life.</i>

18:13.600 --> 18:16.710
<i>No.</i>

18:16.710 --> 18:19.530
<i>Have I changed too much?</i>

18:19.530 --> 18:23.170
- I couldn't have gotten into a big trouble. 
 - Ah, you shouldn't touch the family.

18:23.170 --> 18:27.820
The CEO put in a real effort...

18:27.820 --> 18:31.090
<i>What the heck was I imagining yesterday?</i>

18:31.090 --> 18:34.000
<i>Look at how pathetic you are, Seo Ji Won.</i>

18:34.000 --> 18:38.430
- Goppa, he's Goppa! (T/N: thankful oppa) 
 - Ah, everyone is going to misunderstand.

18:45.570 --> 18:49.750
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

18:52.440 --> 18:53.920
Seo Ji Won.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.250
Assistant Manager Lee.

19:02.250 --> 19:05.690
I've missed you, Seo Ji Won.

19:05.690 --> 19:11.650
â™« <i> Before I can notice, you came into my heart </i> â™«

19:11.650 --> 19:18.170
â™« <i> You became the shade and a place to rest </i> â™«

19:18.170 --> 19:24.580
â™« <i> Ah ah~ After I met you, my day is </i> â™«

19:24.580 --> 19:28.970
â™« <i> completely filled with you </i> â™«

19:28.970 --> 19:35.140
â™« <i> As if even fear is nothing at all </i> â™«

19:35.140 --> 19:38.200
â™« <i>You made it that way</i> â™«

19:38.200 --> 19:42.500
â™« <i>You are the only one who knows all my secrets</i> â™«

19:42.500 --> 19:46.610
â™« <i>You are my biggest gift</i> â™«

19:46.610 --> 19:49.820
<i>How To Be Thirty</i>

19:49.820 --> 19:52.580
<i>Who would've thought that I'd meet you again as my manager?</i>

19:52.580 --> 19:55.660
<i>I applied for the position. And "Like a Watercolor" is our story, isn't it?</i>

19:55.660 --> 19:59.460
<i>That... it's a romance story, but sometimes it seems like a thriller.</i>

19:59.460 --> 20:02.630
<i> - Especially that male lead character. 
 - Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu, why did you suddenly...</i>

20:02.630 --> 20:04.930
<i>Tell me the profile of the guy I am going on a blind date with this time.</i>

20:04.930 --> 20:06.940
<i>He is a 35-year-old lawyer.</i>

20:06.940 --> 20:08.320
<i>Why are you cleaning out someone so young?</i>

20:08.320 --> 20:10.130
<i>He looks young to you as well, right?</i>

20:10.130 --> 20:12.340
<i>She's going to cause trouble, trouble.</i>

20:12.340 --> 20:14.760
<i>You are totally the embodiment of a kid.</i>

20:14.760 --> 20:18.830
<i>It's great to see you again.</i>
