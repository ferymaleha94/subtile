I don't have one.

00:57.350 --> 00:58.410
What?

00:58.410 --> 01:00.290
A boyfriend.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.120
What does that mean?

01:03.120 --> 01:07.420
A boyfriend who gets anxious and tells me when he doesn't like something...

01:08.480 --> 01:10.050
I don't have one.

01:13.890 --> 01:18.970
What's this? Why aren't you saying anything?

01:18.970 --> 01:22.470
Writer Seo, well actually...

01:22.470 --> 01:24.470
Why have you been calling me Writer Seo this entire time?

01:24.470 --> 01:26.990
You see, my phone is on speaker mode right now.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.150
So I'll call you again—

01:34.150 --> 01:38.280
<i>Oh my, Assistant Manager Lee! I must've dialed the wrong number!</i>

01:38.280 --> 01:41.390
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

01:50.040 --> 01:53.390
Seo Ji Won, I can't believe you just did that.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.210
I should just die.

02:01.210 --> 02:03.350
I should just die.

<i>I've got something to say.</i>

02:27.030 --> 02:29.680
<i>My phone is on speaker mode right now.</i>

02:54.840 --> 02:58.410
Ji Won, why haven't you died yet?

02:58.410 --> 03:01.370
Isn't it about time for you to die?

03:07.620 --> 03:10.980
Alcohol. Alcohol is the only thing that can rescue me from this world.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.980
And the best alcohol is...

03:15.900 --> 03:17.930
beer.

03:24.850 --> 03:27.200
Now, I think I can live.

03:34.490 --> 03:39.310
Drinking beer at the laundromat... I never would've thought of that.

03:39.310 --> 03:41.760
Director Cha Do Hoon?

03:55.270 --> 03:57.590
Do you live around here?

03:57.590 --> 03:59.120
I don't.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.550
Ah, I see.

04:05.550 --> 04:07.820
How about having a kiss right there?

04:07.820 --> 04:10.150
Pardon?

04:10.150 --> 04:12.650
I'm talking about the main character's first kiss.

04:12.650 --> 04:15.180
I think this place has a similar vibe to the webtoon.

04:16.149 --> 04:18.570
Oh.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.560
Wait a minute.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.220
Are you talking about "Psycho Bride" right now?

04:26.220 --> 04:27.780
Yes.

04:29.180 --> 04:32.400
The project hasn't even been approved yet.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.210
- You're not going to shoot it? <br> - Of course I am.

04:37.910 --> 04:42.180
You should look for another place for the kiss scene.

04:42.180 --> 04:46.020
How does it look similar? It doesn't look anything like the webtoon.

05:01.480 --> 05:06.450
Did he come here for research?

05:15.260 --> 05:17.210
We were all so young.

It looks like a completely different place now.

06:03.680 --> 06:08.120
What's this? Can he see me right now?

06:11.960 --> 06:15.180
<i>Yes, okay!</i>

06:21.320 --> 06:24.080
<i>Yes, okay!</i>

Ah, Seo Ji Won, seriously.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.680
She's so cute.

06:32.680 --> 06:39.320
Wait a minute. Does this mean he wants me to go on my own

06:39.320 --> 06:44.150
or is he saying we should go together?

06:46.610 --> 06:50.250
Wait a second, just in case,

06:50.250 --> 06:52.920
should I moisturize my skin?

06:59.150 --> 07:01.250
Oh, so moist.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.280
Now, point your toes.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.500

07:07.500 --> 07:10.330
You can do it; you're just not trying to.

Just a little bit more. You can do it. A little bit more.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.420
- That's good. Keep going! <br> - Teacher!

07:17.420 --> 07:21.290

08:25.510 --> 08:29.760
So how did you know I was going to leave now?

08:29.760 --> 08:33.950
You called the school to ask if there were students on Saturdays.

08:39.789 --> 08:42.580
Wow! How did you do that?

08:43.820 --> 08:46.640
If you do this, then it opens. Do you want to try?

09:50.530 --> 09:55.560

09:55.560 --> 09:57.820
Finding that photo was quite worthwhile.

You know me too well.

12:17.790 --> 12:20.380
I don't know you well so,

12:20.380 --> 12:21.460
aren't you going to quit?

Announcer Lee, don't say such scary things.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.610
It's still the same.

13:06.610 --> 13:09.510
- Can we go in? <br> - Why are you thinking about it? Just go in.

13:09.510 --> 13:11.250
Hey! Can we go in?

13:11.250 --> 13:15.060
You went in, so I can also go in.

14:08.360 --> 14:12.050
No, it isn't complete yet.

Don't look.

14:17.310 --> 14:20.190
You're making me nervous.

14:20.190 --> 14:23.280
I told you not to look.

14:25.820 --> 14:28.690
- Don't look! <br> - I just glanced at it.

14:28.690 --> 14:32.750
If you see it now, you won't be touched.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.820
That's me? You're saying that's me?

14:36.850 --> 14:38.920
You're saying this is me?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.940
Look! We don't look alike at all.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.850
It is Seo Ji Won no matter who looks at it. Look! It's the same.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.210
That's me? Really? Why does it look like this?

14:46.210 --> 14:48.180
Who's there?

14:50.150 --> 14:52.590
Oh my god! What should we do?

14:53.450 --> 14:57.450
Come here. Come here.

15:51.950 --> 15:54.050
The title of the new project.

15:54.950 --> 15:57.490
Why did you name it "Like a Watercolor"?

15:58.340 --> 16:00.850
I'm not sure.

16:00.850 --> 16:04.140
Because the colors blend anywhere?

16:05.070 --> 16:07.890
It's pretty and pleasant.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.210
You're right.

16:11.210 --> 16:13.510
It is pretty and pleasant.

16:14.610 --> 16:18.440
But bad colors that stain things quickly too.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.480
If we make a mistake with watercolors, we cannot reverse it.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.040
We can't even paint more on top.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.290

16:31.980 --> 16:34.490
You're picky. Didn't you know?

Of course. That's why you dumped me.

16:46.420 --> 16:49.560
You're the one who said those words back then.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.890
I was going to say I liked it.

17:37.130 --> 17:41.200
But that girl didn't listen till the end and disappeared.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.770
It's a painful memory for me.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.890
I was hurt.

17:48.970 --> 17:51.700
Why are you laughing?

17:51.700 --> 17:55.300

How can I forget that?

18:05.180 --> 18:07.640
I thought about it

18:10.450 --> 18:14.480
very often, Seo Ji Won.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.830
Do you like me?

18:38.700 --> 18:40.140
Why?

18:41.700 --> 18:44.020
Your gaze...

18:45.370 --> 18:47.050
confuses me.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.660
Did l?

18:57.990 --> 19:00.170
Look at the time!

19:05.910 --> 19:07.920
Let's go, Ji Won.

19:17.350 --> 19:19.000
Lee Seung Yu.

19:30.150 --> 19:32.150
Do you want to sleep with me?

19:34.640 --> 19:38.600
♫ <i> The road only the two of us walked</i> ♫

19:38.600 --> 19:43.350
♫ <i>Is it because it's the first time?</i> ♫

19:43.350 --> 19:48.520
♫ <i>I don't want my shaking heart to be discovered</i> ♫

19:48.520 --> 19:52.860
♫ <i>Only awkward laughs come out</i> ♫

19:52.860 --> 19:55.720
♫ <i>Inside the sky</i> ♫

19:55.720 --> 19:58.140
<i> How To Be Thirty</i>

19:58.140 --> 20:00.960
<i>Not everybody takes responsibility for romantic words.</i>

20:00.960 --> 20:02.670
<i>Indeed, he's different.</i>

20:02.670 --> 20:04.540
<i>Are you dating someone, Seo Ji Won?</i>

20:04.540 --> 20:06.550
<i>Hey! Who are you dating?</i>

20:06.550 --> 20:08.350
<i>l missed you.</i>

20:10.220 --> 20:13.540
<i>- Don't do that! <br> - Seo Ji Won, you sure are bold.</i>

20:13.540 --> 20:15.920
<i> I thought you wouldn't love anyone again. </i>

20:15.920 --> 20:19.300
<i>It's strange even to me. Why am I like this?</i>

20:19.300 --> 20:20.720
<i> Oppa, I missed you!</i>

20:20.720 --> 20:25.240
<i>But Ji Won, he isn't someone who would hurt you, right?</i>

20:25.240 --> 20:28.150
♫ <i>My heart leaves </i> ♫
