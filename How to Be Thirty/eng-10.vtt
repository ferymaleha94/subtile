02:41.910 --> 02:44.740
I have to do some work.

04:14.030 --> 04:18.230
Capture. Tap, tap!

04:18.940 --> 04:23.600
Instead of obstinately holding out, you should tap out if you can't go on.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.570
- I wasn't obstinately holding out. I definitely could have won that! <br> - Ah, seriously.

04:27.570 --> 04:30.840
Let's go again. I'll attack.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.370
You've never asked about me.

04:58.470 --> 05:01.430
I want to get to know everything about you.

05:01.430 --> 05:06.490
I'm curious about what kind of a person you are, Miss Ran Ju.

05:06.490 --> 05:08.910
But I'm not curious at all.

05:08.910 --> 05:10.400
Are you that scared?

05:10.400 --> 05:13.840
- Of what? <br> - Falling for me.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.590
- You're being ridiculous. <br> - Now you seem like a scaredy-cat.

05:16.590 --> 05:19.360
- What? <br> - You only pretend to be strong.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.250
I'm speechless.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.950
Miss Ran Ju, give me your hand.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.590
Why?

05:34.640 --> 05:36.900
Tell me everything you're afraid of.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.780
If you can tap out well, you'll be able to get back up on your feet,

05:39.780 --> 05:42.470
and start over again.

05:46.660 --> 05:51.950
So why don't you just surrender and confess already? That you love me.

05:51.950 --> 05:55.450
Forget it. That's not going to happen.

Looks like you're working quite hard, seeing that you're coming here at this hour.

07:14.220 --> 07:17.850
- Do you live around here? <br> - Sorry?

07:17.850 --> 07:22.250
- Last time you definitely said... <br> - I didn't tell you that we lived in the same neighborhood because I was afraid it'd become awkward between us.

07:22.250 --> 07:26.320
But now that we keep running into each other, I don't have any other choice.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.620
I see. You're someone who doesn't like to mix work with personal life.

07:30.620 --> 07:35.860
I hate mixing personal feelings with work. Be it dating or anything else.

07:40.770 --> 07:42.660

07:47.480 --> 07:50.560
I wanted to separate the writer from the work,

07:50.560 --> 07:54.020
but seeing you right now, I don't think I can do that.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.750
- Pardon? <br> - You like thrilling things.

07:57.750 --> 08:01.350
Doesn't it bother you? Or do you enjoy it?

08:01.350 --> 08:05.350
Ah, the writer and the work, both are strong.

08:05.350 --> 08:08.830
I'm not sure what tone I should go ahead with.

08:11.140 --> 08:13.130
Director Cha Do Hoon.

08:20.810 --> 08:22.720
Let me ask you one thing.

08:23.750 --> 08:29.980
While working on this project, have I wronged you in some way?

08:29.980 --> 08:33.510
Or have I made a mistake?

08:34.960 --> 08:38.049
- Well, I didn't mean it like that... <br> - Yes.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.559
I'm dating Assistant Manager Lee Seung Yu.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.250
But is that something I should be sorry about and apologize for?

08:45.840 --> 08:53.670
Rather than analyzing my private life, you should analyze "Psycho Bride" instead, Director Cha Do Hoon.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.320
Because that's the director's job.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.200
Seo Ji Won! When are you going to become an adult?

09:13.200 --> 09:16.630
Ah, why'd you get mad at him? What's going to come out of being rude to him?

09:16.630 --> 09:19.840
What should I do know? Calm down.

09:26.420 --> 09:28.190
What are you doing?

09:29.490 --> 09:34.870
You kept mumbling to yourself. You seemed like a crazy person.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.610
Are you challenging me to a fight right now?

09:37.610 --> 09:40.900
Fine. I can fight much better than you'd think.

09:40.900 --> 09:45.810
So you're the type of person that can't think of anything else when you're mad.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.730
Here.

09:48.740 --> 09:51.590
Ah! Why is this...

09:56.180 --> 10:01.680
See? You're analyzing me even now. I told you not to do that, right?

10:04.360 --> 10:07.690
I'm sorry. If I were to give you an excuse,

10:07.690 --> 10:11.040
I'd say that since it's a story that you've written, if I got to know you,

10:11.040 --> 10:14.710
I'd be able to understand the story much better...

10:14.710 --> 10:21.410
Then did you think that, like the main lead, I'm someone capable of murder?

10:21.410 --> 10:24.200
You're a creator too and you still don't understand?

10:25.770 --> 10:27.530
To be honest,

10:30.790 --> 10:34.060
there's someone I really hate as well.

10:35.110 --> 10:38.950
But I still miss that person.

10:38.950 --> 10:43.210
I thought you felt the same way I did, so that's why I was like that.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.550
Gosh, I'm telling you all sorts of stuff.

10:50.550 --> 10:54.640
Anyhow, whatever the excuse may be...

10:54.640 --> 10:57.140
I'm sorry.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.860
It's okay.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.620
Then let's work comfortably again.

11:03.620 --> 11:08.050
Well, I don't think we've ever been comfortable with each other.

11:08.050 --> 11:10.630
Then I'll take that as you accepting my apology.

11:10.630 --> 11:13.590
I'll go now. Have a good night.
