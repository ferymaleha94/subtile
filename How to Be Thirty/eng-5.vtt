04:03.380 --> 04:06.280
-Aren't you tired?<br>-Hm?

04:06.280 --> 04:08.710
You were tossing and turning last night.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.280
You noticed?

04:10.280 --> 04:13.200
I guess you're the type who can't sleep if there's someone next to you.

04:13.980 --> 04:18.160
Were you not able to sleep because of me?

04:18.160 --> 04:23.010
Nope. It was because I was too excited.

04:26.750 --> 04:32.640
Not everybody takes responsibility for romantic words. Indeed, you're different.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.710
I see, this is how you're going to be.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.020
I got it.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.140
What about it?

04:44.180 --> 04:46.120
"Your gaze right now... "

04:46.120 --> 04:47.680
Don't say that!

04:49.050 --> 04:49.970
"Do you want to..."

04:49.970 --> 04:51.870
Don't! Don't! Don't!

04:51.870 --> 04:53.600
-Don't say that.<br>-But why?

04:53.600 --> 04:56.140
Don't bring that up again! Stop, stop stop!

-Just drive!<br>- "Do you want to..."

04:58.580 --> 05:01.840
Don't bring that up ever again, okay? Just don't.

05:01.840 --> 05:06.770
Boss Hong! Give me one refreshing ice Americano, please!

05:06.770 --> 05:08.980
Yes, coming up!

05:08.980 --> 05:13.750
Here's your refreshing Americano.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.010
I've really been wanting to drink this.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.320
What's with you?

05:17.320 --> 05:19.340
Why are you in such a good mood? You are scaring me.

05:19.340 --> 05:21.540
Hey, what's so scary about it?

05:21.540 --> 05:26.740
You make a fuss even when your friend is in a good mood.

05:26.740 --> 05:32.110
Is it possible that... the reason why I couldn't get hold of you for last few days is...

"Psycho Bride" is now being adapted into a movie.

05:59.340 --> 06:00.950
Congrats, Writer Seo!

06:00.950 --> 06:05.810
-Then we can't just pass up this occasion. We should have a celebratory party. I'll call Lee Ran Ju.<br>-Nice! Call her.

06:05.810 --> 06:07.360
We are going to have some fun then?

06:07.360 --> 06:09.210
I can't call her though.

06:09.210 --> 06:12.640
-Why?<br>-Lee Ran Ju isn't coming here anymore.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.940
Hello Boss.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.840
-Oh, you're here?<br>-Yes.

06:18.270 --> 06:20.710
Who's this?

06:20.710 --> 06:23.170
The guy Lee Ran Ju met on that blind date.

06:23.170 --> 06:26.220
And also, our new part-timer.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.380
-He's twenty-four.<br>-What?

06:31.380 --> 06:32.880
I've heard about you from the boss.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.330
You're Writer Seo, right?

06:34.330 --> 06:37.340
Ah, yes.

06:37.340 --> 06:38.920
I look forward to your support!

06:38.920 --> 06:43.350
You see, I like Ran Ju a lot. Very, very much.

06:43.350 --> 06:44.160
You saw that?

06:44.160 --> 06:46.590
He says he likes her very, very much.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.150
I see.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.890
Do announcers not take care of themselves?

06:58.890 --> 06:59.940
What is he saying?

06:59.940 --> 07:02.110
Then how is it that you're always wearing the same shirt?

07:02.110 --> 07:05.140
But I'm not. This is a different one.

07:05.140 --> 07:08.950
What's this? Is he watching me from somewhere?

07:11.340 --> 07:13.590
Cutie, beauty, pretty.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.800
Oh my gosh.

07:21.460 --> 07:25.580
So,

07:25.580 --> 07:30.540
the combination of this cheese and sauce is a little,

07:30.540 --> 07:35.070
just a little...actually it's so salty that I can't eat it.

07:35.070 --> 07:38.840
So you're saying it's a lump of salt and so you can't eat it.

07:39.870 --> 07:42.260
The combination really doesn't taste sweet and salty.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.920
It really should have been sweet and salty.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.700
This is just salty. It's too salty.

07:48.700 --> 07:52.520
That's why I think it will go well with this beer.

08:14.270 --> 08:16.940
Oh! This is the taste.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.590
The salty taste of the thick cheese,

08:18.590 --> 08:20.750
is neutralized by the bitter beer.

08:20.750 --> 08:25.430
Is this the taste of appetizer that calls for beer, or beer that calls for an appetizer?

08:25.430 --> 08:27.640
- This is amazing! <br> - Amazing.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.450
That was the perfect sample.

08:30.450 --> 08:34.130
-Did you say your name was Jun Yeong?<br>-Yes.

08:34.130 --> 08:38.919
Take good care of our Ran Ju. I think I can trust her with you.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.809
What are you trusting him with?

08:40.809 --> 08:43.090
Oh, you came.

08:43.090 --> 08:47.790
Announcer Lee, after having said you weren't going to come again, what brings you here?

08:47.790 --> 08:50.370
Should I leave?

08:50.370 --> 08:55.560
Come on! I'm glad you came.

08:58.570 --> 09:01.170
I missed you.

09:04.190 --> 09:06.260
Don't!

09:06.260 --> 09:07.950
It's not like that. Don't!

09:07.950 --> 09:10.550
- Don't do what?!<br>- What are you guys doing embarrassing me?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.580
But I will leave you now.

09:12.580 --> 09:16.340
Have a nice time with your friends.

09:18.260 --> 09:22.370
I think my shift is done, can I leave now?

09:22.370 --> 09:25.700
Of course! Goodbye.

How did you seduce someone so cute, young, kind, and diligent? Tell me!

10:00.800 --> 10:02.190
And what about you?

10:02.190 --> 10:04.230
What do you mean?

10:04.230 --> 10:06.840

10:06.840 --> 10:09.240
What? Seo Ji Won, you're dating?

10:09.240 --> 10:10.650
She's definitely dating.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.530
Wow. How did you know?

10:12.530 --> 10:15.140
Hey! Who are you dating?

10:15.140 --> 10:19.880
- Who are you dating? <br> - Wait, wait, that's why I came here.

10:22.370 --> 10:23.790
Oppa!

10:27.410 --> 10:29.500
I missed you.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.940
You didn't miss me?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.680
I have something to tell you.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.140
Lee Ran Ju seriously

10:48.140 --> 10:50.270
has to change her profession.

10:50.270 --> 10:54.170
Seriously, may be you should become a shaman or something?

10:54.170 --> 10:57.590
Why don't you stop glancing at your phone while talking?

10:57.590 --> 10:59.220
You aren't someone who keeps checking their phone.

10:59.220 --> 11:01.980
You must be waiting for a call because you are dating.

11:01.980 --> 11:05.630
As expected, nothing can surpass it when you're dating.

11:05.630 --> 11:08.030
What did I do?

11:08.030 --> 11:10.180
So, who is it?

11:10.180 --> 11:11.450
Who is it?

11:11.450 --> 11:14.060
By any chance, is it your first love?

11:15.830 --> 11:17.700
Looks like you're right.

11:17.700 --> 11:23.860
Seriously, it is a waste that you are in the broadcasting station.

11:23.860 --> 11:26.070
Didn't she say that dramas don't lie?

11:26.070 --> 11:29.070
That is true.

11:29.070 --> 11:31.830
Oh my god!

11:31.830 --> 11:33.480
- Why?<br>- What now?

11:33.480 --> 11:35.100
You slept with him.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.630
Wow, seriously awesome!

11:38.630 --> 11:42.670
Teacher Lee Ran Ju, please let my new series become number one. Seriously, please!

11:42.670 --> 11:45.570
- Please double my sales, please!<br> - More, more, more.

11:45.570 --> 11:50.240
- Please! - Please!<br> - Sincerely.

11:50.240 --> 11:55.730
- Would it work with this?!<br> - Ah, please!<br> - Okay.

11:55.730 --> 11:57.980
You're awesome.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.440
Your sixth sense really is amazing.

12:00.440 --> 12:05.470
But didn't you say you were tired of guys?

12:05.470 --> 12:08.870
Right.

12:08.870 --> 12:10.820
Maybe I have gone crazy.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.900
I am about to do it again.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.240
Even if you wanted to, you can't control your feelings.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.420
Even I find myself strange.

12:18.420 --> 12:21.360
Why am I like this?

12:21.360 --> 12:23.250
So,

12:24.020 --> 12:26.690
is he handsome?

12:26.690 --> 12:31.240
He is a bit good-looking.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.320
You are admirable Seo Ji Won.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.430
I thought you wouldn't love anyone anymore.

12:45.560 --> 12:50.280
It isn't love yet.

12:50.280 --> 12:55.370
We just... just slept together once.

12:55.370 --> 12:56.830
W...wow!

12:56.830 --> 13:01.140
Wow. You're thirty so you have one night stands now?

13:01.140 --> 13:04.520
It's nice, I like it. More, more.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.940
- Do it all. Good, good.<br>- Teach her good stuff!

13:07.940 --> 13:10.570
- You do it, too.<br>- Yes, you should, too.

13:10.570 --> 13:14.510
Nope. I reject. I'm fine.

13:14.510 --> 13:20.310
I can't believe I am having a meal with people inexperienced in dating!

13:20.310 --> 13:22.880
Hold on. Stop.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.840
Lee Ran Ju, no way...

13:26.840 --> 13:29.920
you slept with that cutie already?

13:29.920 --> 13:32.330
No.

13:32.330 --> 13:34.320
As expected, Lee Ran Ju.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.350
- Awesome. <br> - Cheers, cheers, cheers!

13:37.350 --> 13:40.320
Respect!

13:40.320 --> 13:44.010
Oh, What is this? Wow I feel betrayed!

13:44.010 --> 13:47.540
Betrayal!

13:47.540 --> 13:51.870
Wait a minute, I'll be back soon.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.950
- Why did she drink so much?<br>- She's drunk.

13:56.950 --> 13:59.150
Looks like it.

14:09.220 --> 14:11.770
Ji Won,

14:11.770 --> 14:17.020
you meeting someone and dating,

14:17.950 --> 14:20.840
it's all nice.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.890
But I'm worried.

14:23.890 --> 14:27.710
I'm afraid that you will get hurt again.

14:36.420 --> 14:40.170
Do I make you guys worry?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.980
Are you asking because you don't know?

14:47.130 --> 14:52.200
No. Now I won't do that.

14:54.690 --> 14:58.300
He won't hurt you right?

15:03.490 --> 15:05.650
- Did you forget?<br>- What?

15:05.650 --> 15:09.610
- We decided to become b*tches.<br>- Ah!

15:13.060 --> 15:18.600
And b*tches don't ever get hurt.

15:22.790 --> 15:24.690
But Ji Won,

15:25.780 --> 15:28.020
if a man makes a woman anxious

15:28.020 --> 15:30.920
after they sleep together,

15:32.140 --> 15:34.490
then he's not a good guy.
